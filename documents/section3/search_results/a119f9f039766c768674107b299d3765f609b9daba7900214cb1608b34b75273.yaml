    years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also called drones, have been widely used
    in precision agriculture applications, such as water stress estimation, pest monitoring,
    and crop yield estimation, because of the development of UAV technology and remote
    sensing sensors. However, how to collect data effectively can still be a big challenge.
    Many UAV tunable parameters can have significant impact on data quality and the
    data analysis, such as flight height, flight time, overlapping, and airspeed.
    And, little work has been done regarding to how to extract high-resolution multispectral
    or thermal images with limited ground-truth measurements. Therefore, in this paper,
    a UAV resolution and waveband aware design was conducted in order to optimally
    collecting remote sensing aerial images with drones. Then, the flight mission
    design was tested in an onion field at USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)
    during the growing season in 2017. Based on the research results, drones successfully
    provide farmers and researchers the fundamental knowledge of irrigation management
    to identify irrigation non-uniformity. Using multispectral and thermal images
    collected by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find
    the relationship between image features and onions irrigation treatments. It also
    found out that how drones flight height or resolution settings affect the accuracy
    of estimating onions irrigation treatment. Different spectral bands combination
    also has effect on onion irrigation treatment prediction. Published in: 2019 International

    GA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Over the past a few years, unmanned aerial vehicles
    have been widely used as a remote sensing platform in agricultural applications,
    such as crop yield estimation [1], soil moisture monitoring, water stress estimation
    [2] and pest management [3]. Compared with traditional remote sensing tools, such
    as satellites, drones’ flight time can be more flexible and more frequent in the
    field. And, drones can fly at lower altitude and can take higher resolution multispectral
    images or thermal images [4] of crops. As a low-cost scientific data collection
    platform, drones also make data acquisition relatively less expensive. While there
    are many advantages by using drones for agricultural applications [1], there is
    still a lot of work for drones. Many researchers fly the drones in different standard,
    using specialized equipment, controlling environments and relying on data analysis
    expertise [5]. Is there any optimal point where the data can be the best representation
    of crops? In [5], Brandon built a conceptual framework for describing the optimality
    as a function of spatial, spectral, and temporal factors which represent the best
    solution. How to collect remote sensing data effectively can still be a big challenge.
    Many UAV tunable parameters can have significant impact on data quality and the
    data analysis, such as flight height, flight time, overlapping, and airspeed.
    In this paper, flight height’s effect on data analysis was discussed. It assumed
    that there must be an optimal point where the data analysis results from multispectral
    images or thermal images can greatly represent for, for example, the crops water
    stress status [2] or other crop characteristics. In this paper, a resolution and
    waveband aware path planning was conducted in order to optimally collecting remote
    sensing aerial images with drones. Then, the flight mission design was tested
    in an onion field at USDA during the growing season in 2017. Onion is one of the
    most widely produced vegetables all over the world. And, onion also plays an important
    role in human diet and medical properties [6]. Therefore, onion is consumed among
    all nationalities and cultures [7]. Based on the data from Food and Agriculture
    Organization, onion production has been increasing continuously by 65 million
    tonne (1999 -2009 period), in an area of 2.1 million hectare in 2009 [7]. California
    is the biggest onion producer in the United States, which is also the only state
    that can produce spring and summer-harvested onions in the US. 31 % of the total
    onion in the US was produced in California in 2015 [8]. In the semi-arid and arid
    areas of California, onion production is highly dependent on irrigation. Water
    stress could happen in any onion growing stage and cause onion yield loss. Therefore,
    to optimize irrigation management, it’s important to have a optimal onion water
    stress monitoring method. Many research results have been published on using drones
    to detect water stress [9] [10] [11] [12] [13], which prove drones can be a reliable
    and effective remote sensing platform. In onion study area, multispectral cameras
    are mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicles for onions yield estimation, biomass
    monitoring [14], and disease detection [15]. However, to our best knowledge, nobody
    has studied drone flight height’s effect on onion’s multispectral images data
    analysis and irrigation treatment inference. Therefore, in this paper, we mainly
    designed an UAV flight mission in order to optimally collecting onion remote sensing
    aerial images with drones. By using multispectral and thermal images collected
    by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find the relationship
    between image features and onions irrigation treatments. We also figured out how
    drones flight height or resolution settings affect the accuracy of estimating
    onion irrigation treatment. Different spectral bands combination also has effect
    on onion irrigation treatment prediction. Fig. 1. Onion test site Show All The
    rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the material
    and methods we used for UAV. Results and discussions are presented in Section
    III. In Section IV, concluding remarks are presented for the resolution and waveband
    aware path planning results. SECTION II. Material and Methods A. Onion Study Area
    As shown in Fig. 1, the field study was conducted at the USDA-ARS, San Joaquin
    Valley Agricultural Sciences Center (36.594  ∘ N,119.512  ∘ W) , Palier, California,
    93648, USA. Since 2016, an onion test field has been set up for research of biomass
    soil amendments and deficit irrigation. There are three irrigation treatment levels
    and four soil amendments. Three irrigation levels are low, medium and high. The
    four soil amendments are biochar, check, biochar + compost, and biochar + compost
    +1 bag of sulfur. There are also three replicate plots for each treatment combination.
    B. An UAV platform and sensors In this paper, we used a Hover (brand of the UAV)
    quadcopter as the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. The Hover was equipped
    with a Pixhawk flight controller, GPS, telemetry antennas. And, it is able to
    fly over the onions field by waypoints mode (designed by using Mission Planner
    software). The Hover’s lithium polymer battery has a capacity of 9500 mAh, which
    can support a 30-minute flight mission with cameras mounted on the Hover drone.
    Multispectral images were collected by Survey 2 (MAPIR, USA) cameras with 4 bands,
    Blue, Green, Red (RGB) and Near-infrared (NIR). The MAPIR camera has a resolution
    of 4608 x 3456 pixels, with a space resolution at 1.01 cm/pix. The Survey 2 cameras
    have a faster interval timer, 2 seconds for JPG mode and 3 seconds for RAW + JPG
    mode. Faster interval timer would benefit the overlap design for UAV flight missions,
    such as reducing the flight time, enabling higher overlapping. The thermal camera
    ICI 9640 P-Series (ICI, USA) was applied for collecting onions’ thermal images.
    The thermal camera has a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The spectral band is
    from 7 μ m to 14 μ m. The dimensions of the thermal camera is 34mm × 30mm × 34mm.
    The accuracy is supposed to be ± 1 ∘ C . A Raspberry Pi Model B computer was used
    to trigger the thermal cameras during the flight missions. C. UAV images collection
    and preprocessing Flight missions were programmed by using Mission Planner software.
    The flight height was setup as 10m, 15m, 30m, and 60m in order to compare the
    resolution’s effect on onions irrigation treatment inference. For all the flight
    missions, the overlap was set up as 75% to make sure the onions’ images can be
    stitched together during images pre-processing. We flew the Hover drone bi-weekly
    over the onions field at noon during the growing season in 2017. The images of
    a color panel were taken right before and after the flight missions, servicing
    as the reflectance reference. After the flight missions, all of the aerial images
    were stitched together to generate the orthomosaick images in PhotoScan (Agisoft
    LLC, Russian). An RGB image is shown in Fig. 2, and an NIR image is shown in Fig.
    3. The process includes aligning photos and building orthomosaick. The Agisoft

    2. RGB image for onions field Show All D. Principal Component Analysis For image
    processing, we used two different machine learning methods, the Principle Component
    Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Both of them can reduce
    the datasets dimensionality and increase the classification accuracy. Principle
    Component Analysis (PCA) is a fast and flexible unsupervised method for data dimensionality
    reduction [16]. It can achieve linear projection to a lower-dimensional subspace
    by using singular value decomposition. PCA can also maximize the variance of the
    projected data. Therefore, PCA is widely used in exploratory data analysis and
    making predictive models. Fig. 3. NIR image for onions field Show All Fig. 4.
    36 plots of onion Show All E. Linear Discriminant Analysis Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA) is a classifier with a linear decision boundary. It is generated
    by using Bayes’ rule to fit class conditional densities to the data. It assumes
    that all classes share the same covariance matrix. After that, LDA model can be
    used to reduce the dimensionality of the input data by projecting it to the most
    discriminative directions. Then, the output dimensionality is usually less than
    the number of classes, so that LDA is a very strong dimensionality reduction [17].
    SECTION III. Results and Discussion To prepare the multispectral and thermal images
    data sets, we firstly segmented 36 plots from the whole onion field in order to
    focus only on the area of interest, as shown in Fig. 4. Every image was converted
    into 2048 dimensions vector for data processing by python packages. The data was
    distributed as 67% for training and 33% for testing. Several classifiers in scikit-learn
    machine learning algorithms were used for onions irrigation treatment inference,
    such as, ”Nearest Neighbors”, ”Linear SVM”, ”RBF SVM”, ”Gaussian Process”, ”Decision
    Tree”, ”Random Forest”, ”Neural Net”, ”AdaBoost”, ”Naive Bayes” and ”QDA”. Table
    I Differe Ntresolutions Accuracy for Onion Treatment Inference Table II Bands
    Configuration Accuracy for Onion Treatment Inference The accuracy was evaluated
    by scikit-learns accuracy classification score function. This function computes
    the subset accuracy, in which the labels predicted for a sampling must exactly
    match the corresponding true labels. Estimators use this score method as the evaluation
    criterion for the classification problems. All scorer objects follow the convention
    that higher return values are better than lower return values. We mainly discuss
    two topics in this section, flight height or different resolution’s effect on
    onion irrigation treatment estimation and different wavebands combination on onions
    irrigation treatment prediction. A. UAV flight height or resolution’s effect In
    this section, near-infrared images are used to analyze the flight height or image
    resolution’s effect on data analysis. At 30 meters height, the MAPIR has a resolution
    as 1.01 cm/ pix. By image processing, we set up 4 different resolutions, A, B,
    C D for onion images. Resolution A means 0.55 cm/pix, resolution B means 1.01
    cm/pix, resolution C means 2.02 cm/pix, and resolution D means 4.04 cm/pix, as
    shown in Table I. From the Table I, we can figure out that the best accuracy is
    0.726, which shows up when the resolution is at 2.02 cm/pixel by using ’Neural
    net’ classifier. Compared with the other classifiers, the ’Neural net’ classifier
    performs the best in all resolution levels. And based on most classifiers resolution
    analysis results in the Table I, it turns out that when we fly a drone in the
    field, higher resolution does not mean better analysis results. The best resolution
    does not promise the best estimation. And, based on the accuracy trend of ’Neural
    net’ classifier, for example, it exists an optimal point near 2.02 cm/pixel resolution
    when ’Neural net’ was applied for onions irrigation estimation. B. Waveband configuration’s
    effect In this section, remote sensing images are generated by using different
    wavebands configurations. There are red, green, blue (RGB), near-infrared (NIR),
    thermal (TIR), and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) wavebands being
    used in this section. As shown in Table II, there are four combinations being
    used, RGB-NIR, All bands, RGB-NIR-TIR and TIR. Because RGB and NIR has a higher
    resolution (1.01 cm/pixel) than thermal images resolution (9 cm/pixel), the multispectral
    images were pre-processed in order to match the thermal images resolution. From
    the Table II, we can figure out that the best accuracy is 0.840, which appears
    when the RGB-NIR-TIR waveband images were used by ’Gaussian process’ classifier.
    Compared with the other classifiers, the ’Gaussian process’ classifier performs
    the best in all wavebands configuration. And based on most classifiers resolution
    analysis results in the Table II, it turns out that when we fly a drone in the
    field, more wavebands information does not mean better analysis results. Knowing
    all the remote sensing data does not mean the best estimation. And, based on the
    accuracy of ’Gaussian process’ classifier, it’s meaningful to point out that TIR
    images itself can already get pretty good estimation results, as high as 0.792,
    which means we do not always need multispectral wavebands information for some
    coarse estimation research work. On the other side, adding RGB-NIR information
    does increase accuracy from 0.792 to 0.840, which is meaningful for precision
    agriculture applications. SECTION IV. Conclusions In this paper, a UAV resolution
    and waveband aware path planning was conducted in order to optimally collecting
    remote sensing aerial images with drones. Using multispectral and thermal images
    collected by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find
    the relationship between image features and onions irrigation treatments. First,
    we found out that the best accuracy for onion irrigation treatments is 0.726,
    which shows up when the resolution is at 2.02 cm/pixel by using ’Neural net’ classifier.
    And, the best resolution does not promise the best estimation. According to the
    accuracy trend of ’Neural net’ classifier, it does exist an optimal point near
    2.02 cm/pixel resolution when ’Neural net’ was applied for onions irrigation estimation.
    Second, this paper also found out that different spectral bands combination also
    has effect on onion irrigation treatment prediction. Applying all the remote sensing
    data does not mean the best estimation. And, based on the accuracy of ’Gaussian
    process’ classifier, we figured out that TIR images itself can already get relatively
    good estimation results for onions irrigation estimation, as high as 0.792, which
    means we do not always need multispectral bands information for it. On the other
    side, adding RGB-NIR information does increase accuracy from 0.792 to 0.840, which
    is important for precision agriculture applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks go

    Media Tables Share Abstract A brief history of development of the 1985 Hargreaves
    equation and its comparison to evapotranspiration (ET) predicted by the Food and
    Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Penman-Monteith method are
    described to provide background and information helpful in selecting an appropriate
    reference ET equation under various data situations. Early efforts in irrigation
    water requirement computations in California and other arid and semiarid regions
    required the development of simplified ET equations for use with limited weather
    data. Several initial efforts were directed towards improving the usefulness of
    pan evaporation for estimating irrigation water requirements. Similarity with
    climates of other countries allowed developments in California to be extended
    overseas. Criticism of empirical methods by H. L. Penman and others encouraged
    the search for a robust and practical method that was based on readily available
    climatic data for computing potential evapotranspiration or reference crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET o ) . One of these efforts ultimately culminated in the 1985 Hargreaves ET
    o method. The 1985 Hargreaves ET o method requires only measured temperature data,
    is simple, and appears to be less impacted than Penman-type methods when data
    are collected from arid or semiarid, nonirrigated sites. For irrigated sites,
    the Hargreaves 1985 ET o method produces values for periods of five or more days
    that compare favorably with those of the FAO Penman-Monteith and California Irrigation
    Management Information Services (CIMIS) Penman methods. The Hargreaves ET o predicted
    0.97 of lysimeter measured ET o at Kimberly, Idaho after adjustment of lysimeter
    data for differences in surface conductance from the FAO Penman-Monteith definition.
    Monthly ET o by the 1985 Hargreaves equation compares closely with ET o calculated
    using a simplified, “reduced-set” Penman-Monteith that requires air temperature
    data only. Formats available You can view the full content in the following formats:

    AgroDSS was developed. • Users can upload own data and process it using the online
    data mining tools. • AgroDSS provides predictive modeling, explanation and time
    series analysis. • Case study of pest population dynamics illustrates the potential
    for the use. Abstract Decision support systems, data analysis and data mining
    have become significant tools for improving business in professional world. The
    emerging technologies are making the precision agriculture omnipresent and allow
    potential for enriching it with computer-assisted decision support systems for
    farm management. In this paper we describe a novel system AgroDSS that bridges
    the gap between agricultural systems and state-of-the-art decision support methodology.
    The described system is intended for integration into the existing farm management
    information systems and provides a cloud-based decision support toolbox, allowing
    farmers to upload their own data, utilize several data analysis methods and retrieve
    their outputs. The implemented tools include predictive modeling with explanation,
    accuracy evaluation, time series clustering and decomposition, and structural
    change detection. They can help users make predictions for simulated scenarios
    and better understand the dependencies (interactions) within their domain. We
    apply the AgroDSS system on a case study of pest population dynamics, illustrating
    the potential for its use. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    Decision support systemAgricultureFarming 2000 MSC 68U3568T05 1. Introduction
    In mid 1990s, Heuvel (1996) wrote about precision agriculture – the big information
    upgrade in agriculture that was yet to arise. In his work he emphasized that the
    emerging technologies are driving the development of agriculture, which will be
    able to evolve to a more efficient level in terms of agricultural production and
    land stewardship. It seems that today we are in the era of making precision agriculture
    omnipresent, whilst trying to enrich it with computer-assisted Decision Support
    Systems (DSS) for entire farm management (with the goal of optimizing returns
    on inputs while preserving resources). The majority of marketed state-of-the-art
    software products for agriculture utilize various sensors to collect data, in
    contrast to history that involved manual data input (Kaloxylos et al., 2012, Sørensen
    et al., 2010). Although this results in large amounts of stored data, data is
    most frequently analyzed only with basic statistical or visualization methods.
    The latter neglects the potential for application of advanced data analysis tools
    that stem from the fields of data mining. The reason for this mostly lies in the
    fact that the development and deployment of advanced data mining methods demand
    cutting-edge knowledge and skills in understanding these methods. In this paper
    we describe a novel system AgroDSS that bridges the gap between agricultural systems
    and state-of-the-art decision support methodology. The described system is intended
    to provide computer decision support to farmers in an approachable manner. The
    system is designed as a decision support toolbox, where farmers can upload their
    own data of interest, utilize several offered artificial intelligence (data mining
    and statistical) tools and retrieve their outputs. The output results are intended
    to provide users with automated decision support, predictions for simulated scenarios,
    better understanding of the submitted data and explanation of the dependencies
    (interactions) within the data. As motivated by related work (Fountas et al.,
    2015a, Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Sørensen et al., 2011), AgroDSS is implemented
    as a cloud-based service, which enables various software products for agriculture
    to facilitate decision support to users. As many other existing decision support
    systems, we aim AgroDSS to be a tool that can improve business value through savings,
    avoiding risks, better planning and taking better advantage of resources. As AgroDSS
    can be used with different problem domains, business benefits depend on each individual
    business case; we conclude the paper by summarizing such a case study. The paper
    is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide a historical overview of how
    the computers and decision support systems have been used in agriculture and farming.
    In Section 3 we describe the design, functionalities and the implementation of
    the novel AgroDSS system. We proceed in Section 4 by providing a brief case study
    of pest analysis in orchards and fields, which serves as a demonstrative proof
    of concept. We conclude the paper in Section 5. 2. Related work Before the advent
    of precision agriculture, only a few works about use of information technologies
    in farming or agriculture were published. Through the time, use of decision support
    systems, data analysis, and data mining have become more significant tools for
    improving business in professional world. One of the earliest systems that provided
    computer-assisted decision support was CropSyst (Stöckle et al., 2003). Its development
    started in early 1990s and evolved into a suite of programs that include a cropping
    simulator, a weather generator, GIS (Geographic Information System) cooperator
    program, a watershed model, and several miscellaneous utility programs. According
    to the website1, the developed model simulates the soil water budget, soil-plant
    nitrogen budget, crop canopy and root growth, dry matter production, yield, residue
    production and decomposition, and erosion, using several parameters, such as cultivar
    selection, crop rotation, irrigation, nitrogen fertilization, tillage operations,
    and residue management. An important advantage of the contemporary systems is
    availability in a cloud (Ampatzidis et al., 2016, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), which
    can ensure greater availability of the systems to users and applications. Crop
    simulations and predictions. Many such systems for simulating crops through a
    myriad of tweakable variables were developed and evaluated with different crops
    and climate conditions. In more recent publications, Abedinpour et al. (2012)
    performed an evaluation of AquaCrop model for maize crop in a semi-arid environment.
    This model attempts to balance accuracy, simplicity and robustness by using a
    relatively small number of explicit and mostly intuitive parameters and input
    variables. These simulators can be successfully combined with other models; for
    example, García-Vila and Fereres (2012) combined AquaCrop with an economic model
    for the optimization of irrigation management at farm level. Irrigation management
    had become very important so dedicated models have spurred. Bazzani (2005) developed
    a Decision Support System for Irrigation for short and long term analyses of water,
    labor and machinery, considering different types of soils, irrigation systems,
    water-yield functions and seasonality trough multicriterial mathematical programming
    techniques; Paredes et al. (2014) examined partitioning evapotranspiration, yield
    prediction and economic returns of maize under various irrigation management strategies.
    Today, soil moisture is analyzed with inferential frameworks that combine data
    to infer moisture, precipitation, temperature and canopy coverage variation (Ghosh
    et al., 2014). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015) proposed a fuzzy decision support
    system, intended to improve the irrigation based on given crop and site characteristics.
    It comprises an inference system that outputs the best irrigation action to keep
    the soil moisture in the suitable bounds, resulting in significant water savings.
    In theory, the proposed models could be used with arbitrary crops, though in practice,
    many specific simulators for specific crops have been developed. For example,
    Mohanty et al. (2012) parameterized the APSIM model (Keating et al., 2003) for
    soybean and wheat crop of subtropical central India; Sepaskhah et al. (2013) developed
    a dynamic yield and growth model for saffron under different irrigation regimes;
    Dreassi et al. (2014) dealt with semicontinuous skewed spatial data of grape wine
    production; Sun and Ren (2014) assessed crop yield and optimize water scheduling
    for winter wheat and summer maize using soil and water assessment tool. In order
    to cope with the vast variability of nature and the uncertainties of agricultural
    production, the concept of crop biometrics was defined as the scientific analysis
    of agricultural observations confined to spaces of reduced dimensions and known
    position with the purpose of building prediction models (Rovira-Más and Sáiz-Rubio,
    2013). Dairy farms. Allore et al. (1995) made a data-driven decision support system
    MAST to systematically summarize the data related to mastitis; Kerr et al. (1999)
    developed a knowledge-based decision support system for strategic planning on
    sub-tropical dairy farms. More recently, Bryant et al. (2010) evaluated Farmax
    Dairy Pro that can predict annual yields (per cow and per hectare) for milk, fat,
    protein and milk solids. Baudracco et al. (2012) proposed e-Cow that predicts
    herbage intake, milk yield and live weight change in dairy cows grazing temperate
    pastures with and without supplementary feeding. Other examples of DSS for farming.
    Perini and Susi (2004) focused on design issues faced during the development of
    a DSS to be used by technicians of the advisory service performing pest management
    according to an integrated production approach. Abdullah and Hussain (2006) put
    decades worth of pest scouting recordings, agriculture and metrological data into
    a novel Pilot Agriculture Extension Data Warehouse and present some interesting
    findings through data mining using an indigenous technique based on the crossing
    minimization paradigm. Xu et al. (2008) proposed a systematic approach based on
    integrated information systems for agricultural ecosystem management that extracts
    and integrates data about terrain, land use and planting. Sustainable agriculture
    was discussed by Kurlavičius (2009), where they proposed a DSS that predicts what
    kind of crops should be grown in particular areas, what/how many animals should
    be kept and what/how much of resources are required under the environmental and
    other conditions. Antonopoulou et al. (2010) proposed a Web-based Decision Support
    System to help farmers select the alternative crops and provide the information
    about the cultivation period. Cloud-based decision support services. Kaloxylos
    et al. (2012) surveyed the key functionalities of Farm Management Information
    Systems (FMIS) and possibilities for their future improvement. They emphasized
    that farmers need the global market of services in the cloud, which can collect
    joint intelligence that can be used to extend their FMIS. Furthermore, the authors
    predict that the solutions/tools for intelligence might in the future be located
    solely in the cloud, which requires the intelligence to be distributed between
    the cloud and farms to compensate for lack of a stable Internet link in fields
    and rural areas. In their further work, Kaloxylos et al. (2014) presented a conceptual
    implementation of a cloud-based FMIS for managing a greenhouse. Farmers who evaluated
    the FMIS characterized the use of services in the cloud as valuable due to possibility
    of selecting and changing a service provider, availability of decision support
    services, and open and standardized interfaces of the cloud FMIS that can enable
    cooperation among stakeholders. Fountas et al. (2015a) have explored future perspectives
    of FMIS and advocate that cloud computing will be one of the key drivers in their
    future development. Nikkilä et al. (2010) and Tayyebi et al. (2016) argue that
    FMIS for precision agriculture needs access to various systems and propose a concept
    of multi-tier architecture where any application can access FMIS data through
    web services exposed by FMIS. Sørensen et al. (2011) explore the concept of external
    assisting services, such as ones that can be implemented in a cloud, to facilitate
    standardized data exchange formats, data semantics, and transformation of data
    into useful knowledge for decision making. Tan (2016) brought to attention that
    the further development of precision agriculture requires advanced tools to process
    data and transform them to practical decision actions. He developed a cloud-based
    decision support system, which allows easier extensibility, integration of data
    from various sources (in different formats and semantics) and centralized control
    of field devices. 2.1. Decision support systems methods and approaches In the
    related work, several different decision support models and approaches, which
    are based on data mining, have been used. In the following we summarize their
    most common occurrences in the literature: • Probabilistic and optimization models:
    For sow herding, Pla et al. (2004) developed a decision support system based on
    an embedded Markov model, while Pomar and Pomar (2005) developed a system in Milord
    II for efficient early identification of sows having low prolificacy performance
    in commercial pig farms. Scott et al. (2015) proposed a method for selecting appropriate
    suppliers that considers stakeholder requirements. They integrated their basic
    method, called Analytic Hierarchy Process–Quality Function Deployment (AHP–QFD),
    with constrained programming and validated it within the bioenergy industry. Thomopoulos
    et al. (2015) proposed an argumentation-based decision support system for agri-food
    chains that aims to optimize the nutritional, sensorial, practical and hygienic
    value of the food quality. Their system incorporates backward logical reasoning,
    starting from the goal, utilizing knowledge elicitation from domain experts or
    scientific papers. Although the authors conclude that the task of knowledge modeling
    cannot be automated, they emphasize the importance of argumentation and modeling
    in decision support systems. • Supervised learning models: It is worth mentioning
    that the well-known data mining software WEKA (Witten et al., 2016) started as
    a project, funded from 1993 by the New Zealand government, aimed to create a data
    mining workbench for contributing also to the agricultural industries (Hall et
    al., 2009). WEKA today features an abundance of supervised learning algorithms,
    used by a wide research community. For example, Ramesh and Ramar (2011) used WEKA
    to be the first to evaluate data mining techniques for Tamil Nadu (state of India)
    soil data sets. They compared the performance of the decision trees, naive Bayes
    classifier and random forests and achieved 100% classification accuracy with the
    latter two. Today, many other implementation of classification and regression
    algorithms have been applied in various application areas; we provide some typical
    examples below. Cortez et al. (2009) used the support vector machines (SVM) to
    outperform neural networks and multiple regression for predicting the human wine
    preferences (quality of wine) from objective physicochemical analytical tests.
    Their model revealed, which variables can be controlled during the production,
    providing a direct insight into ways for improving wine quality. Rumpf et al.
    (2010) tackled the problem for an early detection of sugar beet diseases using
    the SVM. They achieved the classification accuracy of up to 97% for differentiation
    of healthy vs. diseased leaves and classification accuracy between 65% and 90%
    (depending on the type and stage of the disease) for early detection of diseases.
    Pradhan (2013) compared the prediction performance of decision trees (DT), support
    vector machine and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for landslide
    susceptibility problem in Malaysia using aerial photographs. They built several
    models from different input attribute sets and achieved good predictive performance,
    especially with DT and ANFIS. Irmak et al. (2006) applied the back-propagation
    neural network to predict the spatial distribution of soybean yields and to understand
    the causes of yield variability. The goal of Panda et al. (2010) was to investigate
    the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for corn crop yield prediction
    using neural network techniques. They showed that the corn yield was best predicted
    (with accuracy of 83.50–96.04%) using models that used the means and standard
    deviations of perpendicular vegetation index grid images. Karimi et al. (2006)
    compared the performance of support vector machine with artificial neural networks
    (ANN) for classification of hyperspectral images of corn fields in order to predict
    nitrogen application and weed infestation rates. They achieved favorable results,
    showing lower misclassification rates of SVM for that task than those of ANN.
    In the last decade, the advantages of the random forest classifier have been emphasized,
    including its non-parametric nature, high predictive ability, internal evaluation
    of attributes, robustness to noise, and lack of proneness to overfitting. Several
    researches have shown its high predictive value: Oliveira et al. (2012) compared
    it with the multiple regression on a fire occurrence in Mediterranean Europe domain;
    Rodriguez-Galiano et al. (2012) evaluated its use for land cover classification;
    Tatsumi et al. (2015) used it for crop classification of homogeneous landscapes.
    • Bayesian models: Wang et al. (2012) developed a Bayesian hierarchical model
    that naturally combines information from multiple monthly surveys measured on
    different temporal supports, including field measurement surveys and two farmer
    interview surveys. Their results indicate that the hierarchical model produces
    superior forecasts to both the panel of experts and the composite estimator of
    the mean of a normal distribution, while providing an accurate measure of uncertainty.
    • Other classification models: The paper of Waheed et al. (2006) investigates
    the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing data for providing better crop management
    information for use in precision farming. In the study, the ability of the classification
    and regression trees (CART) decision tree algorithm were examined to classify
    hyperspectral data of experimental corn plots into categories of water stress,
    presence of weeds and nitrogen application rates. Li et al. (2012) were modeling
    maize irrigation with WOFOST simulator, they performed an additional analysis
    of uncertainty that revealed new insight into the risks associated with individual
    decisions. Du et al. (2013) presented a new algorithm for forecasting demand for
    perishable farm products, based on the support vector machine. To fit a Gamma
    model, to get small area estimates and to evaluate their precision, Dreassi et
    al. (2014) used a hierarchical Bayesian approach in their Small area estimation
    for semicontinuous skewed spatial data (an application to the grape wine production
    in Tuscany). • Time series analysis: Michel and Makowski (2013) compared the performance
    of seven basic statistical models and the dynamic linear model, for analyzing
    yield time series and prediction of yield trends. They visualized yield increase
    rates obtained with a dynamic linear model for wheat from 1960 to 2010. • Genetic
    programming: Alhadidi et al. (2012) proposed and evaluated a mathematical model
    that describes the reported data on crop pests to get an accurate prediction of
    production costs, food safety, and the protection of the environment. Their proposed
    approach is based on genetic programming and is explicitly directed at solving
    the symbolic regression of crop pest forecasting. Forecasting agricultural output
    with an improved grey forecasting model based on the genetic algorithm was performed
    by Ou (2012). Rose et al. (2016) surveyed the available decision support tools
    in the UK and discovered that 49% of farmers used some kind of decision support
    tool to inform decisions. They determined that effectiveness of decision support
    is influenced by fifteen following characteristics: performance, ease of use,
    peer recommendation (encouragement of knowledge exchange), trust, cost, matching
    to farmers’ existing habits, relevance, targeting of advisers, user age compatibility,
    scale of business, farming type, IT education, infrastructure (internet, devices,
    workflows), compliance with market and legislation, and level of marketing. Based
    on the surveyed work we conclude that decision support systems have been extensively
    studied for various aspects of agriculture and farming. The related work shows
    an increasing demand for (1) predictive modeling, (2) data understanding and (3)
    statistical data analysis, which motivates us to propose a system that can provide
    a simplified utilization of such algorithms. In regard to positive characteristics
    of random forests (Oliveira et al., 2012, Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012, Tatsumi
    et al., 2015), which include the model’s non-parametric nature, high predictive
    ability, internal evaluation of attributes, robustness to noise, and avoidance
    of overfitting, we decide to implement it as a predictive model within AgroDSS.
    We intend to address at least six factors of effectiveness, given by (Rose et
    al., 2016) (performance, ease of use, matching to farmers’ existing habits, relevance,
    farming type) that can be easily addressed technologically and by offering non-domain-specific
    data mining algorithms. We present the chosen data mining algorithms and the proposed
    system in the following sections. 3. Decision support system AgroDSS In the recent
    years, farm management information systems (FMIS) have evolved from simple farm
    recordkeeping into sophisticated and complex systems to support all aspects of
    production management (Fountas et al., 2015b). The purpose of modern FMIS is to
    manage demands to reduce production costs, comply with agricultural standards,
    and maintain high product quality and safety by ensuring access to timely information,
    elaborate estimation, simulation and decision making tools. Decision support system
    that integrates all of the above is therefore a crucial step in both day-to-day
    and strategic decision making. In this paper we describe a novel decision support
    system for agriculture and farming, called AgroDSS. The decision support aspect
    of the proposed system is based on data mining approaches, which can extract useful
    information from large volumes of data. Data mining uses advanced algorithms to
    analyze the data and identify trends, distributions and find patterns that can
    be hard to see with the naked eye. The newly acquired knowledge can help better
    understand the data, see how data changes in time and help predict the future
    impact of different actions. The modular architecture of AgroDSS allows easy (generic)
    integration of API services into existing FMIS, and also exposes a simplified
    Web user interface (UI) to the end-user (farmer). While the integration with web
    services is intended as a primary use of AgroDSS, the Web UI only represents an
    additional demonstration/evaluation tool. The main production use of the AgroDSS
    will therefore originate from within FMIS, where data is to be prepared and submitted
    for evaluation, and results presented without unnecessary user interaction. The
    intermediate purpose of the AgroDSS will be to model the data and evaluate the
    produced models. Although AgroDSS utilizes data mining algorithms, it is designed
    in a way that is approachable also to non-experts in the field. While integration
    of API services into existing FMIS requires a programmer’s knowledge (only during
    the integration), the farmers are the primary users that should provide the domain
    knowledge prior to the integration, i.e., define what the problem for the analysis
    is (e.g., prediction of a certain phenomenon, what is a target prediction variable,
    change detection, seasonality analysis etc.). After the integration, the use should
    become routine, allowing farmers to run and understand the analyses with no difficulty.
    We approached planning, design and implementation of the AgroDSS system by considering
    the well-known Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) (Chapman
    et al., 2000, Shearer, 2000), illustrated in Fig. 1. This standard encompasses
    good practices for applying data mining techniques and defines the phases of data
    mining process: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation,
    modeling, evaluation and deployment. The CRISP-DM process model therefore breaks
    down the life cycle of a data mining project into the six phases, which all include
    a variety of tasks. The relation of CRISP-DM phases to the AgroDSS workflow steps
    is depicted in Fig. 2. The workflow steps (step 1 – dataset creation, optional
    step 2 – dataset update, step 3 – quick data analysis, step 4 – training a predictive
    model, step 5 – model evaluation, and step 6 – predictive analysis) typically
    comprise one or more CRISP-DM phases. CRISP-DM phases are related to AgroDSS workflow
    steps (Fig. 2) as follows: 1. Business (problem) understanding: focuses on understanding
    the project objectives from business (user’s) perspective and transforming it
    into a data mining problem (domain) definition. At the end of the phase the project
    plan is produced. In AgroDSS, this phase is a precondition for step 1 (users –
    farmers – should know what their farming problem is). 2. Data understanding: starts
    with an initial raw data collection and proceeds with activities such as getting
    familiar with data, discovering first insights into the data and identifying possible
    data quality problems. In AgroDSS, this phase is a precondition for step 1. In
    order to utilize the AgroDSS Web user interface, the user (farmer) should possess
    a reasonable amount of domain and technical knowledge. He should be able to define
    the decision problem (e.g., how to improve cattle feeding in order to increase
    milk production), identify relevant collected data (e.g., feed composition, daily
    milk production), format and upload the data, and review the results. However,
    in a real-life situation the AgroDSS services will be integrated into a FMIS that
    will handle the problem definition (if not pre-defined) and all the data handling
    process. 3. Data preparation: covers all activities to construct the final data
    set from the initial raw data including selection of data, data cleaning, the
    construction of data, the integration of data and the data formatting. In AgroDSS,
    this phase corresponds to steps 1, 2 and 3 (creation of a dataset and partial
    uploads of data, as well as basic data analysis – descriptive statistics). While
    the data preparation step is mandatory and time-consuming for the demonstrational
    AgroDSS Web interface users, this will be different in practice – the data will
    be collected and preprocessed in FMIS, and after selecting the required analysis,
    the data preparation phase will commence automatically, followed by communication
    using the AgroDSS API services. 4. Modeling: covers the creation of various data
    mining models. The phase starts with the selection of data mining methods, proceeds
    with the creation (training) of data mining models and finishes with the assessment
    of the models. Some data mining methods have specific requirements on the form
    of data and the step back to data preparation phase is often necessary. In AgroDSS,
    this phase corresponds to step 4 (depending of the problem type, users can select
    appropriate data mining methods). 5. Evaluation: evaluates the data mining models
    created in the modeling phase. The aim of the model evaluation is to confirm that
    the models are of high enough quality to achieve the business objectives. In AgroDSS,
    this phase corresponds to step 5 (depending of the problem type, users can visualize
    evaluation reports for their datasets). 6. Deployment: comprises of activities
    to organize knowledge gained through data mining models and present it in a way
    users can use it within their decision making workflow. In AgroDSS, this phase
    corresponds to step 6. The selected trained model is stored for future re-use,
    and can be retrieved and utilized at any time. The storing of the model is performed
    by serializing an R model object (R Core Team, 2014), which is returned after
    the model’s generation, and saving it as a string into the database. Download

    AgroDSS System. The boldface text denotes the CRISP-DM steps and text in the rounded
    rectangles denotes the AgroDSS workflow steps. The latter are: dataset creation
    (step 1), update (optional step 2), quick data analysis (step 3), training a predictive
    model (step 4), model evaluation (step 5) and predictive analysis (step 6). Steps
    within the workflow relate to corresponding phases of the CRISP-DM model. We designed
    the AgroDSS system with the following main goals: • We aimed to implement a flexible
    and easy-to-use system that can be also used by non-experts from the data mining
    field. • The data mining tools should work with data from various domains; the
    system should therefore allow users to upload and process their own data. Minimal
    requirements about the data format (tabular form) should be defined. • The implemented
    collection of data mining tools should be general enough to be used with various
    problem domains. It should cover analyses from diverse subfields of data mining,
    such as supervised learning (predictive modeling), unsupervised learning (clustering),
    and time series analysis. • Users should receive numeric or visual feedback with
    the results of their queries. • The system should be online and easily accessible
    to users. • The system’s tools should be accessible by other information systems
    through an application programming interface (API). The final architecture of
    the AgroDSS system is illustrated in Fig. 2. In step 1, the data for the analysis
    needs to be uploaded (in CSV format, target/dependent variable in the first column)
    to be made available for the data mining algorithms. To do this, the users create
    and name a new dataset. At any later time, data can be optionally appended to
    existing uploaded datasets (step 2), which is useful if we are dealing with periodic
    data collections (e.g. daily measurements). Afterwards, users can either run any
    of the quick data analyses (step 3; clustering, structural analysis and sequence
    decomposition) or train a predictive model (step 4) that is required for making
    predictions. Users can either evaluate the accuracy of the predictive model on
    training or on independent test data (step 5) or use model to make predictions
    (step 6) for new, yet unseen data or for the simulated scenarios. 3.1. Decision
    support functionalities Following the goals, described in the previous section,
    we implemented the following data mining function within the AgroDSS system: 1.
    Data upload and preprocessing. The function provides the farmers to upload their
    data, which subsequently becomes stored on the server. The uploaded data is required
    to be in tabular form, where the rows represent individual observations (examples)
    and columns represent attributes (different descriptives of the current example).
    Since the input data may contain missing values and many data mining algorithms
    require a full data table, the preprocessing options allow automatic imputation
    of missing values. For imputation, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (with k = 10)
    was used, which utilizes the most similar examples to deduce and fill-in the missing
    values. 2. Predictive modeling with explanation. (a) Predictive modeling function
    builds a data mining model from a given dataset (training dataset) that was uploaded
    to the server. The resulting data model can be afterwards used to make predictions
    for examples in another dataset from the same problem domain (testing dataset).
    To model the data, random forest prediction model was used. Along with modeling
    the training set, the model performance is also estimated using the out-of-bag
    (OOB) error that is assessed internally as the random forest is being constructed.
    Each tree in the random forest is namely trained using a different bootstrap sample
    (leaving out about one third of the examples) and its performance is unbiasedly
    estimated on the left-out examples. The system automatically selects the appropriate
    performance measure, depending on the type of the target variable – classification
    accuracy for classification problems (discrete target variable) and the mean squared
    error for regression problems (continuous target variable). Additionally, the
    random forest model also outputs the importance of individual attributes (estimated
    by the accuracy decrease given different attribute permutations and by the Gini
    index decrease after a node split over all trees) for predicting the outcome,
    which can be useful for post hoc feature selection performed by the user in FMIS.
    (b) Prediction computation function for computing predictions for testing dataset
    or new examples. (c) Explanation of the learned knowledge in the model that computes
    contributions of examples’ attribute values and returns its visual representation.
    The computed contributions represent the explanation of the learned knowledge
    within the prediction model (Štrumbelj et al., 2009, Štrumbelj and Kononenko,
    2010). The absolute size of a contribution value is an indicator of the attribute’s
    influence on the final decision, while its sign signifies whether the particular
    attribute value influenced the class probability in a positive way (by raising
    the predicted probability of the class) or negative way (by lowering the predicted
    probability of the class). As such, they explain the importance of different attributes
    and may reveal new knowledge about the problem domain. (d) Predictive accuracy
    analysis plot that shows the dependency of the predictive error on the number
    of trees, returned from the random forest prediction model. 3. Time series analysis:
    (a) Time series clustering that is intended for discovering similarities within
    a dataset and represent them in separate data groups. To implement this function
    we used the Permutation Distribution Clustering method (Brandmaier, 2015) that
    is tailored to clustering time series. The clustering method finds similar time
    series by observing differences between data permutation distributions. The method
    is robust and suitable for time series with changing distributions (i.e. containing
    concept drift) and with changing lengths. (b) Time series decomposition function
    decomposes a time series into seasonal, trend and irregular components using moving
    averages. The function is intended for detection of periodic as well as extraordinary
    events in the time stream. The decomposition was peformed using function decompose
    within statistical package R (R Core Team, 2014). (c) Structural change detection
    that is intended to detect abrupt changes in dynamics of time series. Such function
    can be beneficial in case of population or parameter modeling, where alarms need
    to be raised in case of big data changes. For implementation of this function
    we utilized the strucchange library (Zeileis et al., 2003) in statistical package
    R (R Core Team, 2014). 3.2. System architecture We implemented the data mining
    infrastructure using the WildFly Application Server2, custom R server and PostgreSQL
    DB Server as a data persistence layer. The system architecture (shown in Fig.
    3) allows use of the data mining services via a REST API. The core of data processing
    and computation is implemented in R – a statistical software package suited for
    data mining tasks (R Core Team, 2014). For the purposes of development and service
    exploration we have also implemented an HTML web interface. We used the following
    R libraries: • RCurl: for connecting to external data sources, • RPostgreSQL:
    for connecting to the PostgreSQL database, • jsonlite: support for JSON data format,
    • cluster: for data clustering, • strucchange: for finding structural changes
    in time series, • pdc: for clustering time series data, • randomForest: for classification
    and regression using random forests. Download : Download high-res image (123KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Architecture of the implemented AgroDSS
    system. The database provides storage for users’ data, requested tasks, and their
    results. Task execution is performed asynchronously, guided with task queuing
    and facilitated using the Wildfly application server (EJB Message Driven Beans).
    When user requests a data analysis, only meta-data (name of the dataset, analysis
    type and other parameters) are retrieved from the database and sent to the R data
    mining server. The R server afterwards requests the actual dataset contents and
    runs the analysis. The results are saved into the database and are available to
    be presented to the user, who can retrieve them using a task’s unique ID. The
    database also stores data from autonomous weather stations (in real time), provided
    by one of the AgroIT project partners (see Section 4), and sample test benchmark
    datasets. The weather data can be used to augment other data, if spatially proximate
    weather data is available. The available test datasets include: iris (prediction
    of the Iris flower species, Anderson (1935)), beavers (body temperature series
    of two beavers, Reynolds (1994)) and chickwts (chicken weights by feed type, McNeil
    (1977)). The REST API includes an option to adjust the randomForest modeling to
    specific use cases by providing alternative settings for default values of parameters:
    ntree (the number of trees to grow), mtry (number of randomly sampled variables
    at each split), and maxnodes (maximum number of terminal nodes). The services,
    implemented as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), can be used through REST API3. Its
    main request/response interface is described in Table 1, and the user interface
    of the developed system is shown in Fig. 4. Table 1. Interface of the implemented

    and fields After the development of the system, a small case study was performed
    on data that were obtained from one of the partners (EFOS d.o.o., Slovenia) that
    collaborated within the EU-funded project AgroIT. The goals of the AgroIT project
    were to implement a cloud platform for integration of existing applications for
    farming, and to facilitate the pilot use of those applications. As a part of the
    AgroIT, four pilot projects were initiated in four EU countries, including the
    TrapView4 platform that was implemented by EFOS. TrapView enables pest monitoring
    in vineyards and orchards through pest traps. Pests are lured into pest traps,
    where their photos are taken with a certain frequency and transmitted to TrapView
    servers over mobile network for analysis and pest recognition. Our case study
    was performed on pests data, collected by TrapView. The objective of the case
    study was to briefly demonstrate AgroDSS functionalities, illustrate the system’s
    use, and provide examples of the obtained results – thus, to serve as a proof-of-concept.
    The data includes measurements on various locations in four European countries
    between May 2014 and December 2015. Each measurement includes a description of
    the location (country, spatial coordinates and location type that can be one of:
    field, forest, orchard or vineyard), a description of the measuring device (model
    and device id), the timestamp of the measurement, the type of measurement (automatic,
    manually reviewed), the count of trapped pests, and the type of pest species.
    A sample of the collected data is shown in Fig. 5. One of farmers using TrapView
    was tackling the problems of predicting the pest population size, its dynamics
    and its potential anomalies (e.g. trap failure, maintenance problems). To address
    these goals, we decided to perform time series clustering for stream similarity
    detection (functionality 3a from Section 3.1), time series decomposition (functionality
    3b), and structural change detection (functionality 3c). We found that the remaining
    functionalities were not relevant for analysis in this problem domain; some of
    their use is, however, illustrated in the screenshot of the system in Fig. 4.

    study. Changes in the population of pests in each single location represent a
    time series, which we uploaded to the AgroDSS system and analyzed. A visualization
    example of such time series (data stream) is shown in Fig. 6. The data refer to
    the Plum fruit moth captured in an orchard in Poland. Each point represents the
    maximum value of the measurements from that day. Download : Download high-res

    series expressing pest population in a single location. Performed time series
    clustering enabled us to perform stream similarity analysis, as shown in Fig.
    7. The clustering dendrogram (tree) shows separation of all available data streams
    into several groups according to their mutual similarity. By observing similarities
    one can quickly deduce that they differ in the pest population dynamics. Two sequences
    at the bottom (denoted with black lines) seem smoother than the above four sequences
    (denoted with grey lines). By further analyzing the results of clustering, it
    turned out that each group represents different pest species – the four black
    sequences represent species Ostrinia nubilalis and two black sequences represent
    the Codling moth species. This example demonstrates how clustering tools can be
    used to automatically detect similarities between independent data streams. Afterwards,
    users can further utilize this acquired knowledge to determine the factors that
    affect the detected data similarities, or to automatically detect the anomalies
    in the data. An example of the latter would be a detected sudden difference between
    expectedly similar data stream (measuring points), which could indicate a fault
    in measuring devices or procedures. Download : Download high-res image (138KB)

    us to detect abrupt changes in population dynamics. Fig. 8 illustrates points
    in time (dashed vertical lines) where the underlying methodology detected such
    changes, while the horizontal lines represent the average values of measurements
    on individual segments. Such sudden and unexpected changes in the structure of
    sequences can represent an argument for automatic raising of alarms and notifying
    experts about the event that could alternatively also indicate a malfunction of
    the measuring equipment. For the users of the AgroDSS Web user interface the alarms
    basically mean just significant structural changes in the time series. However,
    for a particular problem, and within an appropriately configured FMIS with automatic
    data preparation and evaluation, it will be possible to daily check for significant
    anomalies and raise alarms in order to notify either the farmer or the problem
    expert. In our specific case study of observing pests population dynamics, the
    farmer could be notified of anomalies, indicating an early need to replace the
    overfull sticky plate or the pheromone bait. On the other hand, for some anomalies
    (such as unseasonably early occurrence of specific pests) the domain expert (e.g.
    from the company EFOS) could be informed as well, so that he could raise the alarm
    for a wider area or nationwide. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download

    dynamics (indicated by vertical lines). Fig. 9 shows the decomposition of a measurement
    sequence into the seasonal, trend and remainder (random) components. The trend
    component shows the overall movement in the measurements and offers the possibility
    of further analyzes (e.g. searching for causal relationships between different
    factors and the observed trend within the pest population). The seasonal component
    (in this particular case, the basic cycle represents one week) provides insights
    into processes that drive the pests population. Within our case study, the analysis
    allows detection of the increasing global trend of caught pest population over
    time, as well as detection of the seasonal periodic cycles that correlate with
    weekly cycles. The sum of the trend, seasonal and remainder components equals
    the original data series. The bars on the right hand side of the plot represent
    the same data range, allowing a relative comparison of the magnitudes of each
    component. Relatively low magnitudes of the seasonal component (denoted by a high
    vertical bar) suggest that the weekly variability in the pest population is negligible.

    allows better understanding of underlying patterns in a time series: the trend
    component represents a long-term change in the data, the seasonal component represents
    a repetitive pattern with a fixed period, and the remainder represents variations
    in the data that remain unexplained after the other components have been removed.
    The farmers and analysts from the AgroIT project team reported that the use of
    AgroDSS brought a significant added value to TrapView users. Although TrapView
    already contained its own decision support module that is based on monitoring,
    it was not able to make predictions for the future. AgroDSS supplemented the basic
    decision support with predictive functionalities that enabled farmers to effectively
    plan spraying according to the predicted population size of particular pest species.
    For example, given the prediction that a particular pest will be at the stage
    of deposition of larvae in three days at a particular location of TrapView, a
    farmer is able to timely purchase and plan the use of a spray that is dedicated
    exactly for that particular stage of larvae deposition. Additionally, the project
    analysts also calculated the financial outcomes due to the use of AgroDSS functionalities.
    Within the analyses, the data from the first two years of the AgroDSS use (2015
    and 2016) were compared to the average data of three years preceding the integration
    with AgroDSS (2012–2014). Table 2 displays the results for three farms (denoted
    with A, B and C) that were able to provide reliable data from their ERP systems.
    The data show that the use of the AgroDSS positively influenced two key factors
    that contribute to a better financial outcome: (1) the increased crop quality,
    resulting in higher gained price of crop, and (2) the decreased spraying costs,
    caused by a lower number of needed sprayings. Note that although the cost of insecticide
    sprays slightly differed between farms and between years (the difference was less
    than 1.5%), the number of yearly sprayings decreased from 6 or 7 to 4 or 5. Table

    4.020 5. Conclusion The emerging technologies are making the precision agriculture
    omnipresent and allow potential for enriching it with computer-assisted decision
    support systems for farm management. We developed a system AgroDSS that provides
    a cloud-based decision support toolbox, allowing farmers to upload their own data,
    utilize several data analysis methods and retrieve their outputs. The implemented
    tools include predictive modeling with explanation, accuracy evaluation, time
    series clustering and decomposition, and structural change detection. Within the
    short case study we outlined potential benefits of the implemented tools that
    can enable knowledge extraction from the data and optimization of business. While
    the AgroDSS Web user interface demonstrates the system’s functionalities, the
    main use is provided by the REST API that allows straightforward integration with
    existing FMIS and enables the full use of AgroDSS services even for non-technical
    users. The CRISP-DM process model, as described in full in the paper, is not a
    practical solution for the majority of users, as the first three steps (problem
    understanding, data understanding and data preparation) require domain expert
    and data expert knowledge. These steps are to remain firmly within the FMIS –
    a farmer will need to specify the problem and data sources, the data will be prepared
    and submitted to the AgroDSS service. AgroDSS therefore provides a tool to address
    the steps in the second half of the CRISP-DM that can be automated: modeling,
    evaluation, and the majority of deployment (by visually presenting the learned
    knowledge). Once deployed, a model will easily be utilized from the FMIS. Within
    our further work we shall pursue the implementation of additional functionalities
    within the AgroDSS system. The further development will include (1) development
    of additional predictive models (such as naive Bayes, decision trees and neural
    networks) and ensemble learning (bagging), (2) possibility of model evaluation
    on independent test sets (including computation of evaluation measures, such as:
    sensitivity, specificity and F1-measure for classification; (relative) mean squared
    error and (relative) mean absolute error for regression), and (3) inclusion of
    feature selection methods (ReliefF, information gain, Gini index). Although currently
    implemented random forests allows good accuracy and robustness, we shall implement
    the additional predictive models to offer additional tools that can improve either
    interpretability (naive Bayes, decision trees) or predictive accuracy. Namely,
    the developing field of deep learning using neural networks allows automatic construction
    of new features that can improve capabilities of predictive modeling systems.
    Evaluation on independent test sets, additional performance measures and feature
    selection methods shall allow users to evaluate data either prior to learning
    or longitudinally. They shall enable greater control of the built model’s quality
    and signal the possible need to repeat the learning process. Possibilities to
    implement other data mining algorithms are also open – however, this demand shall
    be driven by specific business requirements of users, who represent the crucial
    part of the AgroDSS development process. Acknowledgments The AgroDSS system has
    been developed within the AgroIT project, which has been co-financed through the
    European union programme CIP-ICT PSP. The authors thank EFOS d.o.o., Slovenia,

    \ spatio-temporal variations of crop\nmorphological and physiological status and\
    \ supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison\nwith multispectral\
    \ imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable\n\
    of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility\
    \ outside of\nthe scientiﬁc community, hyperspectral images have not been widely\
    \ used in precision agriculture.\nIn recent years, diﬀerent mini-sized and low-cost\
    \ airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall\nMicro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD\
    \ 185-Fireﬂy) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI).\n\
    Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications.\
    \ Meanwhile,\nthe acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery\
    \ still remain a challenging research\ntopic (e.g., large data volume, high data\
    \ dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is\nhence beneﬁcial to\
    \ conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology\n\
    (e.g., diﬀerent platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing\
    \ hyperspectral\ninformation, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in\
    \ agricultural applications. Publications\nover the past 30 years in hyperspectral\
    \ imaging technology and applications in agriculture were\nthus reviewed.\nThe\
    \ imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in\nthe literature,\
    \ were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for diﬀerent applications\n\
    (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics,\
    \ and crop classiﬁcation)\nwere also evaluated. This review is intended to assist\
    \ agricultural researchers and practitioners to\nbetter understand the strengths\
    \ and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications\nand promote\
    \ the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral\n\
    imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.\nKeywords: precision\
    \ agriculture; remote sensing; hyperspectral imaging; platforms and sensors;\n\
    analytical methods; crop properties; soil characteristics; classiﬁcation of agricultural\
    \ features\n1. Introduction\nThe global agricultural sector is facing increasing\
    \ challenges posed by a range of stressors,\nincluding a rapidly growing population,\
    \ the depletion of natural resources, environmental pollution,\ncrop diseases,\
    \ and climate change. Precision agriculture is a promising approach to address\
    \ these\nchallenges through improving farming practices, e.g., adaptive inputs\
    \ (e.g., water and fertilizer),\nensured outputs (e.g., crop yield and biomass),\
    \ and reduced environmental impacts. Remote sensing\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659;\

    \ and crops and providing useful information for\nsite-speciﬁc management practices\
    \ [1,2]. There are two types of remote sensing technologies given the\nsource\
    \ of energy, passive (e.g., optical) and active remote sensing (e.g., LiDAR and\
    \ Radar). Passive\noptical remote sensing is usually further divided into two\
    \ groups based on the spectral resolutions\nof sensors, multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing [3]. Multispectral imaging is facilitated\nby collecting spectral\
    \ signals in a few discrete bands, each spanning a broad spectral range from tens\n\
    to hundreds of nanometers. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging detects spectral\
    \ signals in a series of\ncontinuous channels with a narrow spectral bandwidth\
    \ (e.g., typically below 10 nm); therefore, it can\ncapture ﬁne-scale spectral\
    \ features of targets that otherwise could be compromised [4].\nMultispectral\
    \ images (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel 2, and SPOT images) have been widely used in\n\
    agricultural studies to retrieve various crop and soil attributes, such as crop\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nbiomass, yield, and soil degradation [5–10]. However,\
    \ due to the limitations in spectral resolution,\nthe accuracy of the retrieved\
    \ variables is often limited, and early signals of crop stresses (e.g., nutrient\n\
    deﬁciency, crop disease) cannot be eﬀectively detected in a timely manner [11].\n\
    Hyperspectral\nimages (e.g., Hyperion, CASI, and Headwall Micro-Hyperspec) with\
    \ hundreds of bands can capture\nmore detailed spectral responses; hence, it is\
    \ more capable of detecting subtle variations of ground\ncovers and their changes\
    \ over time. Therefore, hyperspectral imagery can be used to address the\naforementioned\
    \ challenges and facilitate more accurate and timely detection of crop physiological\n\
    status [12,13]. Previous studies have also demonstrated the superior performance\
    \ of hyperspectral\nover multispectral images in monitoring vegetation properties,\
    \ such as estimating the leaf area\nindex (LAI) [14], discriminating crop types\
    \ [15], retrieving crop biomass [16], and assessing leaf\nnitrogen content [17].\
    \ Despite its outstanding performance, hyperspectral imaging has been utilized\n\
    comparatively less in operational agricultural applications in the past few decades\
    \ due to the high cost\nof the sensors and imaging missions, and various technical\
    \ challenges (e.g., low signal-to-noise ratio\nand large data volume) [18–21].\
    \ Although ground-based hyperspectral reﬂectance data can be quickly\nmeasured\
    \ using a spectroradiometer (e.g., ASD Field Spec, Analytical Spectral Devices\
    \ Inc., Boulder,\nCO, USA) and have been widely used for observing canopy- and\
    \ leaf-level spectral features [22–24],\nsuch ground-based measurements are limited\
    \ to a few numbers of ﬁeld sites, and they cannot capture\nspatial variability\
    \ across large areas. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging sensors are more convenient\
    \ to\nacquire spatial variability of spectral information across a region.\nIn\
    \ recent years, a wide range of mini-sized and low-cost hyperspectral sensors\
    \ have been developed\nand are available for commercial use, such as Micro- and\
    \ Nano-Hyperspec (Headwall Photonics Inc.,\nBoston, MA, USA), HySpex VNIR (HySpex,\
    \ Skedsmo, Skjetten, Norway), and FireﬂEYE (Cubert GmbH,\nUlm, Germany) [11,25].\
    \ These sensors can be mounted on manned or unmanned airborne platforms\n(e.g.,\
    \ airplanes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) for acquiring hyperspectral\
    \ images\nand supporting various monitoring missions [13,26,27]. In addition,\
    \ new spaceborne hyperspectral\nsensors have been launched recently, such as the\
    \ DESIS—launched in 2018 [28]—and PRISMA—\nlaunched in 2019 [29]—or will be launched\
    \ in the next few years, such as EnMAP, with scheduled\nlaunching in 2020 [30,31].\
    \ Overall, increasingly more airborne or spaceborne hyperspectral images\nhave\
    \ become available, bringing unprecedented opportunities for better monitoring\
    \ of ground targets,\nespecially for better investigation of crop and soil variabilities\
    \ and supporting precision agriculture.\nTherefore, a literature search was performed\
    \ to examine if more research in using hyperspectral\nimaging for agricultural\
    \ purposes had been published in recent years. Both Web of Science and\nGoogle\
    \ Scholar were used for conducting the literature search with topics or keywords,\
    \ including\nhyperspectral, imaging, agriculture, or farming, and publication\
    \ over a 30-year time span (1990 to 2020).\nThe searched results were further\
    \ veriﬁed to ensure that each publication falls within the scope of\nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging for agriculture applications. It was found that there was an increasing\
    \ number\nof publications in recent years that used hyperspectral imaging for\
    \ agricultural applications (Figure 1).\nSubstantially more studies have been\
    \ published in the recent decade (e.g., 245 articles published in\n2011–2020)\
    \ than that in the previous one (e.g., 97 published in 2001–2010).\nRemote Sens.\

    \ \n \n \nFigure 1. The number of publications that utilized hyperspectral imaging\
    \ for agriculture applications \n(by May 2020). \nThis review is designed to focus\
    \ on the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral \nimagery for\
    \ different agricultural applications. The review is organized in the following\
    \ main aspects: \n(1) Hyperspectral imaging platforms and sensors, (2) methods\
    \ for processing and analyzing \nhyperspectral images, and (3) hyperspectral applications\
    \ in agriculture (Table 1). Regarding imaging \nplatforms, different types, including\
    \ satellites, airplanes, helicopters, fixed-wing UAVs, multi-rotor \nUAVs, and\
    \ close-range platforms (e.g., ground or lab based), have been used. These platforms\
    \ acquire \nimages with different spatial coverage, spatial resolution, temporal\
    \ resolution, operational \ncomplexity, and mission cost. It will be beneficial\
    \ to summarize various platforms in terms of these \nfeatures to support the selection\
    \ of the appropriate one(s) for different monitoring purposes. After \nraw hyperspectral\
    \ imagery is acquired, pre-processing is the step for obtaining accurate spectral\
    \ \ninformation. Several procedures need to be carried out during pre-processing\
    \ (usually implemented \nin a specialized remote sensing software), including\
    \ radiometric calibration, spectral correction, \natmospheric correction, and\
    \ geometric correction. Although these are standard processing steps for \nmost\
    \ satellite imagery, it still can be challenging to perform on many airborne hyperspectral\
    \ images \ndue to different technical issues (e.g., the requirement of high-accuracy\
    \ Global Positioning System \n(GPS) signals for proper geometric correction, the\
    \ measurement of real-time solar radiance for \naccurate spectral correction).\
    \ There are no standardized protocols for all sensors due to the limited \navailability\
    \ of hyperspectral imaging in the past and the fact that the new mini-sized and\
    \ low-cost \nhyperspectral sensors in the market are from different manufacturers\
    \ with varying sensor \nconfigurations. Various approaches have been used in previous\
    \ studies to address these challenges \n[12,19,32,33]. Therefore, it is essential\
    \ to review these approaches to support other researchers for \nmore accurate\
    \ and efficient hyperspectral image processing. After pre-preprocessing, such\
    \ as \ncalibration and correction, spectral information extraction (e.g., band\
    \ selection and dimension \nreduction) can be performed to further improve the\
    \ usability of the hyperspectral image. Techniques \nfor these procedures are\
    \ reviewed in this study. \n \nFigure 1. The number of publications that utilized\

    \ to diﬀerent technical\nissues (e.g., the requirement of high-accuracy Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) signals for proper\ngeometric correction, the measurement\
    \ of real-time solar radiance for accurate spectral correction).\nThere are no\
    \ standardized protocols for all sensors due to the limited availability of hyperspectral\n\
    imaging in the past and the fact that the new mini-sized and low-cost hyperspectral\
    \ sensors in the\nmarket are from diﬀerent manufacturers with varying sensor conﬁgurations.\
    \ Various approaches have\nbeen used in previous studies to address these challenges\
    \ [12,19,32,33]. Therefore, it is essential to\nreview these approaches to support\
    \ other researchers for more accurate and eﬃcient hyperspectral\nimage processing.\
    \ After pre-preprocessing, such as calibration and correction, spectral information\n\
    extraction (e.g., band selection and dimension reduction) can be performed to\
    \ further improve the\nusability of the hyperspectral image. Techniques for these\
    \ procedures are reviewed in this study.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n4 of 44\n\

    \ hyperspectral images, a robust and eﬃcient analytical method is required\nfor\
    \ analyzing the tremendous amount of information contained in the images (e.g.,\
    \ spectral, spatial,\nand textural features) and extracting target properties\
    \ (e.g., crop and soil characteristics). Previous\nstudies have used a suite of\
    \ analytical methods, including empirical regression (e.g., linear regression,\n\
    partial least square regression (PLSR), and multi-variable regression (MLR)),\
    \ radiative transfer\nmodelling (RTM, e.g., PROSPECT and PROSAIL), machine learning\
    \ (e.g., random forest (RF)),\nand deep learning (e.g., convolutional neural network\
    \ (CNN)) [34–37]. These methods have been\ndeveloped based on diﬀerent theories\
    \ and have diﬀerent operational complexity, computation eﬃciency,\nand performance\
    \ accuracy. Therefore, it is essential to review the strengths and limitations\
    \ of these\nmethods and help to choose the appropriate one(s) for speciﬁc research\
    \ purposes. Using hyperspectral\ninformation, researchers have investigated a\
    \ wide range of agricultural features. Some popular ones\ninclude crop water content,\
    \ LAI, chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, pests and disease, plant height,\nphenological\
    \ information, soil moisture, and soil organic matter content [11,38]. It will\
    \ also be valuable\nto review the performances of hyperspectral imaging in these\
    \ studies and further explore the potential\nof this technology for monitoring\
    \ other agricultural features. Lastly, challenges of using hyperspectral\nimaging\
    \ for precision agriculture, together with future research directions, are discussed.\
    \ A few\nprevious review articles have discussed some of these topics to some\
    \ extent [11,38,39]. More details\nand contributions of this review will be discussed\
    \ in each speciﬁc section. Overall, this review aims to\nexamine the main procedures\
    \ in collecting and utilizing hyperspectral images for diﬀerent agricultural\n\
    applications, to further understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral\
    \ technology, and to\npromote the faster adoption of this valuable technology\
    \ in precision farming.\n2. Hyperspectral Imaging Platforms and Sensors\nHyperspectral\
    \ sensors can be mounted on different platforms, such as satellites, airplanes,\n\
    UAVs, and close-range platforms, to acquire images with different spatial and\
    \ temporal resolutions.\nPlatforms used in the literature were identified and\
    \ summarized over the publication years, aiming to\nfind, if any, the platforms\
    \ that had been used more frequently in a specific time period, and the results\n\
    are shown in Figure 2. Airplanes have been the most widely used platforms for\
    \ hyperspectral imaging\nin agriculture (Figure 2). Approximately 30 articles\
    \ that used airplanes were published every five years\nstarting from 2001 (e.g.,\
    \ 27 publications in 2001–2005 and 38 in 2006–2010). In comparison, satellite-based\n\
    hyperspectral imaging has been used less frequently; approximately 20 or fewer\
    \ articles were published\nin all five-year periods. UAVs are popular platforms\
    \ for remote sensing and have been widely used in\nthe last decade for hyperspectral\
    \ imaging in agriculture (e.g., more than 20 publications in 2011–2015 and\n2016–2020).\
    \ Close-range platforms have been the most widely used in the last five years\
    \ (i.e., 2016–2020),\nwith 49 publications (Figure 2). The review in this section\
    \ is structured based on different platforms,\nincluding satellites, airplanes,\
    \ UAVs, and close-range platforms. In contrast to previous articles reviewing\n\
    hyperspectral platforms [20,38,39], the review in this section focuses more on\
    \ recent advancements of\nimaging platforms (e.g., UAVs, helicopters, and close\
    \ range) and their applications to precision farming\n(e.g., weed classification,\
    \ fine-scale evaluation of crop health, pests, and disease).\n2.1. Satellite-Based\
    \ Hyperspectral Imaging\nCompared with a large number of satellite-based multispectral\
    \ sensors (e.g., Landsat,\nSPOT, WorldView, QuickBird, Sentinel-2), there are\
    \ signiﬁcantly fewer hyperspectral sensors.\nEO-1 Hyperion, PROBA-CHRIS, and TianGong-1\
    \ [40] are a few examples of the available satellite\nhyperspectral sensors [20].\
    \ EO-1 Hyperion is the most widely used satellite-based hyperspectral\nsensor\
    \ for agriculture (e.g., more than 40 publications). It collects data in the visible,\
    \ near-infrared,\nand shortwave infrared ranges with a spectral resolution of\
    \ 10 nm and a spatial resolution of 30 m.\nMore sensor speciﬁcations of EO-1 Hyperion\
    \ are given in Table 2. The sensor was in operation\nfrom 2000 to 2017, which\
    \ corresponds to the period having more publications using satellite-based\nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging (e.g., 2006 to 2020 in Figure 2). The use of Hyperion data has been\
    \ reported in a\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n6 of 44\nvariety of agricultural\
    \ studies for monitoring diﬀerent crop and soil properties, including detecting\n\
    crop disease [41,42], estimating crop properties (e.g., chlorophyll, LAI, biomass)\
    \ [43–45], assessing crop\nresidues [46,47], classifying crop types [48], and\
    \ investigating soil features [49,50]. A few featured ones\ninclude Wu et al.\
    \ [45], who estimated vegetation chlorophyll content and LAI in a mixed agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld using Hyperion data and evaluated spectral bands that are sensitive to these\
    \ vegetation properties.\nCamacho Velasco et al. [48] used Hyperion hyperspectral\
    \ imagery and diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms\n(e.g., spectral angle mapper\
    \ and adaptive coherence estimator) for identifying ﬁve types of crops\n(e.g.,\
    \ oil palm, rubber, grass for grazing, citrus, and sugar cane) in Colombia. Gomez\
    \ et al. [49] predicted\nsoil organic carbon (SOC) using both spectroradiometer\
    \ data and a Hyperion hyperspectral image,\nand they found that using Hyperion\
    \ data resulted in a lower accuracy compared with results derived\nfrom spectroradiometer\

    \ and the classification of crop types. The authors \nreported better performances\
    \ of using hyperspectral imagery than using Landsat imagery for both \nresearch\

    \ is another commonly used satellite-based hyperspectral sensor that was launched\n\
    in 2001.\nSpeciﬁc studies, such as Verger et al. [57], utilized PROBA-CHRIS data\
    \ for retrieving\nLAI, the fraction of vegetation cover (fCover), and the fraction\
    \ of absorbed photosynthetically\nactive radiation (FAPAR) in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Antony et al. [58] identiﬁed three growth stages\nof wheat using multi-angle\
    \ PROBA-CHRIS images and found the optimal view angles for the\nidentiﬁcation.\
    \ Casa et al. [59] evaluated the performance of airborne Multispectral Infrared\
    \ Visible\nImaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) data and spaceborne PROBA-CHRIS data for\
    \ investigating soil texture,\nand they found that these two data have similar\
    \ performances, although the PROBA-CHRIS data have\na lower spatial resolution.\n\
    There are a few other satellite-based hyperspectral sensors that have not been\
    \ commonly used\nin an agricultural environment. For instance, Hyperspectral Imager\
    \ (HySI) is a hyperspectral sensor\nequipped on the Indian Microsatellite-1 (IMS-1)\
    \ launched in 2008 [60]. It collects spectral signals in the\nrange of 400–950\
    \ nm with a spatial resolution of 550 m at nadir [61]. HySI imagery has been used\
    \ to\nmap diﬀerent agricultural features, such as soil moisture and soil salinity\
    \ [62]. It has also been used for\ncrop classiﬁcation [63]. However, this data\
    \ has not been widely used in precision farming, which is\nprobably due to the\
    \ low spatial resolution and limited data availability. The Hyperspectral Imager\n\
    for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is another spaceborne hyperspectral sensor that takes\
    \ images with a\nspectral range from 380 to 960 nm at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 90 m [64]. This sensor was mainly designed\nto sample the coastal ocean and\
    \ operated from 2009 to 2015.\nIn recent years, several spaceborne hyperspectral\
    \ sensors have been launched or scheduled for\nlaunching in the next few years.\
    \ For instance, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Earth Sensing\nImaging Spectrometer\
    \ (DESIS), a hyperspectral sensor mounted on the International Space Station,\n\
    was launched in 2018 [65]. This sensor acquires images in the range from 400 to\
    \ 1000 nm with a spectral\nresolution of 2.5 nm and a spatial resolution of 30\
    \ m. The Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) is a\nJapanese hyperspectral sensor\
    \ that is also onboard the International Space Station [66]. It was launched\n\
    in 2019 and collects data in the range from 400 to 2500 nm with a spatial resolution\
    \ of 20 m and a\ntemporal resolution of 2 to 60 days [20]. Hyperspectral Precursor\
    \ and Application Mission (PRISMA)\nis an Italian hyperspectral mission with the\
    \ sensor launched in March 2019. Its spectral resolution is\n12 nm in the range\
    \ of 400-2500 nm (~250 bands in visible to shortwave infrared). Its hyperspectral\n\
    imagery has a spatial resolution of 30 and 5 m for the panchromatic band [67].\
    \ The Environmental\nMapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyperspectral\
    \ satellite mission that is still in\nthe development and production phase [68].\
    \ The EnMAP sensor will collect data from the visible to\nthe shortwave infrared\
    \ range with a spatial resolution of 30 m. It is planned to be launched in 2020.\n\
    The Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission (SHALOM) is a\
    \ joint mission by\nIsraeli and Italian space agencies, and the satellite is scheduled\
    \ to be launched in 2022 [69]. This sensor\nwill collect hyperspectral images\
    \ with a spatial resolution of 10 m in the spectral range of 400–2500 nm\nand\
    \ panchromatic images with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m [70]. HyspIRI is another\
    \ hyperspectral\nmission that is also at the study stage [71]. This sensor will\
    \ collect data in the 380 to 2500 nm range\nwith an interval of 10 nm and a spatial\
    \ resolution of 60 m.\nAlthough the actual PRISMA, EnMAP, and HyspIRI data are\
    \ not yet available, researchers\nhave simulated the images using other data and\
    \ tested the performance of the simulated images for\ninvestigating diﬀerent vegetation\
    \ and soil features. For instance, Malec et al. [72], Siegmann et al. [73],\n\
    and Locherer et al. [74] simulated EnMAP imagery using diﬀerent airborne or spaceborne\
    \ images and\napplied the simulated images for investigating diﬀerent crop and\
    \ soil properties. Bachmann et al. [75]\nproduced an image using the EnMAP’s end-to-end\
    \ simulation tool and examined the uncertainties\nassociated with spectral and\
    \ radiometric calibration. Castaldi et al. [76] simulated data of four\ncurrent\
    \ (EO-1 ALI and Hyperion, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2\
    \ MultiSpectral\nInstrument (MSI)) and three forthcoming (EnMAP, PRISMA, and HyspIRI)\
    \ sensors using a soil spectral\nlibrary and compared their performance for estimating\
    \ soil properties. Castaldi et al. [77] used PRISMA\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\
    9 of 44\ndata that were simulated with lab-measured spectral data for estimating\
    \ clay content and attempted to\nreduce the inﬂuence of soil moisture on the estimation\
    \ of clay.\nPrevious studies have conﬁrmed the good performance of satellite-based\
    \ hyperspectral sensors for\nstudying agricultural features; however, several\
    \ factors could potentially aﬀect the broad applications\nof these data in precision\
    \ farming, including the spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and data quality.\n\
    The detection and monitoring of many agricultural features, such as crop disease,\
    \ pest infestation,\nand nutrient status, require high spatial and temporal resolution.\n\
    Most of the satellite-based\nhyperspectral sensors have medium spatial resolutions,\
    \ such as 17 or 36 m for PROBA-CHRIS;\n30 m for Hyperion, PRISMA, and EnMAP, DESIS;\
    \ and 60 m for HyspIRI. Previous studies have\nindicated that such spatial resolutions\
    \ are not suﬃcient for precision farming applications [20,49].\nTo overcome such\
    \ limitations, researchers have attempted to pansharpen hyperspectral images,\
    \ aiming\nto improve spatial resolution [73,78–80]. Loncan et al. [81] also reviewed\
    \ diﬀerent pansharpening\nmethods for generating high-spatial resolution hyperspectral\
    \ images.\nTemporal resolution is another factor that could potentially limit\
    \ the applications of satellite-based\nhyperspectral images to precision agriculture.\
    \ Most of the satellite-based sensors have a long revisit\ncycle (e.g., typically\
    \ around two weeks), and thus early signals of crop stress (e.g., disease and\n\
    pest) may be missed. This limitation can be further aggravated by unfavorable\
    \ weather conditions\n(e.g., cloud contamination). Lastly, low data quality is\
    \ also an issue that can aﬀect the performance of\nsatellite-based hyperspectral\
    \ imaging for investigating agricultural features. A low signal-to-noise ratio\n\
    is a well-known issue of Hyperion data (e.g., in the shortwave infrared (SWIR)\
    \ range), which has aﬀected\nthe accuracy of retrieving diﬀerent agricultural\
    \ features [20]. For instance, Asner and Heidebrecht [82],\nGomez et al. [49],\
    \ and Weng et al. [83] found that the low signal-to-noise ratio inﬂuenced the\
    \ accuracies\nof estimating non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil cover, soil\
    \ organic matter, and soil salinity,\nrespectively. Future satellite-based hyperspectral\
    \ missions are expected to solve the data quality issue.\n2.2. Airplane-Based\
    \ Hyperspectral Imaging\nAirborne hyperspectral imaging has been widely used to\
    \ collect hyperspectral imagery for\ndiﬀerent monitoring purposes (e.g., for agriculture\
    \ or forestry). The ﬁrst hyperspectral sensor was an\nairborne visible/infrared\
    \ imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) that was developed and utilized in 1987 [84].\n\
    It collects spectral signals in 224 bands in the visible to SWIR range (Table\
    \ 2). Researchers have applied\nAVIRIS data to help understand a wide range of\
    \ agricultural features, such as investigating vegetation\nproperties (e.g., yield,\
    \ LAI, chlorophyll, and water content) [85–88], analyzing soil properties [89],\n\
    evaluating crop health or identifying pest infestation [90–92], and mapping crop\
    \ area or agricultural\ntillage practices [93,94].\nBesides AVIRIS, the Compact\
    \ Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), Hyperspectral Mapper\n(HyMap), and AISA\
    \ Eagle are also widely used airborne hyperspectral sensors (Table 2). For instance,\n\
    CASI images have been used for estimating crop chlorophyll content [95], investigating\
    \ crop cover\nfraction [96], classifying weeds [97], and delineating management\
    \ zones [2]. The HyMap imagery\nhas been applied to examining crop biophysical\
    \ and biochemical variables (e.g., LAI, chlorophyll and\nwater content) [98–100],\
    \ detecting plant stress signals [101], and investigating the spatial patterns\
    \ of\nSOC [102]. Regarding AISA Eagle imagery, Ryu et al. [35] and Cilia et al.\
    \ [103] used this data for\nestimating crop nitrogen content, and Ambrus et al.\
    \ [104] used it for estimating biomass.\nSeveral other airborne hyperspectral\
    \ sensors have also been used in previous studies. For instance,\nAVIS images\
    \ were used for investigating a range of vegetation characteristics (e.g., biomass\
    \ and\nchlorophyll) [105], Probe-1 hyperspectral images were used for investigating\
    \ crop residues [106],\nRDACS-H4 hyperspectral images were used for detecting\
    \ crop disease [34], AHS-160 hyperspectral\nsensor was used for mapping SOC [107],\
    \ the SWIR Hyper Spectral Imaging (HSI) sensor was used for\nestimating soil moisture\
    \ [108], the Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI) was used for estimating\nwinter\
    \ wheat LAI [109], and airborne prism experiment (APEX) data were used for studying\
    \ the\nrelationship between SOC in croplands and the spectral signals [110].\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n10 of 44\nMost of the aforementioned airborne hyperspectral\
    \ images have been acquired by airplanes at\nmedium to high altitude (e.g., 1–4\
    \ km altitude for CASI, 20 km for AVIRIS), and the acquired images\ngenerally\
    \ having high to medium spatial resolution, such as 4 m for CASI imagery, 5 m\
    \ for HyMap,\nand 20 m for AVIRIS [111–113]. Such spatial resolutions are appropriate\
    \ for mapping many crop and\nsoil features. However, image acquisition usually\
    \ needs to be scheduled months or even years in\nadvance, and ﬂight missions are\
    \ expensive [19]. Furthermore, for some speciﬁc applications, such as\ninvestigating\
    \ species-level or community-level features (e.g., identiﬁcation of weeds or early\
    \ signal\nof crop disease), images with very high spatial resolutions (e.g., sub-meter)\
    \ are preferred [114,115].\nIn addition, due to the unstable nature of airplanes\
    \ as imaging platforms, a gimbal or high-accuracy\ninertial measurement unit (IMU)\
    \ will be required to compensate for the orientation change of the\nairplanes\
    \ or recording the orientation information for subsequent image correction, respectively.\n\
    These factors limited the full application of airborne hyperspectral imaging in\
    \ precision agriculture.\nManned helicopters have also been used as platforms\
    \ for hyperspectral imaging and investigation\nof vegetation features [27,116].\

    \ Such spatial resolutions are appropriate for mapping many crop and \nsoil features.\
    \ However, image acquisition usually needs to be scheduled months or even years\
    \ in \nadvance, and flight missions are expensive [19]. Furthermore, for some\
    \ specific applications, such as \ninvestigating species-level or community-level\
    \ features (e.g., identification of weeds or early signal \nof crop disease),\
    \ images with very high spatial resolutions (e.g., sub-meter) are preferred [114,115].\
    \ \nIn addition, due to the unstable nature of airplanes as imaging platforms,\
    \ a gimbal or high-accuracy \ninertial measurement unit (IMU) will be required\
    \ to compensate for the orientation change of the \nairplanes or recording the\
    \ orientation information for subsequent image correction, respectively. \nThese\
    \ factors limited the full application of airborne hyperspectral imaging in precision\
    \ agriculture. \nManned helicopters have also been used as platforms for hyperspectral\
    \ imaging and investigation of \nvegetation features [27,116]. Helicopters have\
    \ more flexible flight heights (e.g., 100 m–2 km) than \nairplanes and are capable\
    \ of acquiring high-spatial-resolution images (e.g., sub-meter) over large \n\

    \ lightweight hyperspectral sensors have been developed in recent years and can\
    \ be\nmounted on UAVs. Examples of sensors include the widely-used Headwall Micro-\
    \ and Nano-Hyperspec\nVNIR [12,13,26,128], UHD 185-Fireﬂy [53,130], the PIKA II\
    \ sensor [19,32], and the HySpex VNIR [25,131].\nThese hyperspectral sensors contain\
    \ more than 100 bands in the visible-near infrared spectral range\n(Table 2).\
    \ These sensors are small and compact (1–2 kg), thus they can be deployed quickly\
    \ on various\nmanned or unmanned remote sensing platforms. Previous studies conducted\
    \ by Adão et al. [11] and\nLodhi et al. [52] also compared and summarized various\
    \ lightweight hyperspectral sensors.\nA large number of factors need to be considered\
    \ in the application of UAV-based hyperspectral\nimaging, ranging from sensor\
    \ setup and data collection, to image processing. Saari et al. [122] tested\n\
    the feasibility of a UAV-based hyperspectral imaging system for agricultural and\
    \ forest applications\nand discussed several challenges regarding the imaging\
    \ technology (e.g., hardware requirements\nand system settings).\nAasen et al.\
    \ [132] focused on the calibration of images collected with a\nframe-based sensor\
    \ and discussed several challenges related to the use of UAV-based hyperspectral\n\
    imaging for vegetation and crop investigation (e.g., the payload of UAV, signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio, and\nspectral calibration). Habib et al. [120] attempted to perform orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ of UAV-acquired\npushbroom-based hyperspectral imagery with frame-based RGB\
    \ images over an agricultural ﬁeld.\nAdão et al. [11] reviewed applications of\
    \ UAV-based hyperspectral imaging in agriculture and forestry\nand listed several\
    \ hyperspectral sensors that can be mounted on UAVs. The authors also discussed\n\
    several challenges in collecting and analyzing UAV-based hyperspectral imagery,\
    \ such as radiometric\nnoise, the low quality of UAV georeferencing, and a low\
    \ signal-to-noise ratio.\nUAV-based hyperspectral imaging has become more popular\
    \ in recent years; therefore, it is critical to\nreview its strengths and limitations.\
    \ To explore more features of this technology, this section of the review\nis\
    \ not limited to agricultural applications alone. Different types of UAVs have\
    \ been used as hyperspectral\nimaging platforms, with the two most widely used\
    \ as multi-rotors [130,133,134] and ﬁxed-wing\nplanes [33,120,135]. Slow ﬂights\
    \ at low altitudes are preferred to achieve high-spatial-resolution\nhyperspectral\
    \ imagery with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, a multi-rotor is more competitive\
    \ than\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n12 of 44\nﬁxed-wing planes for hyperspectral\
    \ imaging in terms of ﬂight operation. Speciﬁcally, the multi-rotor\nallows for\
    \ a low ﬂight altitude, ﬂexible ﬂight speed, and vertical takeoﬀ and landing,\
    \ while the\nﬁxed wing requires a minimum ﬂight altitude, speed, and, sometimes,\
    \ accessories for takeoﬀ and\nlanding (e.g., runway, launcher, and parachute).\
    \ A hyperspectral imaging system, which consists\nof a hyperspectral sensor, a\
    \ data processing unit, a GPS, and an IMU, has a considerable weight\n(e.g., 1–3\
    \ kg), thus bringing challenges to the payload capacity of the UAV system and\
    \ its battery\nendurance. The multi-rotors are generally powered by high-performance\
    \ batteries (e.g., LiPo), and most\nhave a short endurance (e.g., less than 20\
    \ min). The endurance can be as short as 3 min [12]. In contrast,\nmany ﬁxed-wing\
    \ UAVs are powered by fuel, thus having a much longer endurance (e.g., 1–10 h)\
    \ [19,135].\nHowever, these ﬁxed-wing planes are mostly large and heavy (e.g.,\
    \ a 5 m wingspan and 14 kg take-oﬀ\nweight) [135], and thus bring challenges to\
    \ the ﬂight operation. Using UAV, researchers need to consider\nthe UAV SWaP (size,\
    \ weight, and power), geographical coverage, time aloft, altitude, and other variables.\n\
    In addition to the challenges in building a UAV system and performing ﬂight operations,\
    \ researchers\nlikely need to apply for ﬂight permission from an aviation authority\
    \ (e.g., Special Flight Operations\nCertiﬁcate (SFOC) from Transport Canada),\
    \ and purchase suitable UAV ﬂight insurance [136]. UAV size\nand weight are essential\
    \ parameters to consider in these processes. Furthermore, the UAVs are required\n\
    to be visible during ﬂight missions, so that the pilot can maintain constant visual\
    \ contact with the\naircraft. This could create a major challenge when ﬂying over\
    \ a large area, a hilly area, or an area\nwith forests.\n2.4. Close-Range (Ground-\
    \ or Lab-Based) Hyperspectral Imaging\nClose-range hyperspectral imaging, including\
    \ ground (Figure 4a–c) or lab based (Figure 4d,e),\nis an emerging technology\
    \ in recent years, and it is capable of acquiring super-high-spatial-resolution\n\
    (e.g., cm or sub-cm level) hyperspectral imagery [137–139]. Therefore, this imaging\
    \ technology can\nbe used for investigating ﬁne-scale (e.g., leaf and canopy level)\
    \ vegetation features and thus greatly\nsupport the investigation of crop growing\
    \ status and detection of early signs of crop stress (e.g., disease,\nweeds, or\
    \ nutrition deﬁciency). Sensors are mounted on moving or static platforms (e.g.,\
    \ linear\nstages, scaﬀolds, or trucks) that can be deployed indoors or outdoors\
    \ for collecting images. Lamps\n(e.g., halogen lamp) or the sun are used as light\
    \ sources in these platforms, respectively.\nResearchers have utilized diﬀerent\
    \ types of platforms and hyperspectral sensors for collecting\nsuper-high-spatial-resolution\
    \ hyperspectral imagery to study diﬀerent agricultural features, as shown\nin\

    \ for Processing and Analyzing Hyperspectral Images\nHyperspectral images acquired\
    \ by diﬀerent platforms and sensors are typically provided in a\nraw format (e.g.,\
    \ digital numbers) that needs to be pre-processed (e.g., atmospheric, radiometric,\n\
    and spectral corrections) to retrieve accurate spectral information. Afterward,\
    \ diﬀerent approaches can\nbe used for analyzing the hyperspectral information\
    \ and investigating various agricultural features\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\
    15 of 44\n(e.g., crop and soil properties). A few commonly used methods include\
    \ linear regression, advanced\nregression (e.g., PLSR), machine learning and deep\
    \ learning (e.g., RF, CNN), and radiative transfer\nmodelling (e.g., PROSPECT\
    \ and PROSAIL). Researchers have used one or more of these methods for\ninvestigations\
    \ of diﬀerent agricultural features. In this section, the review is arranged based\
    \ on the\ndiﬀerent methods used in the studies.\n3.1. Pre-Processing of Hyperspectral\
    \ Images\nTypical processing of hyperspectral imagery includes geometric correction,\
    \ orthorectiﬁcation,\nradiometric correction, and atmospheric correction. For\
    \ satellite- and airplane-based hyperspectral\nimages, the geometric and orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ correction are generally performed by data providers,\nand the radiometric and\
    \ atmospheric corrections can be done following standard image processing steps\n\
    available in remote sensing software. For UAV-based images, in contrast, the users\
    \ need to conduct\nthese processing steps and decide on appropriate processing\
    \ methods and associated parameters.\nFor instance, a digital elevation model\
    \ (DEM) and ground control points (GCPs) are usually needed\nfor performing the\
    \ orthorectiﬁcation and geometric correction [12]. If the sensor mounted on UAV\n\
    is pushbroom based, accurate sensor orientation information recorded by an IMU\
    \ will be needed\nfor these corrections, and the IMU needs to be integrated into\
    \ the UAV and well-calibrated [12,27].\nSoftware packages commonly used in previous\
    \ studies for performing these corrections on UAV-based\nhyperspectral images\
    \ include ENVI (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA) and\nPARGE\
    \ (ReSe Applications Schläpfer, Wil, Switzerland) [12,26,117].\nRadiometric correction\
    \ is conducted to convert image digital numbers to radiance using calibration\n\
    coeﬃcients that are provided by the sensor manufacturer [11]. These coeﬃcients\
    \ may need to be updated\nover time due to the degradation of spectral materials\
    \ used to construct the hyperspectral sensors.\nRegarding atmospheric correction,\
    \ although the UAVs are ﬂown at low altitudes, the signals acquired\nare still\
    \ subjective to the inﬂuence of various atmospheric absorptions and scatterings,\
    \ such as oxygen\nabsorption at 760nm; water absorption near 820, 940, 1140, 1380,\
    \ and 1880 nm; and carbon dioxide\nabsorption at 2010 and 2060 nm [12,13,26,150].\
    \ Therefore, atmospheric correction is critical for obtaining\ngood-quality spectral\
    \ information. However, Adão et al. [11] suggest that this process might be skipped\n\
    if the UAVs are operated close to the ground. Therefore, the application of atmospheric\
    \ correction will\ndepend on speciﬁc ﬂight missions and research purposes (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂight altitudes, if atmosphere-inﬂuenced\nspectral bands are needed). Software\
    \ or methods commonly used in previous studies for performing\natmospheric correction\
    \ on UAV-based hyperspectral images include the MODTRAN model (Spectral\nSciences\
    \ Inc.), ENVI FLAASH (L3Harris Geospatial), PCI Geomatica (PCI Geomatics Corporate),\n\
    SMARTS model (Solar Consulting Services), and empirical line correction [12,19,27,32,33,116].\n\
    Hyperspectral images typically have hundreds of bands, and many of them are highly\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, dimension reduction is also an essential procedure to\
    \ consider in the pre-processing of\nhyperspectral imagery. Many previous studies\
    \ using hyperspectral imagery have discussed the\nchallenges of data redundancy\
    \ and have used diﬀerent methods for dimension reduction. For instance,\nMiglani\
    \ et al. [151] performed principal component analysis (PCA) on hyperspectral images\
    \ and\nindicated that 99% of the information could be explained in the ﬁrst 10\
    \ principal components.\nAmato et al. [152] discussed a few previous methods of\
    \ dimension reduction, such as PCA, minimum\nnoise fraction (MNF), and singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD), and proposed a dimension reduction\nalgorithm based\
    \ on discriminant analysis for supervised classiﬁcation. Teke et al. [38] reviewed\n\
    several dimension reduction methods and summarized them based on transformation\
    \ techniques.\nThenkabail et al. [153] discussed the problems of high dimensionality\
    \ and listed a number of spectral\nbands that are more important for investigating\
    \ crop features. Sahoo et al. [4] reviewed diﬀerent\nmethods for dimension reduction,\
    \ such as PCA, uniform feature design (UMD), wavelet transforms,\nand artiﬁcial\
    \ neural networks (ANNs), and discussed their features of operation. Wang et al.\
    \ [154]\nproposed an auto-encoder-based dimensionality reduction method that is\
    \ a deep learning-based\napproach. Of these diﬀerent methods, the wavelet transform\
    \ is one of the most widely used ones for\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n16 of\
    \ 44\ndimension reduction. This technique decomposes a signal into a series of\
    \ scaled versions of the mother\nwavelet function and allows the variation of\
    \ the wavelet based on the frequency information to extract\nlocalized features\
    \ (e.g., local spectral variation) [155,156]. It has also been successfully used\
    \ for image\nfusion, feature extraction, and image classiﬁcation [156–158].\n\
    In addition to dimensionality reduction, band sensitivity analysis and band selection\
    \ have also\nbeen widely used in hyperspectral remote sensing to reduce the data\
    \ size by selecting only the bands\nthat are sensitive to the object of interest.\
    \ Diﬀerent algorithms have been proposed in previous studies\nfor band selection,\
    \ such as a fast volume-gradient-based method that is an unsupervised method and\n\
    removes the most redundant band successively based on the gradient of volume [159],\
    \ a column subset\nselection-based method that maximizes the volume of the selected\
    \ subset of columns (i.e., bands)\nand is robust to noisy bands [160], and a manifold\
    \ ranking-based salient band selection method that\nputs band vectors in manifold\
    \ space and selects a band-based ranking that can tackle the problem of\ninappropriate\
    \ measurement of the band diﬀerence [161]. With the sensitivity analysis, previous\
    \ studies\nhave identiﬁed spectral bands that are sensitive to diﬀerent crop properties,\
    \ for instance, ~515, ~550,\n~570, ~670, 700–740, ~800, and ~855 nm for investigating\
    \ chlorophyll content; ~405, ~515, ~570, ~705,\nand ~720 nm for evaluating nitrogen\
    \ status; ~970, ~1180, ~1245, ~1450, and ~1950 nm for assessing\nwater content;\
    \ ~682, ~855, ~910, ~970, ~1075, ~1245, ~1518, ~1725, and ~2260 nm for estimating\n\
    biomass; and ~550, ~682, ~855, ~1075, ~1180, ~1450, and ~1725 nm for crop classiﬁcation\
    \ [36,44,153,162].\nOverall, pre-processing is an essential step for improving\
    \ the quality of hyperspectral images and\npreparing for further data analysis.\
    \ After the pre-processing, the analytical methods to be discussed\nbelow can\
    \ be used for analyzing the hyperspectral information and investigating various\
    \ agricultural\nfeatures on the ground.\n3.2. Empirical Relationships\nLinear\
    \ regression is a widely used method for analyzing hyperspectral imagery and retrieving\n\
    target information (e.g., crop and soil properties). Both spectral reﬂectance\
    \ and vegetation indices can\nbe used as predictor variables in establishing a\
    \ linear relationship. For instance, using spectral bands,\nFinn et al. [108]\
    \ built linear regressions between ﬁeld-measured soil moisture data and the spectral\n\
    reﬂectance of collected hyperspectral imagery and identiﬁed bands that have stronger\
    \ correlations with\nsoil moisture. More studies have used vegetation indices\
    \ in the regression for a better performance as\nsome indices can enhance the\
    \ signal of targeted features and minimize the background noise. Some of\nthe\
    \ previous studies are shown in Table 6.\nTable 6. Selected previous studies utilized\
    \ linear regression and hyperspectral vegetation indices for\ninvestigating agricultural\
    \ features.\nApplications\nPrevious Studies\nResearch Focuses\nEstimating leaf\n\

    \ et al. [44]\nUtilized both spectral bands and vegetation indices for\nclassifying\
    \ diﬀerent crop types and estimating vegetation\nproperties and evaluated the\
    \ performance diﬀerence of using\nvarious bands or indices.\nOverall, linear regression\
    \ has been commonly used for estimating a wide range of crop or soil\nproperties.\
    \ It is easy to establish, and most of the index-based regressions generated satisfactory\n\
    accuracies. However, there are several potential issues associated with this approach,\
    \ such as the large\nnumber of indices available and it is unknown which performs\
    \ better, regression may be very sensitive\nto data size and quality, and the\
    \ saturation problem of indices [36,165]. It is thus critical to consider\nthese\
    \ potential issues and adopt appropriate solutions when establishing linear regressions\
    \ with\nhyperspectral data. For instance, selecting appropriate vegetation indices\
    \ with targeted crop or soil\nvariables is recommended. Researchers have evaluated\
    \ a wide range of hyperspectral vegetation indices\nfor diﬀerent research purposes.\
    \ Haboudane et al. [166] examined 11 hyperspectral vegetation indices for\nestimating\
    \ crop chlorophyll content. Main et al. [167] investigated 73 vegetation indices\
    \ for estimating\nchlorophyll content in crop and savanna tree species. Peng and\
    \ Gitelson [168] tested 10 multispectral\nindices and 4 hyperspectral indices\
    \ for quantifying crop gross primary productivity. Croft et al. [169]\nanalyzed\
    \ 47 hyperspectral indices for estimating the leaf chlorophyll content of diﬀerent\
    \ tree species.\nZhou et al. [170] evaluated eight hyperspectral indices for estimating\
    \ the canopy-level wheat nitrogen\ncontent. Tong and He [165] evaluated 21 multispectral\
    \ and 123 hyperspectral vegetation indices for\ncalculating the grass chlorophyll\
    \ content at both the leaf and canopy scales. Yue et al. [171] examined\n54 hyperspectral\
    \ vegetation indices for estimating winter wheat biomass. Indices performed diﬀerently\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n18 of 44\nin these studies; thus, it is suggested\
    \ to evaluate the top-performed ones in these studies and select the\none that\
    \ generates the highest accuracy.\nTo deal with issues of linear regression, advanced\
    \ regression, such as MLR and PLSR, has also\nbeen commonly used in previous research\
    \ for estimating crop and soil properties [172,173]. Compared\nwith linear regression,\
    \ the advanced regression models mostly use multiple predictor variables in the\n\
    model to achieve a higher accuracy. PLSR is one of the most widely used models\
    \ for investigating\ncrop properties using hyperspectral images, such as Ryu et\
    \ al. [35], Jarmer [99], Siegmann et al. [73],\nand Yue et al. [124] used PLSR\
    \ and hyperspectral images for estimating diﬀerent crop biophysical and\nbiochemical\
    \ variables (e.g., LAI, biomass, chlorophyll, content, fresh matter, and nitrogen\
    \ contents).\nThomas et al. [100] examined PLSR for retrieving the biogas potential\
    \ from hyperspectral images and\nevaluated the inﬂuence of imaging time on retrieval\
    \ accuracy. Regarding soil features, Gomez et al. [49],\nVan Wesemael et al. [107],\
    \ Hbirkou et al. [102], and Castaldi et al. [110] built a PLSR model for estimating\n\
    the SOC content using hyperspectral images. Zhang et al. [50] used PLSR for estimating\
    \ a wide range\nof soil properties (e.g., soil moisture, soil organic matter,\
    \ clay, total carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen\ncontent) from hyperspectral imagery\
    \ and identiﬁed factors that may aﬀect the model accuracy\n(e.g., low signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio, spectral overlap of diﬀerent soil features). Casa et al. [59] used the\n\
    PLSR model and diﬀerent hyperspectral imagery for investigating soil textural\
    \ features and evaluated\nvarious factors (e.g., spectral range and resolution,\
    \ soil moisture, geolocation error) inﬂuencing the\nmodel performance.\nThe PLSR\
    \ model is implemented in Python and R [174,175] and is widely used in many research\n\
    areas, including forests [176], grasslands [177], and waters [178]. This model\
    \ performed well in diﬀerent\nstudies owning to its strengths in dealing with\
    \ a large number of inter-correlated predictor variables\n(i.e., by converting\
    \ them to a few non-correlated latent variables), addressing the data noise challenge,\n\
    and tackling the over-ﬁtting problem [171,179]. Diﬀerent techniques have also\
    \ been conﬁrmed to\nbe eﬃcient for improving the accuracy of the PLSR model, such\
    \ as incorporating diﬀerent types of\npredictor variables in the model (e.g.,\
    \ spectral bands, indices, textural variables), utilizing predicted\nresidual\
    \ error sum of squares (PRESS) statistics for determining the optimal number of\
    \ latent variables,\nand feature evaluation for selecting more important predictor\
    \ variables in the model [36]. It is thus\ncritical to carefully examine these\
    \ techniques for achieving the optimal model accuracy.\n3.3. Radiative Transfer\
    \ Modelling\nRadiative transfer modelling is a physically based approach that\
    \ uses physical laws to\nsimulate the interaction of electromagnetic radiation\
    \ with vegetation (e.g., reﬂection, transmission,\nand absorption) [180]. The\
    \ RTMs simulate vegetation spectra (e.g., leaf reﬂectance and transmittance)\n\
    using vegetation biophysical and biochemical properties (e.g., chlorophyll and\
    \ water contents) in\nthe forward mode, and for inversion of these variables from\
    \ spectral measurements in the inverse\nmode [181]. PROSAIL is one of the most\
    \ widely used RTMs. This model is an integration of the\nleaf-level PROSPECT model\
    \ and canopy-level SAIL model and is capable of simulating canopy\nreﬂectance\
    \ using leaf properties (e.g., chlorophyll and water contents), canopy structural\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., LAI and leaf angle), and soil reﬂectance [18].\nPROSAIL has\
    \ also been used in agricultural environments for investigating crop and soil\n\
    properties. For instance, Casa and Jones [182] inverted PROSAIL and a ray-tracing\
    \ canopy model\nwith spectroradiometer-measured hyperspectral reﬂectance data\
    \ and imaging spectrometer-acquired\nhyperspectral image data, respectively, for\
    \ estimating canopy LAI and evaluated factors inﬂuencing\nthe estimation accuracy\
    \ (e.g., the non-homogeneous surface caused by the crop row structure).\nRichter\
    \ et al. [98] utilized PROSAIL for estimating LAI, fCover, canopy chlorophyll,\
    \ and water content\nfrom hyperspectral images and compared its performance to\
    \ other methods (e.g., artiﬁcial neural\nnetwork). Richter et al. [183] applied\
    \ PROSAIL to investigate similar vegetation variables and analyzed\nthe accuracy\
    \ and eﬃciency of this method. Wu et al. [184] examined the sensitivity of vegetation\
    \ indices\nto vegetation chlorophyll content using simulated results from the\
    \ PROSPECT model and suggested\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n19 of 44\na few well-performed\
    \ indices. Locherer et al. [74] attempted to estimate vegetation LAI using the\n\
    PROSAIL model and multi-source hyperspectral images and tested several techniques\
    \ (e.g., diﬀerent\ncost functions and types of averaging methods) used for the\
    \ inversion process. Yu et al. [37] estimated\na range of vegetation phenotyping\
    \ variables (e.g., LAI and leaf chlorophyll) using hyperspectral\nimagery and\
    \ PROSAIL and examined the sensitivity of diﬀerent spectral ranges to the parameters\
    \ in\nthe PROSAIL model.\nCompared with the regression models discussed in previous\
    \ sections, the RTMs have been less\nused in the literature for investigating\
    \ agricultural features due mainly to their high model complexity\nand computational\
    \ intensity. For instance, a wide range of parameters need to be considered in\n\
    RTM (e.g., chlorophyll, carotenoids, water contents, leaf area index, leaf angles,\
    \ solar angles, and soil\nreﬂectance, along with other parameters, in the PROSAIL\
    \ model) and the users need to use diﬀerent\ntechniques (e.g., merit function,\
    \ look-up table) to facilitate the forward and inversion operations of\nthe model.\
    \ In addition, it costs much more computing time than the regression models to\
    \ achieve the\npredictions of target vegetation variables. However, it is also\
    \ well known that the regression models\ntend to be site and time speciﬁc and\
    \ are not readily transferable to other geographical regions or\ndiﬀerent times\
    \ over the site [166]. In contrast, RTM is a more transferable approach owning\
    \ to the\nfact that it is established based on physical laws and does not require\
    \ training data for rebuilding\nthe model. In addition, RTM is capable of estimating\
    \ a range of vegetation properties in one model,\nwhile regression models typically\
    \ can only estimate one variable [36,185].\n3.4. Machine Learning and Deep Learning\n\
    Machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine regression (SVM)\
    \ and RF,\nare powerful tools for analyzing hyperspectral information since they\
    \ can process a large number of\nvariables (e.g., spectral reﬂectance and vegetation\
    \ indices) eﬃciently [186]. Machine learning has been\nwidely used in the remote\
    \ sensing ﬁeld for estimating properties of ground features or classifying\ndiﬀerent\
    \ ground covers [36,114,187]. Researchers have also used diﬀerent machine learning\
    \ algorithms\nand hyperspectral images for agricultural applications. SVM has\
    \ been a commonly used algorithm\nin previous research for prediction or classiﬁcation\
    \ purposes. For instance, Honkavaara et al. [123]\nestimated crop biomass using\
    \ SVM and UAV-acquired hyperspectral imagery. Bostan et al. [51] utilized\nSVM\
    \ for classifying diﬀerent crop types and achieved high classiﬁcation accuracy.\
    \ Ran et al. [93]\nused KNN and SVM classiﬁers for investigating tillage practices\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds and compared\ntheir performances. RF is another commonly\
    \ used algorithm for investigating agricultural features\nwith hyperspectral imagery.\
    \ For instance, Gao et al. [188] successfully classiﬁed weed and maize\nusing\
    \ RF and lab-based hyperspectral images. Using ground-based hyperspectral reﬂectance\
    \ data\nacquired by an ASD spectroradiometer, Siegmann and Jarmer [189] evaluated\
    \ the performance of\nRF, SVM, and PLSR for estimating crop LAI and conﬁrmed the\
    \ good performance of RF. Similarly,\nusing hyperspectral reﬂectance, Adam et\
    \ al. [190] attempted to detect maize disease with the RF model.\nOverall, machine\
    \ learning models generally have robust performances for investigating agricultural\n\
    features using hyperspectral imagery.\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning\
    \ and extends machine learning by adding more\n“depth” (i.e., hierarchical representation\
    \ of the dataset) in the model [191,192]. It is a popular approach\nin recent\
    \ years for recognizing patterns in remote sensing images and thus for investigating\
    \ various\nground features. Deep learning has been commonly used in the remote\
    \ sensing ﬁeld for image\nclassiﬁcation, such as land cover classiﬁcation [193–195]\
    \ and the identiﬁcation of ground features\n(e.g., buildings) [196]. Deep learning\
    \ has also been applied to precision farming to solve complicated\nissues. Existing\
    \ studies are, for example, investigating the estimation of crop yield using CNN\n\
    and multispectral images together with climate data [197], plant disease detection\
    \ using CNN and\nsmartphone-acquired images [198], crop classiﬁcation using 3-D\
    \ CNN and multi-temporal multispectral\nimages [199], and classiﬁcation of agricultural\
    \ land cover using deep recurrent neural network and\nmulti-temporal SAR images\
    \ [200]. Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú [191] reviewed applications of deep\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n20 of 44\nlearning in agriculture and food production,\
    \ although not all studies used remote sensing images.\nSingh et al. [201] reviewed\
    \ a range of deep learning methods and their applications, speciﬁcally in plant\n\
    phenotyping. Up to now, deep learning has not been well explored for processing\
    \ and analyzing remote\nsensing images, especially hyperspectral images, for agricultural\
    \ applications. Considering the capacity\nof deep learning for studying feature\
    \ patterns in images and the rich information in hyperspectral\nimagery, the integration\
    \ of the two has a wide range of agricultural applications (e.g., crop classiﬁcation,\n\
    weed monitoring, crop disease detection, and plant stress evaluation). Further\
    \ research in these areas\nis warranted.\nMachine learning or deep learning is\
    \ capable of processing multi-source and multi-type data [202].\nFor instance,\
    \ besides multi-type remote sensing images (e.g., optical, thermal, LiDAR, and\
    \ Radar), other\nsources of data, such as weather, irrigation, and historical\
    \ yield information, can also be incorporated in\nthe modelling process for a\
    \ possibly better evaluation of targeted agricultural features [203]. Although\n\
    machine learning and deep learning models are powerful, it is also critical to\
    \ keep in mind that these\nmodels require large-quantity and high-quality training\
    \ samples to achieve robust performances [202].\nInsuﬃcient training datasets\
    \ or data with issues (e.g., data incompleteness, noise, and biases) may\ncause\
    \ undesired model performances.\nIn summary, diﬀerent analytical methods (e.g.,\
    \ linear regression, advanced regression,\nmachine learning and deep learning,\
    \ and RTM) have diﬀerent levels of complexity, performance,\nand transferability.\
    \ More detailed comparisons on these methods are listed in Table 7. Overall, linear\n\
    regression is the easiest method to use, and its performance is generally acceptable,\
    \ although this\nmethod can be highly inﬂuenced by the choice of predictor variables\
    \ and quality of the sample data.\nThe advanced regression (e.g., PLSR) mostly\
    \ performs better than the linear regression since it involves\nmultiple variables\
    \ in the model and is less sensitive to data noise. RTM (e.g., PROSAIL) is capable\
    \ of\nproducing multiple data products (e.g., chlorophyll, water, and LAI) with\
    \ reasonably high accuracies.\nOne essential advantage of this method is its high\
    \ transferability. However, this method has the highest\ncomplexity as it requires\
    \ a wide range of parameters and extensive programming. In terms of machine\n\
    learning, many algorithms, such as RF and SVM, are well established and mostly\
    \ performed well in\nprevious studies. Some programming and model adjustments\
    \ are needed for this method to achieve\noptimal performance. Deep learning is\
    \ a relatively new method and is increasingly popular in recent\nyears. Appropriate\
    \ model design and programming are critical for this approach. It also requires\
    \ a\nsubstantial amount of training data and computing resources to achieve a\
    \ good model performance.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n21 of 44\nTable 7. Comparison\

    \ imaging has been used in agriculture for a wide range of purposes, including\n\
    estimating crop biochemical properties (e.g., chlorophyll, carotenoids, and water\
    \ contents) and\nbiophysical properties (e.g., LAI, biomass) for understanding\
    \ vegetation physiological status and\npredicting yield, evaluating crop nutrient\
    \ status (e.g., nitrogen deﬁciency), monitoring crop disease,\nand investigating\
    \ soil properties (e.g., soil moisture, soil organic matter, and soil carbon).\
    \ Previous\nstudies have also summarized some of the above-mentioned applications\
    \ of hyperspectral remote\nsensing in precision agriculture [4,84]. In this section,\
    \ we will thus focus more on recent hyperspectral\nstudies and summarize these\
    \ studies according to speciﬁc applications.\n4.1. Estimation of Crop Biochemical\
    \ and Biophysical Properties\nOne important hyperspectral application in agriculture\
    \ is monitoring crop conditions through\nthe retrieval of crop biochemical and\
    \ biophysical properties [8,99]. For instance, the leaf chlorophyll\ncontent is\
    \ an essential biochemical property inﬂuencing the vegetation photosynthetic capacity\
    \ and\ncontrolling crop productivity [99]. In previous studies, Oppelt and Mauser\
    \ [105] collected AVIS data\nto retrieve the chlorophyll and nitrogen contents\
    \ in a winter wheat ﬁeld. Similarly, Moharana and\nDutta [43] used Hyperion data\
    \ to estimate the contents of these two biochemical components in a rice\nﬁeld.\
    \ LAI, on the other hand, is a fundamental vegetation biophysical parameter and\
    \ is highly related\nto crop biomass and yield [98]. Previous studies have used\
    \ hyperspectral remote sensing to estimate\nthe LAI of diﬀerent crops, and some\
    \ of the example studies are shown in Table 8.\nTable 8. Selected previous studies\
    \ estimating LAI for diﬀerent crop types using hyperspectral images.\nCrops\n\
    Previous Studies\nResearch Focuses\nWinter wheat\nXie et al. [109]\nEstimated\
    \ canopy LAI in a winter wheat ﬁeld using airborne\nhyperspectral imagery and\
    \ proposed a new vegetation index for\nimproved estimation accuracy.\nSiegmann\
    \ et al. [73]\nRetrieved LAI of two wheat ﬁelds using EnMAP images and\nattempted\
    \ to pan-sharp the images aiming to improve the\nspatial resolution of LAI products.\n\
    Barley\nJarmer [99]\nRetrieved a range of canopy variables from barley, including\n\
    LAI, chlorophyll, water, and fresh matter content using HyMap\ndata and established\
    \ an eﬃcient approach for monitoring the\nspatial patterns of crop variables.\n\
    Rice\nYu et al. [37]\nInvestigated LAI, leaf chlorophyll content, canopy water\n\
    content, and dry matter content using UAV-based hyperspectral\nimagery, aiming\
    \ to understand the growing status of rice.\nMixed\nagricultural\nﬁelds\nRichter\
    \ et al. [98]\nEstimated crop LAI and water content with airborne HyMap\ndata\
    \ aiming to support operational agricultural practices (e.g.,\nirrigation management\
    \ and crop stress detection) in the context\nof the EnMap hyperspectral mission.\n\
    Wu et al. [45]\nEstimated chlorophyll content and LAI in a mixed agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld (e.g., corns, chestnuts trees, and tea plants) using Hyperion\ndata and identiﬁed\
    \ spectral bands and vegetation indices that\ngenerated the highest accuracy.\n\
    Verger et al. [57]\nEstimated LAI, fCover, and FAPAR in an agricultural site with\n\
    diﬀerent crops using PROBA-CHRIS data.\nLocherer et al. [74]\nEstimated LAI in\
    \ mixed crop ﬁelds using EnMAP data and\ncompared the result accuracy to that\
    \ of LAI estimation with\nairborne data.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n23 of 44\n\
    In addition to the above-mentioned vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties,\
    \ crop water\ncontent is a critical parameter for revealing water stress. Richter\
    \ et al. [98] attempted to estimate the\nwater content in maize, sugar beet, and\
    \ winter wheat using airborne HyMap data. Moharana and\nDutta [204] investigated\
    \ the water stress in a rice ﬁeld and its variations using Hyperion images and\n\
    indicated that the remote sensing-estimated water content matched well with ﬁeld-observed\
    \ data.\nIzzo et al. [128] evaluated the water status in a commercial vineyard\
    \ using UAV-based hyperspectral\ndata and determined wavelengths sensitive to\
    \ the canopy water content. Sahoo et al. [4] discussed the\napplications of hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing data for evaluating water features in crops and listed\nseveral\
    \ vegetation indices for calculating the water content.\nIt can be found from\
    \ the literature review that many previous studies have focused on estimating\n\
    the crop chlorophyll content, LAI, and water content using hyperspectral imagery,\
    \ while other\nimportant crop properties, such as carotenoids, that are sensitive\
    \ to plant stress are less explored.\nIn addition, crop production is inﬂuenced\
    \ by all of these vegetation properties (e.g., chlorophyll,\nwater, and LAI).\
    \ Besides investigating the spatial and temporal variations of each property,\
    \ it is also\ncritical to evaluate the relationships between these properties\
    \ and further understand how they aﬀect\ncrop growth and crop production.\nEstimating\
    \ crop biomass and forecasting yield are also important applications of remote\
    \ sensing,\nas they will contribute to the understanding of crop productivity\
    \ and implementing suitable\nmanagement measures [126]. Yue et al. [124] utilized\
    \ UAV-based hyperspectral images for estimating the\nabove-ground biomass of winter\
    \ wheat. Yang [205] and Mariotto et al. [15] utilized both multispectral\nand\
    \ hyperspectral data to estimate crop yield and found that the hyperspectral imagery-based\
    \ model\nperformed better. In addition, crop residues left in the ﬁeld are critical\
    \ materials protecting soil\nfrom water and wind erosion and inﬂuencing soil biochemical\
    \ processes. Previous studies, such as\nBannari et al. [106], Galloza and Crawford\
    \ [47], Bannari et al. [46], have used diﬀerent hyperspectral\nimages for the\
    \ estimation of crop residues on farmlands\nBeyond the estimation of crop biomass\
    \ and residue, one further research topic is investigating\nbioenergy (e.g., biogas),\
    \ which can be generated from the crop biomass. Thomas et al. [100] attempted\n\
    to estimate the amount of biogas that can be generated per unit of biomass using\
    \ airborne HyMap\ndata and achieved satisfactory results. Overall, hyperspectral\
    \ imagery has contributed greatly to the\nestimation of crop biomass, yield, and\
    \ other related features (e.g., bioenergy, crop residues). Since crop\nbiomass\
    \ and yield are highly aﬀected by agricultural practices (e.g., watering and nutrition\
    \ treatment),\ninvolving these practice data, together with hyperspectral imagery,\
    \ in the model can potentially\ngenerate better results. More research in this\
    \ area is warranted.\n4.2. Evaluating Crop Nutrient Status\nPrecision farming\
    \ involves evaluating the crop nutrient status and providing recommendations\n\
    on site-speciﬁc resource management according to crop needs [206]. Such an approach\
    \ is critical for\nimproving the resource use eﬃciency and reducing environmental\
    \ impacts [4,103]. Previous studies\nhave used hyperspectral images for estimating\
    \ the nitrogen content of diﬀerent crop types, as shown\nin Table 9.\nTable 9.\

    \ of band selection on the evaluation\naccuracy.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n\
    25 of 44\nOverall, owing to the large amount of spectral information in hyperspectral\
    \ imagery, crop nutrient\nstatus can be evaluated with high accuracies, and a\
    \ corresponding fertilizer treatment plan can be\nproposed to achieve optimal\
    \ crop productions. However, it is also essential to keep in mind that there is\n\
    a wide range of factors, such as soil moisture, soil type, and topographic conditions,\
    \ that can impact crop\ngrowth and production. A more comprehensive treatment\
    \ plan that takes into consideration both the\ncrop nutrient status and other\
    \ inﬂuencing factors can make a greater contribution to crop production.\n4.3.\
    \ Classifying Imagery to Identify Crop Types, Growing Stages, Weeds/Invasive Species,\
    \ and Stress/Disease\nBesides quantifying crop properties, hyperspectral images\
    \ have also been used for classiﬁcation\npurposes, such as differentiating crop\
    \ types, identifying crop growing stages, classifying weeds or invasive\nspecies,\
    \ and detecting disease [218]. Examples of previous studies are shown in Table\
    \ 10. Diﬀerent\nagricultural land covers or crop types have diﬀerent spectral\
    \ characteristics; hence, hyperspectral\nimages can contribute greatly to the\
    \ classiﬁcation of these agricultural features.\nTable 10. Selected previous studies\

    Applications\nPrevious Studies\nResearch Focuses\nClassiﬁcation of\ncrop types\n\
    Camacho Velasco et al. [48]\nUtilized Hyperion data and diﬀerent classiﬁcation\

    for identifying ﬁve types of crops (e.g., oil palm, rubber, grass\nfor grazing,\
    \ citrus, and sugar cane) in Colombia.\nBostan et al. [51]\nClassiﬁed diﬀerent\
    \ crop and land cover types (e.g., maize,\ncotton, urban, water, barren rock,\

    \ classiﬁcation\npurposes and listed several spectral libraries available\nworldwide.\
    \ The authors also indicated the limitations of using a\nspectral library, such\
    \ as the spectral varieties within the same\nspecies or land cover, and highlighted\
    \ the importance of having\ngeographically speciﬁc libraries\nWeed infestation\
    \ is a severe issue in agricultural ﬁelds and could substantially aﬀect crop growth\n\
    and yield. Identifying and mapping weeds in agricultural ﬁelds using remote sensing\
    \ will contribute\ngreatly to variable rate treatment in the ﬁelds [219]. Researchers\
    \ have utilized diﬀerent remote sensing\ndata and methods for weed mapping, as\
    \ shown in Table 11. Overall, the identiﬁcation of weeds\ntypically requires a\
    \ high spatial resolution since many weeds are small in size and mixed with crops.\n\

    \ to growers trying to reduce economic and yield\nlosses [38]. Hyperspectral imaging\
    \ collects signals at fine spectral resolutions (e.g., less than 10-nm\nintervals),\
    \ and thus can possibly detect early symptoms of crop disease and support timely\n\
    interventions [225].\nPrevious studies have used hyperspectral images for detecting\
    \ diseases in\ndiﬀerent types of groups (Table 12). Overall, hyperspectral signals\
    \ are sensitive to the variations of\ncrop growth status (e.g., caused by disease\
    \ or stress) and thus can indicate the occurrence of crop\ndisease or stress.\
    \ However, considering that crop status can be aﬀected by other factors (e.g.,\
    \ nutrient\ndeﬁciency), repeat imaging and analysis together with robust modelling\
    \ would be critical for accurate\nand timely detection of crop disease or stress.\n\

    \ Moisture, Fertility, and Other Physical or Chemical Properties\nAgricultural\
    \ soil properties, including soil moisture, soil organic matter, soil salinity,\
    \ and roughness,\nare important factors inﬂuencing crop growth and ﬁnal production\
    \ [7]. Hyperspectral remote sensing\ncan contribute greatly to the investigation\
    \ of these factors. For instance, estimating soil moisture is\none of the most\
    \ popular research topics. Finn et al. [108] estimated soil moisture at three\
    \ diﬀerent\ndepths using airborne hyperspectral images and linear regression and\
    \ discussed the contributions and\nlimitations of hyperspectral remote sensing\
    \ for soil moisture studies. Casa et al. [229] investigated\nsoil water, clay,\
    \ and sand contents using a fusion of CHRIS-PROBA images and soil geophysical\
    \ data.\nShoshany et al. [7] summarized four main approaches for estimating soil\
    \ moisture content: (1) Radar\ntechniques; (2) radiation balance and surface temperature\
    \ calculations; (3) reﬂectance in the visible,\nNIR, and SWIR ranges; and (4)\
    \ integrative methods using multiple spectral ranges. Although soil\nmoisture\
    \ can be estimated using optical remote sensing data, it is often aﬀected by the\
    \ plant ground\ncover. Integrating multi-type remote sensing data, e.g., SAR and\
    \ thermal data, can possibly generate\nmore accurate estimates.\nSOC is a critical\
    \ component of soil fertility, which highly controls both the growth and yield\
    \ of\ncrops. Hyperspectral data provide ﬁne spectral details that are critical\
    \ for the estimation of SOC content.\nPrevious studies have used hyperspectral\
    \ images collected by diﬀerent platforms for investigating\nSOC (Table 13). Overall,\
    \ hyperspectral imagery has a high potential for the estimation of soil organic\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2659\n28 of 44\nmatter and carbon. However, similar to\
    \ the evaluation of soil moisture, the investigation of soil organic\nmatter and\
    \ carbon can be highly inﬂuenced by vegetation cover. Therefore, collecting hyperspectral\n\
    images in non-growing seasons could be a solution.\nTable 13. Selected previous\
    \ studies for estimating soil organic carbon using hyperspectral images\nacquired\

    Zhang et al. [50]\nUtilized EO-1 Hyperion images for estimating several soil\n\

    \ relationship between SOC in croplands and\nspectral signals using a soil database\
    \ and then estimated SOC in\ntheir study sites using airborne hyperspectral imagery.\
    \ With this\napproach, the authors attempted to reduce the amount of new\ndata\
    \ collection in the ﬁeld or lab.\nVan Wesemael et al. [107]\nDiscussed the impacts\
    \ of vegetation cover on soil and the\nestimation of SOC from remote sensing data\
    \ and attempted to\nuse spectral unmixing techniques to estimate the fraction\
    \ of\nvegetation cover and then estimate the soil carbon content using\nthe residue\
    \ soil spectra.\nMultiple\nplatforms\nGomez et al. [49]\nEstimated SOC using both\
    \ lab-based hyperspectral reﬂectance\ndata and Hyperion image data and found that\
    \ using the\nlab-acquired reﬂectance data can generate more accurate results\n\
    than using the Hyperion data. At the same time, the Hyperion\ndata can generate\
    \ a SOC map that matches ﬁeld observations\nand thus can also be used for prediction.\n\
    Hyperspectral remote sensing data have also been used for estimating other soil\
    \ features, as shown\nin Table 14. It can be found from these studies that hyperspectral\
    \ images can be used for studying a\nwide range of soil features. Diﬀerent soil\
    \ features inﬂuence the spectral signals in diﬀerent bands and\nwith diﬀerent\
    \ magnitudes, while some of these inﬂuences may be spectrally overlapped. Therefore,\n\
    when investigating a speciﬁc soil feature, it is critical to collect a suitable\
    \ number of soil samples with\nother soil features generally controlled.\nRemote\

    \ has great potential for applications in agriculture, particularly precision\n\
    agriculture, owing to ample spectral information sensitive to diﬀerent plant and\
    \ soil biophysical and\nbiochemical properties. Multiple platforms, including\
    \ satellites, airplanes, UAVs, and close-range\nplatforms, have become more widely\
    \ available in recent years for collecting hyperspectral images with\ndiﬀerent\
    \ spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. These platforms also have diﬀerent\
    \ strengths and\nlimitations in terms of spatial coverage, ﬂight endurance, ﬂexibility,\
    \ operational complexity, and cost.\nThese factors need to be considered when\
    \ choosing imaging platform(s) for speciﬁc research purposes.\nFurther technological\
    \ developments are also needed to overcome some of the limitations, such as the\n\
    short battery endurance in UAV operations and high cost of hyperspectral sensors.\n\
    Diﬀerent analytical methods, such as linear regression, advanced regression, machine\
    \ learning,\ndeep learning, and RTM, have been explored in previous studies for\
    \ analyzing the tremendous amount\nof information in hyperspectral images for\
    \ investigating diﬀerent agricultural features. Previous\nstudies have mainly\
    \ used the regression approach, while more physically based methods, such as\n\
    RTM, have been less explored. Deep learning and eﬀective big-data analytics are\
    \ powerful tools for\nrecognizing patterns in remote sensing data. Together with\
    \ hyperspectral imagery, deep learning\nmodels have high potential to support\
    \ the monitoring of a wide range of agricultural features. Diﬀerent\nanalytical\
    \ methods have diﬀerent advantages and disadvantages, and thus it is critical\
    \ to compare\nthese methods for speciﬁc research (e.g., requirements of accuracy\
    \ and computing eﬃciency) and\nchoose an optimal approach. In addition, image\
    \ spectral information has been commonly used as\nvariables for prediction or\
    \ classiﬁcation tasks, while other information, such as texture, has been less\n\
    explored. Further, some other sources of data, such as weather, irrigation records,\
    \ and historical yield\ninformation, can also be used in some of the analytical\
    \ methods (e.g., machine learning and deep\nlearning) for better monitoring of\
    \ crop features. More research in these ﬁelds is also warranted.\nHyperspectral\
    \ imaging has been successfully applied in a wide range of agricultural applications,\n\
    including estimating crop biochemical and biophysical properties; evaluating crop\
    \ nutrient and stress\nstatus; classifying or detecting crop types, weeds, and\
    \ diseases; and investigating soil characteristics.\nPrevious studies have focused\
    \ on discussing one or two of the many factors impacting crop growth\nperformance\
    \ and productivity, and thus cannot evaluate crop status and growth-limiting factors\n\
    comprehensively. It is important to integrate these factors to achieve a better\
    \ understanding of their\ninter-relationships for optimal crop production and\
    \ environmental protection. Besides, previous studies\nusing hyperspectral imaging\
    \ have mainly targeted investigating crop growth, aiming to improve\ncrop yield,\
    \ while less research has focused on understanding the ecosystem side of crop\
    \ production\n(e.g., ecosystem services and biodiversity). Further research in\
    \ these areas is warranted.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S., J.L.,\

    rescence (SIF) has shown great potential to monitor the pho-\ntosynthetic activity\
    \ of terrestrial ecosystems. However, sev-\neral issues, including low spatial\
    \ and temporal resolution\nof the gridded datasets and high uncertainty of the\
    \ individ-\nual retrievals, limit the applications of SIF. In addition, in-\n\
    consistency in measurement footprints also hinders the di-\nrect comparison between\
    \ gross primary production (GPP)\nfrom eddy covariance (EC) ﬂux towers and satellite-retrieved\n\
    SIF. In this study, by training a neural network (NN) with\nsurface reﬂectance\
    \ from the MODerate-resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) and SIF from\
    \ Orbiting Carbon\nObservatory-2 (OCO-2), we generated two global spatially\n\
    contiguous SIF (CSIF) datasets at moderate spatiotempo-\nral (0.05◦ 4-day) resolutions\
    \ during the MODIS era, one\nfor clear-sky conditions (2000–2017) and the other\
    \ one in\nall-sky conditions (2000–2016). The clear-sky instantaneous\nCSIF (CSIFclear-inst)\
    \ shows high accuracy against the clear-\nsky OCO-2 SIF and little bias across\
    \ biome types. The all-\nsky daily average CSIF (CSIFall-daily) dataset exhibits\
    \ strong\nspatial, seasonal and interannual dynamics that are consistent\nwith\
    \ daily SIF from OCO-2 and the Global Ozone Monitor-\ning Experiment-2 (GOME-2).\
    \ An increasing trend (0.39 %)\nof annual average CSIFall-daily is also found,\
    \ conﬁrming the\ngreening of Earth in most regions. Since the difference be-\n\
    tween satellite-observed SIF and CSIF is mostly caused by\nthe environmental down-regulation\
    \ on SIFyield, the ratio be-\ntween OCO-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst can be an effective\
    \ in-\ndicator of drought stress that is more sensitive than the nor-\nmalized\
    \ difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation\nindex. By comparing CSIFall-daily\
    \ with GPP estimates from\n40 EC ﬂux towers across the globe, we ﬁnd a large cross-\n\
    site variation (c.v. = 0.36) of the GPP–SIF relationship with\nthe highest regression\
    \ slopes for evergreen needleleaf for-\nest. However, the cross-biome variation\
    \ is relatively limited\n(c.v. = 0.15). These two contiguous SIF datasets and\
    \ the de-\nrived GPP–SIF relationship enable a better understanding of\nthe spatial\
    \ and temporal variations of the GPP across biomes\nand climate.\n1\nIntroduction\n\
    Obtaining a spatiotemporal continuous photosynthetic car-\nbon ﬁxation or gross\
    \ primary production (GPP) dataset is\ncrucial to food security, ecosystem service\
    \ and health eval-\nuation, and global carbon cycle studies (Beer et al., 2010).\n\
    However, this is not possible without remote sensing data,\nsince in situ carbon\
    \ ﬂux measurements, such as FLUXNET\n(Baldocchi et al., 2001), are usually costly\
    \ and have lim-\nited spatial and temporal coverage (Schimel et al., 2015).\n\
    Many remote-sensing-based productivity efﬁciency models\n(PEMs) have been built,\
    \ but the model structure and param-\neterizations differ from each other and\
    \ the performance of\nmost models is not satisfactory in terms of simulated inter-\n\
    annual variability and trends (Anav et al., 2015; Chen et al.,\n2017).\nMüller\
    \ (1874) found that the chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\n(Chl F) from a dilute chlorophyll\
    \ solution was much stronger\nthan the Chl F from a green leaf, suggesting that\
    \ an alterna-\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European\
    \ Geosciences Union.\n5780\nY. Zhang et al.: A global spatially contiguous solar-induced\
    \ ﬂuorescence dataset\ntive energy pathway exists for leaves in vivo. In the 1980s,\n\
    scientists found that plant photosynthesis and heat dissipa-\ntion are two alternatives\
    \ to quench the excited chlorophyll,\nand there is a close linkage between Chl\
    \ F and carbon as-\nsimilation rate (Genty et al., 1989; Krause and Weis, 1991).\n\
    Leaf-level photosynthesis (Aleaf) and ﬂuorescence (Chl F)\nshare the same source\
    \ of energy originating from photo-\nsynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed\
    \ by chlorophyll\n(APARchl), which can be written using a light-use efﬁciency\n\
    (LUE) approach (Monteith, 1972):\nChl F = PAR × f PARchl × φF\n(1)\nAleaf = PAR\
    \ × f PARchl × φP,\n(2)\nwhere φF and φP represent the efﬁciencies for Chl F emis-\n\
    sion and photochemistry, respectively. f PARchl, being differ-\nent from the conventional\
    \ deﬁnition of fraction of photosyn-\nthetically active radiation absorption,\
    \ only considers the frac-\ntions absorbed by chlorophyll pigments where the photosyn-\n\
    thesis and ﬂuorescence originate (Zhang et al., 2018c). How-\never, Chl F measurements\
    \ have been mostly conducted at the\nleaf level, using pulse amplitude modulation\
    \ (PAM) ﬂuorom-\neters (Porcar-Castell et al., 2008; Roháˇcek and Barták, 1999).\n\
    In this case, the measured Chl F intensity is not induced by\nthe Sun but by the\
    \ modulated light source. Although the ab-\nsolute value of the Chl F intensity\
    \ does not directly link to\nAleaf, it can still be used to calculate the ﬂuorescence\
    \ yield\nand investigate the reaction mechanism of the energy parti-\ntioning\
    \ during the light reaction, and to calculate the quantum\nyield for photochemistry\
    \ or as a tool to detect plant reactions\nunder stress (Adams and Demmig-Adams,\
    \ 2004; Flexas et\nal., 2002).\nThe successful retrieval of solar-induced (steady-state)\n\
    chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) from satellites has made it\npossible for vegetation\
    \ photosynthetic activities to be ob-\nserved at the global scale (Frankenberg\
    \ et al., 2011; Guanter\net al., 2012; Joiner et al., 2011, 2013). Satellite SIF\
    \ can be\nexpressed as a function similar to the Chl F at the leaf level\nbut\
    \ with extra terms considering the radiative transfer within\nthe canopy and through\
    \ the atmosphere (Joiner et al., 2014):\nSIFsat(λ) = PAR × f PARchl × 2F (λ) ×\
    \ fesc(λ,θs,θv,φ)\n× τatm(λ,θs,θv,φ),\n(3)\nwhere the satellite-retrieved SIF\
    \ (SIFsat), ﬂuorescence yield\n(2F ), fesc and τatm are all functions of the wavelength\
    \ (λ); in\naddition, fesc and τatm are also affected by sun-sensor geom-\netry\
    \ characterized by Sun zenith angle (SZA; θs), view zenith\nangle (θv) and relative\
    \ azimuth angle (φ). fesc is a factor de-\nscribing how much SIF emitted by the\
    \ chloroplast leaves the\ncanopy, and τatm is a function of atmospheric optical\
    \ depth,\nwhich indicates how much SIF that leaves the canopy top\npasses through\
    \ the atmosphere before it is captured by the\nsatellite sensors. It should be\
    \ noted that the fraction of PAR\nfor ﬂuorescence (f PARF ) may have a different\
    \ activation\nspectrum than that for photosynthesis (f PARchl), but this dif-\n\
    ference is ignored here for simplicity. Although additional\nfactors come into\
    \ play during this process, satellite-retrieved\nSIF shows high consistency with\
    \ GPP using both model\nsimulations and ground-based measurements from eddy co-\n\
    variance (EC) ﬂux towers, at least at the monthly timescale\n(Guanter et al.,\
    \ 2014; Li et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2016c,\nb). In addition, recent studies\
    \ suggest that the GPP–SIF rela-\ntionship is consistent across biome types (Sun\
    \ et al., 2017).\nThis ﬁnding, if valid across all biomes, would greatly beneﬁt\n\
    the usage of SIF for model benchmarking (Luo et al., 2012)\nand global GPP estimation.\n\
    However, several issues hinder exploring the relationship\nbetween SIF and in\
    \ situ GPP estimates. Since the SIF sig-\nnal is very small and sensors used to\
    \ retrieve SIF were\nnot initially built to estimate SIF, the satellite-retrieved\
    \ SIF\nusually has a large footprint and large uncertainties in in-\ndividual\
    \ retrievals (Frankenberg et al., 2014; Joiner et al.,\n2013, 2016). For instance,\
    \ the SIF retrieval from the Global\nOzone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) has\
    \ a footprint\nof 40km×40km or larger, and the SIF from the Greenhouse\ngases\
    \ Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has a circular footprint\nwith 10.5 km in diameter.\
    \ Direct comparison between the\nsatellite-retrieved SIF signal and GPP estimates\
    \ from EC ﬂux\ntower sites thus faces the problem of spatial inconsistency\nexcept\
    \ in areas of large homogenous landscape, e.g., the US\nMidwest cropland (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2014) or boreal evergreen\nforests (Walther et al., 2016). However,\
    \ corn (C4 pathway)\nand soybean (C3 pathway) in SIF footprints have different\n\
    electron use efﬁciencies (Guan et al., 2016), which should\naffect the relationship\
    \ between SIF and GPP. The low preci-\nsion of SIF measurements also leads to\
    \ a need for averaging\nmultiple pixels either in space or time before being used.\n\
    SIF retrieved from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2\n(OCO-2) satellite partially\
    \ solved this issue with a much\nsmaller footprint size (1.3km × 2.25km), higher\
    \ signal-to-\nnoise ratio compared to GOSAT (relatively higher SIF re-\ntrieval\
    \ accuracy) and much larger numbers of observations\nper day (Frankenberg et al.,\
    \ 2014; Sun et al., 2018). However,\ndue to the sparse sampling strategy and long\
    \ revisit cycle,\nthe OCO-2 SIF data have large gaps between nearby swaths,\n\
    and the average sampling frequency for each ﬂux tower site\nis only 3.21 year−1\
    \ during 2015–2016 (Lu et al., 2018). In\naddition, OCO-2 is often aggregated\
    \ to a monthly dataset at\nrelatively coarse spatial resolution, typically at\
    \ 1◦×1◦, which\nlimits its application in small regions. Although several sta-\n\
    tistical methods have been proposed to downscale satellite\nobservations to ﬁner\
    \ spatial–temporal resolutions (Tadi´c et\nal., 2015, 2017), considering the large\
    \ land surface hetero-\ngeneity and wide gaps between OCO-2 swaths (∼ 100 km),\n\
    it could be challenging to apply these methods to OCO-2 SIF.\nA high spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution SIF dataset is needed\nto improve our understanding of the relationship\
    \ between\nSIF and GPP and provide accurate GPP estimates at the\nglobal scale.\

    \ contiguous solar-induced ﬂuorescence dataset\n5781\nSIF contains signals from\
    \ APARchl, ﬂuorescence yield, and\ncanopy and atmospheric attenuation. APARchl\
    \ is considered\nto be the ﬁrst-order approximation of SIF as it exhibits high\n\
    correlation with SIF at the canopy scale (Du et al., 2017;\nRossini et al., 2016;\
    \ Verrelst et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018c).\nPrevious studies have shown that\
    \ f PARchl can be inversely\nestimated using the surface reﬂectances and radiative\
    \ trans-\nfer models (Zhang et al., 2005, 2016a). The canopy structure\ninformation\
    \ that affects the SIF reabsorption within canopy\nis also embedded in the near-infrared\
    \ reﬂectance (Badgley\net al., 2017; Knyazikhin et al., 2013; Yang and van der\
    \ Tol,\n2018). Many previous studies have shown high correlation\nbetween SIF\
    \ and vegetation indices (VIs), especially VIs re-\nlated to the chlorophyll concentration\
    \ (Frankenberg et al.,\n2011; Guanter et al., 2012). Therefore, broadband surface\n\
    reﬂectances may have the potential to be used to estimate\nvegetation information\
    \ and reconstruct global SIF (Duveiller\nand Cescatti, 2016; Gentine and Alemohammad,\
    \ 2018a).\nHowever, physical models that can predict SIF (e.g., the\nSoil Canopy\
    \ Observation, Photochemistry and Energy ﬂuxes,\nSCOPE; van der Tol et al., 2009)\
    \ often require many param-\neters, making it difﬁcult to use reﬂectance and modeling\
    \ to\npredict SIF at a larger scale.\nNeural networks (NNs), together with many\
    \ other ma-\nchine learning algorithms, have been used with remote sens-\ning\
    \ datasets in the Earth sciences, especially for carbon and\nwater ﬂuxes estimation\
    \ (Alemohammad et al., 2017; Jung\net al., 2011; Tramontana et al., 2016), land\
    \ cover mapping\n(Kussul et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017), soil moisture re-\n\
    trievals and downscaling (Alemohammad et al., 2018; Ko-\nlassa et al., 2018) or\
    \ to bypass parameterization (Gentine et\nal., 2018). These studies mostly attempted\
    \ to link the satel-\nlite signals with limited in situ observation or model sim-\n\
    ulations for model training, while taking advantage of the\nlarge amount of data\
    \ in remote sensing observations; they\napplied the trained algorithm to generate\
    \ a regional or global\ndataset. Reconstructing SIF from surface reﬂectance, on\
    \ the\nother hand, uses no in situ observations but faces more prob-\nlems related\
    \ to the satellite data quality assurance. The SIF–\nreﬂectance relationship is\
    \ complicated, and the NN beneﬁts\nfrom the fact that an explicit physical and\
    \ radiative transfer\nrelationship is not required.\nIn this study, we aim to\
    \ generate a global contiguous\nSIF (CSIF) product based on the SIF retrievals\
    \ from OCO-\n2 and surface reﬂectances from Moderate-resolution Imag-\ning Spectroradiometer\
    \ (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua\nsatellites. The CSIF dataset aims to ﬁll\
    \ the spatial gaps\nbetween the OCO-2 swaths and temporal gaps due to the\nlong\
    \ revisit cycle of OCO-2. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst trained\nand validated the NN using\
    \ the satellite-observed instanta-\nneous SIF under clear-sky conditions so that\
    \ the relationship\nis not affected by cloud-related artifacts. We further gener-\n\
    ated two SIF products, namely the clear-sky instantaneous\nSIF (CSIFclear-inst)\
    \ and the all-sky daily SIF (CSIFall-daily).\nThe spatiotemporal variations of\
    \ these CSIF products were\nanalyzed and compared with SIF from OCO-2 and three\n\
    other GOME-2 SIF datasets. Finally, we showed two applica-\ntions of CSIF datasets:\
    \ (1) monitoring drought impact using\nCSIFclear-inst and OCO-2 SIF; (2) evaluating\
    \ the GPP–SIF\nrelationship by comparing CSIF with GPP estimates from\n40 ﬂux\
    \ tower sites.\n2\nMaterials and methods\n2.1\nOCO-2 solar-induced chlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence\ndataset\nThe 8100r OCO-2 SIF data between September 2014 and\n\
    December 2017 were used for NN training and evaluation\n(Frankenberg, 2015; Frankenberg\
    \ et al., 2014; Sun et al.,\n2018). The daily sounding-based SIF retrievals at\
    \ 757 nm\nwere ﬁrst aggregated to 0.05◦ (around 5.6km×5.6km at the\nEquator),\
    \ consistent with MODIS Climate Modeling Grid\n(CMG) resolution. The reasons for\
    \ using this resolution in-\nclude the following: (1) it is directly comparable\
    \ (of the same\norder of magnitude) to the OCO-2 SIF footprint size (around\n\
    1.3km × 2.25km) and the samples within each grid cell can\nbe more evenly distributed\
    \ and thus more representative of\nthe grid cell SIF values than using much coarser\
    \ 1◦ × 1◦ or\n2◦ ×2◦ grids; (2) by averaging multiple observations, the un-\n\
    certainty in the SIF signal can be approximately reduced by a\nfactor of √n (n\
    \ is the number of observations within this grid\ncell), assuming independent\
    \ estimates and homogeneous SIF\nvalue within each grid cell (Frankenberg et al.,\
    \ 2014). During\nthis aggregation, we only used cloud-free observations indi-\n\
    cated by the OCO-2 cloud ﬂag. For each 0.05◦ grid cell, the\nSIF value was only\
    \ calculated when it contained more than\nﬁve cloud-free SIF soundings. Although\
    \ several studies have\nshown that SIF at different wavelengths has different\
    \ sen-\nsitivity to stress and leaf and canopy reabsorption (Porcar-\nCastell\
    \ et al., 2014; Rossini et al., 2015, 2016), we only use\nSIF at 757 nm since\
    \ it showed superior performance to SIF\nat 771 nm in predicting GPP (Li et al.,\
    \ 2018a). The years\n2015 and 2016 were used for training and 2014 and 2017\n\
    were used for validation. Altogether, 2 947 819 SIF grid cells\npassed quality\
    \ check during 2014–2017. Figure 1 shows the\nspatial distribution of the SIF\
    \ grid cells used for training and\nvalidation (test). It should be noted that\
    \ the OCO-2 satellite\nstarted obtaining data from September 2014 and experienced\n\
    some malfunctioning during August and September in 2017,\ncausing lower coverage\
    \ for validation samples in boreal re-\ngions.\nIn addition to these cloud-free\
    \ observations, we also cal-\nculated the all-sky SIF at 0.05◦ resolution. All\
    \ SIF retrievals\nthat passed the suggested quality checks (documented in de-\n\
    tailed by Sun et al., 2018) were used for the aggregation. The\naggregated all-sky\
    \ instantaneous SIF retrievals were con-\nverted to daily values based on the\
    \ solar zenith angle (Zhang\net al., 2018a). We used this dataset to validate\
    \ the all-sky\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800,\

    \ Sect. 2.5). In both cloud-free and\nall-sky aggregations, only observations\
    \ from the nadir mode\nwere used since glint mode tends to underestimate SIF (Sun\n\
    et al., 2018).\n2.2\nMODIS reﬂectance dataset (MCD43C4 V006)\nWe used the 0.05◦\
    \ daily nadir bidirectional reﬂectance dis-\ntribution adjusted reﬂectance (NBAR)\
    \ product from MODIS\n(MCD43C4 V006) during 2000–2017 as input variables for\n\
    the NN. The NBAR product computed the reﬂectance at a\nnadir viewing angle for\
    \ each pixel at local solar noon. Com-\npared to MOD09 or MYD09 surface reﬂectance\
    \ product, it\nremoved the angle effects and therefore should be more sta-\nble\
    \ and consistent (Schaaf et al., 2002). This dataset was\nprocessed in two different\
    \ ways for training and prediction.\nFor the training process, following Gentine\
    \ and Alemoham-\nmad (2018a), we extracted the reﬂectance from the ﬁrst four\n\
    bands of MODIS (centered at 645, 858, 469 and 555 nm, re-\nspectively) for the\
    \ corresponding pixels and days when the\ncloud-free SIF observations were obtained.\
    \ It should be noted\nthat although the MCD43C4 is generated for each day and\n\
    can match the daily SIF observations, the MCD43C4 NBAR\nuses 16 days worth of\
    \ inputs and so that the reﬂectances in-\ncludes the information on other days\
    \ than the day of inter-\nest. However, we consider this to have limited effects\
    \ since\n(1) the vegetation growth/changes are continuous in time,\n(2) the NBAR\
    \ product uses 16-day data but also emphasizes\nthe speciﬁc day of interest (Schaaf,\
    \ 2018). These four bands\nwere selected because the visible and near-infrared\
    \ bands\nincluded most of the vegetation information and drives the\nvariation\
    \ of SIF (Verrelst et al., 2015). We also tested us-\ning all seven bands with/without\
    \ the meteorological variables\n(temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit, obtained\
    \ from the\nOCO-2 SIF lite ﬁles) to train the NN, but the improvements\nin training\
    \ and validation were very minor (R2 increased by\nless than 0.01; data not shown),\
    \ and thus we decided not to\nuse it. Since SIF is very sensitive to the incoming\
    \ solar ra-\ndiation, using cloud-free training samples can minimize the\nuncertainty\
    \ of using cosine of the solar zenith angle as the\nproxy of incoming PAR. It\
    \ should be noted that the training\ndataset may contain snow-affected samples,\
    \ but these were\nnot removed to get a more realistic prediction of SIF during\n\
    winter.\nFor prediction, we ﬁrst aggregated the daily reﬂectance to\n4 days. The\
    \ 4-day temporal resolution is selected to reach a\nbalance among application\
    \ requirements, information redun-\ndancy and dataset sizes. During this process,\

    \ algorithm can be found in Zhang et al. (2017a).\nIn this study, we slightly\
    \ modiﬁed the algorithm by not ap-\nplying the best index slope extraction (BISE)\
    \ algorithm and\nSavitzky–Golay (SG) ﬁlter. The reconstructed 4-day 0.05◦\nreﬂectance\
    \ together with other datasets allowed us to predict\nSIF at 4-day 0.05◦ resolution\
    \ during 2000–2017. Since this\nprocessing does not involve any extra information\
    \ and only\nuses the reﬂectance observations from the successful model\ninversion,\
    \ it should be comparable to the reﬂectance used for\nNN training.\n2.3\nMachine\
    \ learning algorithms\nA feed-forward NN is a number of computational nodes\n\
    (called neurons) structured in a single or multi-layer archi-\ntecture. Each neuron\
    \ is connected with all neurons in the pre-\nvious layer and next layer. The neuron\
    \ values are calculated\nusing an activation function with a pre-activated value,\
    \ i.e.,\nthe weighted sum of all neurons in previous layer plus biases.\nThe training\
    \ of the NN attempts to optimize these weights\nand biases so that the differences\
    \ between the output vari-\nable in the training data and NN prediction are minimized.\
    \ In\nthis study, we used Tensorﬂow (https://www.tensorﬂow.org,\nlast access:\
    \ 27 September 2018) and built feed-forward net-\nworks with one to three layers\
    \ and two to nine neurons for\neach layer. After training models with data from\
    \ 2015 and\n2016, we validated the models using the test dataset from the\nyears\
    \ 2014 and 2017. We then picked the one with best per-\nformance and simplest\
    \ structure for SIF prediction. The rec-\ntiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) was used as\
    \ the activation function\nsince it has shown better performance in our application,\
    \ and\nthe cost function used is the root mean square error (RMSE).\nWe used 50\
    \ epochs with a batch size of 1024. Before training,\neach variable was normalized\
    \ by its mean and standardized\ndeviation. Since the NN is not deep and there\
    \ is no sign of\noverﬁtting, we did not use any regularization methods during\n\
    the training.\n2.4\nReconstructing the clear-sky instantaneous SIF and\ndaily\
    \ SIF\nDuring the NN training process, we only used the SIF\nand reﬂectance data\
    \ in clear-sky conditions, and therefore\ncos(SZA) was used as a proxy of the\
    \ incoming photosyn-\nthetically active radiation at top of canopy. In the prediction\n\
    process, we also used the calculated cos(SZA) based on the\nsatellite overpass\
    \ local solar time and latitude. Since we did\nnot consider the cloud and aerosol\
    \ attenuation of the PAR,\nthis product was referred to as the “clear-sky instantaneous\n\
    SIF (CSIFclear-inst)”.\nIn addition to the clear-sky instantaneous SIF, we also\
    \ cal-\nculated two daily SIF data by assuming that the incoming\nsolar radiation\
    \ is the only factor that drives the diurnal cy-\ncle (Zhang et al., 2018a). All-sky\
    \ daily SIF (CSIFall-daily)\ncan be calculated using the clear-sky top-of-canopy\
    \ radia-\ntion (PARclear-inst) and the daily average radiation from the\nBreathing\
    \ Earth System Simulator (BESS) (Ryu et al., 2018):\nCSIFall-daily = CSIFclear-inst\n\
    PARclear-inst\n× PARBESS\ndaily ,\n(4)\nwhere PARclear−inst was calculated following\
    \ previous stud-\nies that only considered atmospheric scattering (see Ap-\npendix\
    \ A1). Clear-sky daily SIF (CSIFclear-daily) assumes no\ncloud throughout the\
    \ day and can be calculated by multiply-\ning CSIFclear-inst with a daily correction\
    \ factor (γ ) (Zhang et\nal., 2018a):\nCSIFclear−daily = CSIFclear−inst × γ.\n\
    (5)\nγ is calculated as the ratio between the cos(SZA) during the\nsatellite overpass\
    \ and the daily averaged cos(SZA).\n2.5\nGOME-2 SIF (SIFGOME-2), reconstructed\
    \ SIF from\nGOME-2 (RSIFGOME-2) and SIF∗ datasets\nIn this study, we also used\
    \ the GOME-2 SIF (SIFGOME-2),\nreconstructed SIF from GOME-2 (RSIFGOME-2) using\
    \ ma-\nchine learning and the SIF∗ dataset in comparison with our\ncontiguous\
    \ SIF from OCO-2. The GOME-2 SIF V27 was\nretrieved using a principle component\
    \ analysis algorithm in\nthe wavelength range 734–758 nm (Joiner et al., 2013,\
    \ 2016).\nThe V27 version, compared to the widely used V26, provides\ndaily correction\
    \ factor and improved bias correction and cal-\nibration (https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/,\
    \ last access: 27 Septem-\nber 2018). The level-3 monthly 0.5◦ daily average SIF\
    \ was\nused to compare with CSIFall-daily.\nRSIFGOME-2 (Gentine and Alemohammad,\
    \ 2018a) uses a\nsimilar machine learning technique approach to CSIF but the\n\
    training is based on the biweekly gridded SIF product from\nGOME-2 and the 8-day\
    \ MYD09A1 reﬂectance dataset. Both\nclear-sky and cloudy-sky SIF are used for\
    \ NN training. This\ndataset has a spatial resolution of 0.05◦ and 8-day temporal\n\
    resolution. Both RSIFGOME-2 and CSIFall-daily were aggre-\ngated to the 0.5◦ and\
    \ semi-monthly to facilitate the compari-\nson.\nThe SIF∗ dataset (Duveiller and\
    \ Cescatti, 2016) applies a\nstatistical method and calibrates a model that links\
    \ monthly\n0.5◦ SIF to the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI), evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) and land surface tempera-\nture (LST) dataset for each moving window. The\
    \ model and\nits spatiotemporally varied parameters were then applied to\nﬁner\
    \ resolution dataset (NDVI, ET, LST) with a weighted\naverage to generate SIF\
    \ at 0.05◦ resolution. In this study,\nwe used the 0.5◦ monthly SIF∗ dataset during\
    \ 2007–2013 to\ncompare with CSIF.\n2.6\nComparing CSIF with GPP at ﬂux tower\

    (http://ﬂuxnet.ﬂuxdata.org,\nlast\naccess:\n27\nSeptember\n2018) to investigate\
    \ the SIF–GPP relationship. Since the\nCSIF dataset is continuous in space and\
    \ time, it provides\nmany more samples pairs compared to the original OCO-2\n\
    SIF data (Lu et al., 2018). However, because of the land-\nscape heterogeneity\
    \ and inconsistency between the ﬂux\ntower footprint and CSIF pixel size, a rigorous\
    \ site selection\nis needed. We took the vegetation growth condition into\nconsideration\
    \ during this process: (1) the annual average,\nminimum, maximum and seasonal\
    \ variability (represented\nby standard deviation) of NDVI (from MOD13Q1 C6) for\n\
    the target pixel (where the ﬂux tower is located, 250 m\nby 250 m) need to be\
    \ similar (within 20 % difference or\n0.05 NDVI) to the neighboring (5 km by 5\
    \ km) area; (2) the\nmaximum NDVI value for target pixel and neighboring area\n\
    needs to be greater than 0.2 (not barren). The daily GPP\nestimates, estimated\
    \ using nighttime method (Reichstein\net al., 2005), were averaged and aggregated\
    \ into 4-day\nvalues to compare with CSIF. The 4-day GPP based on\nmore than 80\
    \ % of half-hourly valid (not gap-ﬁlled) net\necosystem exchange was retained.\
    \ Only sites that have at\nleast 92 valid observations (1 year) were used. Only\
    \ 40 out\nof 166 sites passed these criteria and were grouped into\ndifferent\
    \ biome types (Table S1). In addition to CSIFall-daily,\nwe also calculated CSIFclear-daily\
    \ and CSIFsite which used\nﬂux-tower-observed radiation instead of PARBESS\ndaily\
    \ in Eq. (4).\n3\nResults\n3.1\nNN training and validation\nThe NN with one layer\
    \ and ﬁve neurons generally pre-\ndicts the OCO-2 SIF during the training with\
    \ a coefﬁ-\ncient of determination (R2) around 0.8 and an RMSE of\n0.18 mW m−2\
    \ nm−1 sr−1 (Fig. 2). The model also performs\nwell in the validation (R2 = 0.79,\
    \ RMSE = 0.18) and does\nnot show effects of overﬁtting. Using a variety of layer\
    \ (one\nto three) and neuron (two to nine) combinations, we found\nthat one layer\
    \ with ﬁve neurons exhibited slightly higher\nmodel performance during the validation\
    \ compared with a\nmore complex NN (Fig. A1 in Appendix). Therefore, we\nchose\
    \ to use the four-band reﬂectances to feed the one-layer-\nﬁve-neuron NN to generate\
    \ the contiguous SIF for 2000 to\n2017 when MCD43C4 NBAR dataset is available.\n\
    We also investigated the bias of our prediction among dif-\nferent biome types\
    \ in Fig. 3. For 9 out of 14 biome types,\nthe differences between the CSIFclear-inst\
    \ and the satellite-\nretrieved SIF are less than 10 %, and most of the biases\
    \ were\nwithin 5 %. Wetlands and urban ecosystem show a 15 % bias\ncompared to\
    \ the satellite-retrieved SIF, which may be caused\nby the water or built-up contamination\
    \ on the reﬂectance sig-\nnal and the relatively small sample numbers. For savannas\n\
    and grassland, the changes in ﬂuorescence yield due to sea-\nsonal drought may\
    \ be important, which cannot be consid-\nered in the NN based on reﬂectances only.\
    \ Over croplands,\nCSIF exhibits a 12 % underestimation. The croplands usually\n\
    have high nitrogen/chlorophyll concentration that may not be\nfully captured by\
    \ the four broadband reﬂectances (Wu et al.,\n2008). Because we did not build\
    \ biome-speciﬁc NNs for the\ntraining, we do not expect biome-speciﬁc (especially\
    \ needle-\nleaf vs. broadleaf) relationships between SIF and reﬂectance.\nInterestingly,\
    \ we still reproduced SIF with very high accu-\nracy regardless of the plant function\
    \ traits (PFTs), i.e., leaf\ntypes and canopy characteristics (leaf clumping,\
    \ etc.). This\nsuggests that the escape factor and long-term changes in\nmean\
    \ ﬂuorescence yield might be correctly accounted for by\nthe NN across PFTs, through\
    \ the information available in the\nreﬂectances only. However, it should be noted\
    \ that this does\nnot suggest that the NN and reﬂectances can fully replicate\n\
    the ﬂuorescence yield variations due to short-term variations\ncaused by stresses.\n\

    OCO-2 SIF for 12 typical biome types (Fig. 4). The predicted\nCSIF accurately\
    \ captures the seasonal and interannual vari-\nation for most biome types, while\
    \ the standard deviation for\neach DOY is usually smaller than OCO-2 SIF. This\
    \ may sug-\ngest that the uncertainty of SIF is smaller in CSIF dataset.\nFor\
    \ some ecosystems, e.g., DBF, MF and CRO, CSIF shows\nslight underestimation during\
    \ the peak growing season.\nWhen comparing the daily average SIF from satel-\n\
    lite\nretrievals\nwith\nthe\npredicted\nall-sky\ndaily\nCSIF\n(CSIFall-daily)\
    \ dataset (Fig. 5), the predicted SIF exhibits\n∼ 7 % underestimation, with an\
    \ R2 of 0.71 and a RMSE\nof 0.08 mW m−2 nm−1 sr−1. The clear-sky daily CSIF\n\
    (CSIFclear-daily) shows ∼ 11 % overestimation, with a slightly\nhigher R2 and\
    \ lower RMSE. Considering the uncertainty in\nSIF retrievals and the inconsistency\
    \ in time of the compari-\nson (satellite SIF was based on instantaneous PAR at\
    \ the time\nof satellite overpass and converted to daily values assuming\nthe\
    \ atmospheric condition did not change within a day; pre-\ndicted CSIF was based\
    \ on 4-day average PAR), the all-sky\ndaily CSIF performs reasonably well.\n3.2\n\
    Spatial–temporal variation of the global 0.05◦ SIF\ndatasets\nUsing the trained\
    \ NN with the gap-ﬁlled reﬂectance datasets,\nwe produced two global CSIF datasets\
    \ at 4-day temporal and\n0.05◦ spatial resolution. Figure 6 shows the spatial\
    \ patterns\nof the 90th percentile for each pixel and the annual average\nfor\
    \ both clear-sky instantaneous CSIF (CSIFclear-inst) and the\nall-sky daily average\
    \ CSIF (CSIFall-daily). For the 90th per-\ncentile, CSIFclear-inst exhibits hotspots\
    \ in the tropical rain-\nforest, south Asia and the North American corn belt,\
    \ con-\nsistent with regions with high peak productivity (Guanter et\nal., 2014);\
    \ CSIFall-daily shows similar spatial patterns but with\nrelatively lower values\
    \ in the tropical forest, due to the per-\nsistent cloud coverage. For the annual\
    \ average SIF, tropical\nforests exceed temperate cropland and show very high\
    \ val-\nues for instantaneous clear-sky SIF. In all conditions, African\ntropical\
    \ forests exhibit lower values than Amazonian and\nSoutheast Asian tropical forests.\n\
    We further investigated the seasonal and interannual vari-\nations of the all-sky\
    \ daily SIF across the latitudes. The tropi-\ncal regions show continuous high\
    \ SIF values across seasons,\nand the northern mid- to high-latitude regions also\
    \ exhibit\nrecurrent high values during the Northern Hemisphere sum-\nmers (Fig.\
    \ 7a). Near 40◦ S, a hot spot is present in austral\nsummer, with high interannual\
    \ variability. Low SIF values\ncan be found in dry years (2006–2007, 2009–2010),\
    \ while\nhigh values were observed in wet or normal years (2010–\n2011, 2012–2015).\
    \ The global average SIF also displays a\nstrong seasonality coinciding with the\
    \ Northern Hemisphere\ngrowing season (Fig. 7b). For the annual total SIF values,\
    \ a\nstatistically signiﬁcant increasing trend (Mann–Kendall test,\np<0.0001)\
    \ is found with around 0.39 % increase per year.\nThe year 2015 exhibited a low\
    \ anomaly after detrending,\nwhich may be caused by the El Niño events (Fig. 7c).\n\
    The spatial pattern of the trend in CSIFall-daily is displayed\nin Fig. 8. An\
    \ increasing trend dominates Europe, southeast\nAsia and south Amazon. A decreasing\
    \ trend is mostly found\nin east Brazil, east Africa and some areas of inland\
    \ Eurasia.\nThe histogram also shows a positive shift with a magnitude\n(0.00027\
    \ mW nm−1 sr−1 yr−1) similar to the average global\ntrend in Fig. 7c. The spatial\
    \ pattern of CSIFall-daily is very\nsimilar to the trend pattern of MODIS enhanced\

    \ between CSIF and RSIF or\nCSIF and SIF∗ is consistent across most regions across\
    \ the\nglobe (Fig. 9). The R2 values are generally high (> 0.8) for\nmost regions\
    \ except over tropical rainforests, barren regions\nin western US, northwestern\
    \ China, and northern Canada\nand Russia. The low R2 values are mostly due to\
    \ the rela-\ntively low variability in the temporal domain in the tropics\nbut\
    \ are also indicative of regions strongly polluted by cloud\ncover in which CSIF\
    \ might have a competitive advantage,\nas the training OCO-2 data better observe\
    \ the surface due to\nsmaller footprint and with higher signal-to-noise ratio.\
    \ The\nregression slopes are higher for regions with persistent cloud\ncover (e.g.,\
    \ tropical forest). In the time series comparison\n(Fig. 9e–p), all three SIF\
    \ datasets show similar seasonal pat-\nterns, while GOME-2-based RSIF and SIF∗\
    \ generally show\nhigher values than CSIF. In addition, RSIF exhibits larger\n\
    ﬂuctuation during the non-growing season for some sites,\nwhich may be caused\
    \ by snow contamination.\nWe further compared the CSIFall-daily with GOME-2 daily\n\
    average SIF (Fig. 10). In general, the correlation is much\nlower as compared\
    \ with RSIF for most regions. For regions\nwith high variability in temporal domain,\
    \ the CSIFall-daily still\nshows high R2 values with respect to GOME-2 SIF. The\
    \ re-\ngression slopes exhibit smaller variation except for the Ama-\nzonian tropical\
    \ rainforests, southeast Asia and barren regions\nin the Sahara, western US, northwestern\
    \ China, central Aus-\ntralia and the Andes mountains in South America. In gen-\n\
    eral, considering the various uncertainties and different satel-\nlite overpass\
    \ times, sensors used and retrieval algorithms,\nCSIFall-daily well captured the\
    \ GOME-2 SIF variations both\nin space and time. In addition, since GOME-2 SIF\
    \ in most\nArgentina is affected by the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA),\nthe coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination values are also lower as com-\npared with Fig. 9.\n3.4\nUsing\
    \ CSIF for drought monitoring\nSince the CSIF dataset only uses broadband reﬂectances,\
    \ it\nshould not contain the SIFyield information. Compared to\nthe SIF retrieved\
    \ from OCO-2, the difference can be mostly\nattributed to the SIFyield. Therefore,\
    \ the difference or ratio\nbetween SIFOCO-2 and CSIF can reﬂect the environmental\n\
    stress on SIFyield. Figure 11 shows the difference between\ninstantaneous clear-day\
    \ OCO-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst. Ex-\ncept for Fig. 11c, the difference mostly\
    \ captures the phys-\niological limitation of drought on energy partitioning after\n\
    being absorbed by chlorophyll. The spatial extent of drought\nis also well-captured\
    \ by the difference, where the most se-\nvere drought-impacted places also exhibited\
    \ the largest de-\ncline (e.g., Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe in Fig. 11a, north-\n\
    east Amazon in Fig.11b and southern Spain, southernmost\nFrance, central Italy,\
    \ Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina).\nThe drought impact on California is less\
    \ pronounced, pos-\nsibly because of the irrigation systems and sparse sampling\n\
    points.\nWe further focused on the 2015 European drought to com-\npare the drought\
    \ response of CSIF and two vegetation indices\n(NDVI and EVI). Because the OCO-2\
    \ samples were not col-\nlected at the same swath for each DOY, a large ﬂuctuation\n\
    can be found in OCO-2 SIF and on the CSIF (which are using\nthe same pixels for\
    \ a fair comparison) (Fig. 12a–d). However,\nwhen calculating the ratio between\
    \ CSIF and OCO-2 SIF, its\nvariation can be mostly attributed to the variation\
    \ in SIFyield,\nwhich can quantify the drought stress on plant physiology.\nIn\
    \ all three regions, the ratio between OCO-2 SIF and CSIF\nexperienced a decrease\
    \ during the drought period, but the\nsignal is only obvious after applying a\
    \ smoothing ﬁlter. The\ntwo vegetation indices, NDVI and EVI, on the other hand,\n\
    show a reduced response in Spain and Italy, perhaps due to\nthe plants’ adaption\
    \ or very short drought duration.\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800, 2018\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\n\

    \ contiguous SIF produced by\nmachine learning\nVegetation photosynthetic activity\
    \ has variations in several\nrespects controlled by vegetation type, phenology,\
    \ coverage\nand interactions with the environment. These variations can\nbe expressed\
    \ in the spatial, seasonal, diurnal and/or interan-\nnual domains (Zhang et al.,\
    \ 2018a). Machine learning algo-\nrithms try to minimize the differences between\
    \ the predicted\nSIF and the satellite-observed SIF. For OCO-2 SIF and the\nMODIS\
    \ reﬂectance used for NN training, the variance in the\nspatial and seasonal domains\
    \ is largest. Therefore, the NN\ngenerally predicts SIF well in these two domains.\
    \ The inter-\nannual variations (i.e., the variations caused by year-to-year\n\
    anomalies, e.g., due to drought) typically have much smaller\nvariance and are\
    \ more difﬁcult to capture. This is why some\nmachine learning products fail to\
    \ reproduce interannual vari-\nability accurately (Jung et al., 2011). Using additional\
    \ vari-\nables that are sensitive to this interannual anomaly in the\nmodel training\
    \ can improve the model performance (Alemo-\nhammad et al., 2017; Gentine and\
    \ Alemohammad, 2018b;\nTramontana et al., 2016).\nIn this study, since the variations\
    \ in SIFyield are relatively\nsmall (Lee et al., 2015) and cannot be detected\
    \ by broadband\nsurface reﬂectances, the SIFyield information may not be re-\n\
    produced by our CSIF data. Because the environmental lim-\nitation on SIFyield\
    \ may be complicated (may not be a linear\ncombination of temperature, vapor pressure\
    \ deﬁcit (VPD) or\nsurface reﬂectance in the shortwave infrared) and biome spe-\n\
    ciﬁc (van der Tol et al., 2014), inclusion of other environmen-\ntal variables\
    \ and reﬂectances in shortwave bands during NN\ntraining did not greatly increase\
    \ the SIF prediction accuracy.\nIt should also be noted that SIFyield is relatively\
    \ stable when\nno strong environmental limitation is present (Zhang et al.,\n\
    2018c). Therefore, the CSIF product should be considered as\na good proxy of OCO-2\
    \ SIF.\nThe satellite-retrieved SIF has a relatively large uncer-\ntainty for\
    \ each individual sounding, typically ranging be-\ntween 0.3 and 0.5 mW m−2 nm−1\
    \ sr−1 (Frankenberg et al.,\n2014). Previous site-level studies usually use SIF\
    \ averaged\nover a large buffered area (Li et al., 2018a; Verma et al.,\n2017)\
    \ to reduce the uncertainty. Assuming the uncertainty\nis unbiased and has a Gaussian\
    \ distribution, machine learn-\ning algorithms are designed to reproduce SIF with\
    \ lower un-\ncertainty. Compared with previous studies that use light-use\nefﬁciency\
    \ models to downscale SIF to higher resolution (Du-\nveiller and Cescatti, 2016),\
    \ this study does not rely on multi-\nple modeled input (evapotranspiration, for\
    \ example) that may\nintroduce additional uncertainties.\nWe also found a signiﬁcant\
    \ increasing trend (0.39 % yr−1)\nin the global annual CSIFall-daily (Fig. 7).\
    \ This trend is\nclose to the GPP trend derived from the satellite-data-driven\n\
    vegetation\nphotosynthesis\nmodel\n(VPM)\n(0.32 % yr−1)\n(Zhang et al., 2017a)\
    \ but much greater than GPP de-\nrived\nfrom\nother\nremote\nsensing\ndata-driven\n\
    models\n– FLUXCOM (0.01 % yr−1; Tramontana et al., 2016),\nBESS GPP (0.22 % yr−1;\
    \ Jiang and Ryu, 2016), MODIS\nC6 (0.26 % yr−1; Zhao et al., 2005) and WECANN\n\
    (−0.8 % yr−1, affected by the decreasing GOME-2 SIF\ntrend; Zhang et al., 2018b;\
    \ Alemohammad et al., 2017). Con-\nsidering there is no signiﬁcant trend (−0.02\
    \ % yr−1, p>0.1)\nin BESS PAR (Ryu et al., 2018), this increase is likely caused\n\
    by the greening of the Earth (Zhang et al., 2017b; Zhu et al.,\n2016) as captured\
    \ in the MODIS reﬂectance data. This in-\ncreasing trend is also within the range\
    \ of most Earth system\nmodels’ predictions (Anav et al., 2015). We also observed\n\
    a more pronounced increasing trend in the southern Ama-\nzon than when using MODIS\
    \ EVI (Zhang et al., 2017b).\nThis may suggest that CSIF is less likely to suffer\
    \ from high\nbiomass saturation than optical vegetation indices and can\nmore\
    \ effectively detect changes in tropical rainforests or over\nhigh leaf area regions\
    \ such as croplands.\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800, 2018\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\n\

    \ SIF for drought monitoring\nDrought can be categorized into different stages.\
    \ At an early\nstage, when plants sense water deﬁcit in the soil and higher\n\
    vapor pressure deﬁcit in the atmosphere, they reduce water\nloss through stomatal\
    \ closure. This, in turn, also reduces the\nCO2 exchange from stomatal closure\
    \ and inhibits photosyn-\nthesis. The quantum yield for heat dissipation will\
    \ increase\naccompanied by a decrease in quantum yield for photochem-\nical quenching\
    \ and ﬂuorescence (Genty et al., 1989; Porcar-\nCastell et al., 2014). This should\
    \ allow satellites to poten-\ntially capture this decrease in the SIF signal (especially\
    \ dur-\ning the mid-afternoon when stress is more pronounced) as an\nindicator\
    \ of vegetation stress. In the second stage, with pro-\nlonged dry conditions,\
    \ plants will recycle the nitrogen in the\nleaves as represented by a decrease\
    \ of the greenness (chloro-\nphyll content) of leaves. In the third stage, if\
    \ the drought con-\ntinues, leaf senescence and vegetation mortality may follow.\n\
    SIF can potentially detect changes during all those drought\nstages, whereas broadband\
    \ reﬂectance-based indices (NDVI,\nEVI) should only see the second and third stages.\n\
    Previous drought monitoring studies have mostly used\nvegetation indices (VIs)\
    \ as a indictor of drought stress (Ji and\nPeters, 2003; Zhang et al., 2013).\
    \ However, vegetation in-\ndices can only respond to drought changes in the plants’\
    \ op-\ntical properties (mostly during the second and third stages).\nFor most\
    \ plants, there might be a tipping point where plants\nwill not recover from drought-induced\
    \ xylem cavitation (Urli\net al., 2013). Since most VIs (e.g., NDVI, EVI) are\
    \ most\nsensitive to the canopy changes, drought monitoring based\non VIs may\
    \ not be useful for drought mitigation and agri-\ncultural irrigation management.\
    \ SIF retrievals from satellite,\ncompared to optical reﬂectance signals, carry\
    \ the information\nnot only about the PAR absorption by chlorophyll but also\n\
    about the drought stress on plant physiology. Although previ-\nous studies used\
    \ satellite-based SIF datasets for post-drought\nimpact assessment (Lee et al.,\
    \ 2013; Yoshida et al., 2015;\nSun et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016), these studies\
    \ did not\nseparate the contribution of decreased APARchl or deceased\nSIFyield.\
    \ A more recent study compared the SIF and VIs in\nIndia during heat stress (Song\
    \ et al., 2018) and found that\nSIF is more sensitive to heat stress than VIs.\
    \ Similarly, since\nNDVI and EVI cannot well capture the change in chloro-\nphyll\
    \ concentration, heat stress on APARchl and SIFyield can-\nnot be fully separated.\
    \ This study developed a new method\nto compare the difference between SIF signals\
    \ and the re-\nﬂectances, which can be applied for early drought warning\nat global\
    \ scale. Although daily OCO-2 data have large gaps\nbetween swaths, combining\
    \ several days of observation can\nprovide enough spatial coverage considering\
    \ the spatial ex-\ntent for most drought events. The spatial coverage issues\n\
    could be further improved using geostatistical-based meth-\nods (Tadi´c et al.,\
    \ 2017), but this may need further investiga-\ntion. Compared to other meteorological\
    \ drought indices, this\ndrought monitoring technique uses only near real-time\
    \ data\nand avoids the interannual anomalies caused by other fac-\ntors (land\
    \ cover change, crop rotation, etc.). The MCD43C4\ndataset uses 16 days of inputs\
    \ for the model inversion, and al-\nthough this may lead to temporal inconsistencies\
    \ for the com-\nparison between CSIF and OCO-2 SIF, it may have limited\neffect\
    \ due to the higher data quality during drought because\nof the reduced cloud\
    \ coverage.\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800,\

    \ GPP–CSIF\nrelationship\nIn contrast to Sun et al. (2017), we found a large variation\n\
    of GPP–CSIF relationship across sites. Compared to previ-\nous studies, our study\
    \ gave higher aGPP/CSIF estimates, prob-\nably due to a much higher aGPP/CSIF\
    \ value for evergreen\nneedleleaf forest (10 out of 40 sites are ENF) (Table S1\
    \ in\nthe Supplement) and slight underestimation of CSIFall-daily\ndataset. This\
    \ higher aGPP/CSIF value for ENF was also sug-\ngested by the comparison between\
    \ OCO-2 SIF and FLUX-\nCOM GPP dataset (Sun et al., 2018) and other comparisons\n\
    using GOSAT SIF (Guanter et al., 2012). Consistent with\nLi et al. (2018b), we\
    \ also found small cross-biome variation\nof the GPP–SIF relationship. However,\
    \ a large within-biome\nvariation of aGPP/CSIF is also found, which contributes\
    \ to a\nlarge proportion of the observed cross-site variations rather\nthan the\
    \ cross-biome variation. Compared to studies that use\nOCO-SIF within a large\
    \ buffering area (e.g., 40 km diameter\ncircle in Verma et al., 2017), we made\
    \ the comparison over a\nmuch smaller area and much higher temporal frequency.\n\
    There are several explanations for the observed site-\nspeciﬁc GPP–SIF relationship.\
    \ (1) Leaf morphology may di-\nrectly affect the reabsorption and scattering of\
    \ SIF that leaves\nthe foliage (Atherton et al., 2017); however, this factor is\
    \ not\nconsidered in current SIF modeling (van der Tol et al., 2009;\nVerrelst\
    \ et al., 2015) and will directly affect the model sim-\nulation of the GPP–SIF\
    \ relationship at the ecosystem scale\n(Verrelst et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016c).\
    \ (2) Vegetation\ncanopy characteristics also affect the reabsorption and scat-\n\

    \ canopy (Romero et al., 2018;\nYang and van der Tol, 2018). (3) Atmospheric condition\
    \ may\nattenuate and bias satellite SIF retrievals to some extent, but\nthis effect\
    \ is assumed to be small unless thick clouds are\npresent (Frankenberg and Berry,\
    \ 2017). (4) SIF and GPP\nlikely have different sensitivities to environmental\
    \ stresses\n(Flexas et al., 2002); therefore, ecosystems with frequent en-\nvironmental\
    \ stresses (e.g., drought) during the growing sea-\nson tend to have relatively\
    \ lower GPP-to-SIF ratio. (5) Since\nlight saturations have less effect on SIF\
    \ than GPP (Damm et\nal., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016c), the growing-season averaged\n\
    light intensity (affected by latitude, average cloud coverage),\nvegetation canopy\
    \ structure and leaf characteristics that re-\nlate to the light saturation will\
    \ also affect GPP–SIF rela-\ntionship. For example, the evergreen needleleaf forests\
    \ have\nmuch higher speciﬁc leaf area and usually lower Sun zenith\nangle, making\
    \ them less prone to light saturation. These fac-\ntors may vary not only across\
    \ biomes but also across sites.\nTherefore, within one biome type, the GPP–SIF\
    \ relationship\ncan also be different.\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\n\
    Biogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800, 2018\n5794\nY. Zhang et al.: A global spatially\
    \ contiguous solar-induced ﬂuorescence dataset\nIt is also noteworthy that clear-sky\
    \ daily SIF exhibited\nstronger correlation with GPP (Fig. 13); a possible explana-\n\
    tion would be that the light-use efﬁciency increases with dif-\nfused radiation,\
    \ which partly compensates for the decrease\nin incoming PAR when clouds are present\
    \ (Gu et al., 2002;\nTurner et al., 2006). Because the satellite SIF retrieval\
    \ al-\ngorithm discarded observations that were affected by thick\nclouds (Sun\
    \ et al., 2018), the SIF retrievals from OCO-2\nare more positively biased than\
    \ the actual SIF emission of\nthe plants. However, during periods when thick clouds\
    \ are\npresent, the LUE also increases and so does the GPP / SIF\nratio. The positive\
    \ SIF retrieval biases compensated the in-\ncrease in the GPP / SIF ratio and\
    \ therefore contributed to\na stronger correlation between satellite-retrieved\
    \ SIF (rather\nthan the actual SIF emission) and GPP.\n4.4\nUncertainties and\
    \ caveats\nAlthough our CSIFclear-inst showed good performance as sup-\nported\
    \ by the comparison with the clear-sky instantaneous\nSIF retrievals from OCO-2,\
    \ the CSIFall-daily exhibits a slight\nunderestimation. A possible explanation\
    \ is that most SIF re-\ntrievals during overcast conditions did not pass the quality\n\
    checks, such that OCO-2 SIF are more likely obtained dur-\ning clear-sky conditions.\
    \ This is supported by the fact that if\nwe compare OCO-2 SIF with clear-daily\
    \ SIF, the R2 is even\nhigher (Fig. 6).\nThe canopy structure and sun-sensor geometry\
    \ were not\nexplicitly considered in our modeling and only implicitly\nembedded\
    \ in the machine learning retrieval. Several recent\nstudies suggest that canopy\
    \ structure will affect the PAR ab-\nsorption and re-absorption of SIF before\
    \ leaving the canopy\n(fesc in Eq. 3) (Knyazikhin et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang\nand van der Tol, 2018) and further affect the GPP–SIF rela-\ntionship\
    \ (He et al., 2017; Migliavacca et al., 2017; Zhang et\nal., 2016c). However,\
    \ most of these studies made assump-\ntions requiring either a dense canopy or\
    \ non-reﬂecting soil\nand thus cannot be easily applied at the global scale. In\
    \ ad-\ndition, OCO-2 SIF data used in this study are from nadir ob-\nservations,\
    \ while both the MODIS and GOME-2 sensors ac-\nquire images both at nadir and\
    \ near nadir. Such discrepancy\nin observation angles may induce bidirectional\
    \ effects. Since\nCSIF is trained based on the satellite-observed SIF instead\n\
    of the canopy SIF emission, and as previously discussed, it\ndid not consider\
    \ the atmospheric attenuation of SIF signal in\nthe presence of clouds. The CSIF\
    \ values are expected to be\ncloser to the canopy SIF emission than the satellite-observed\n\
    SIF at the top of atmosphere.\nThe BESS PAR 4-day dataset has high overall accuracy\n\
    (RRMSE of 15.2 %) and very little bias (1.4 %). For differ-\nent climate zones,\
    \ the uncertainties are typically under 20 %.\nThese uncertainties do not affect\
    \ the CSIFclear-inst data but\nwill propagate to CSIFall-daily.\n5\nConclusions\n\
    In this study, using the surface reﬂectance from the MODIS\ninstrument and a NN\
    \ algorithm, we developed two spa-\ntially contiguous and high-temporal-resolution\
    \ SIF datasets\n(CSIF). These two SIF products not only show high accuracy\nwhen\
    \ validated against the satellite-retrieved OCO-2 SIF but\nalso exhibit reasonably\
    \ high consistency with both recon-\nstructed and satellite-retrieved GOME-2 SIF.\
    \ CSIFall-daily ex-\nhibits an increasing trend globally during 2001–2016, which\n\
    is attributed to the Earth greening and not to changes in PAR.\nSince the CSIF\
    \ dataset includes most information on PAR ab-\nsorption of chlorophyll, the difference\
    \ between OCO-2 SIF\nand CSIF mostly contains the information on physiological\n\
    stress on ﬂuorescence yield. This indicator is found to be\nmore effective for\
    \ early drought warning than vegetation in-\ndices. By comparing CSIFall-daily\
    \ with GPP estimates across\n40 EC ﬂux tower sites, the GPP–SIF relationship is\
    \ found\nto vary across sites, and a large proportion of this comes\nfrom within-biome\
    \ variation. However, this ﬁnding still re-\nquires further examination using\
    \ SIF from both new satel-\nlites instruments (e.g., TROPOMI) and ground-based\
    \ mea-\nsurements. The high-resolution CSIF dataset can be further\nused for regional\
    \ to global carbon and water ﬂux analysis.\nCode availability. The code used to\
    \ generate the CSIF dataset is\navailable at https://github.com/zhangyaonju/ (Zhang\

    Rsb and Rsd are calculated as the product of the top-of-\natmosphere shortwave\
    \ radiation (RTOA) and the atmospheric\ntransmittance for beam radiation (τb)\

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    Get rights and content Abstract Monthly data records of 40 Iranian stations distributed
    over the country, for the period 1971–2005, were utilized for estimation of reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) using Penman–Monteith (PM-ETo), Hargreaves–Samani (HS)
    and FAO-PM temperature (PMT) methods. To estimate ETo with HS and PMT methods,
    appropriate kRs, an empirical radiation adjustment coefficient, were considered
    for each station, whereas Tmin was adjusted for estimation of Tdew and used only
    for PMT computation. It was found that the appropriate kRs for both HS and PMT
    methods are identical for a given station and it is generally smaller in sub-humid
    and humid than in semi-arid to hyper-arid climates. The performance of the PMT
    was further improved in both arid and humid climates when Tmin was adjusted. The
    result suggested that the HS and PMT methods appropriately predict ETo for all
    climatic regions of Iran if the appropriate kRs was utilized. However, the considered
    methods showed weak performances for some stations in arid and hyper-arid climates
    of eastern and southern Iran owing to the effect of extreme and variable wind
    speed inherent in the PM-ETo. Thus, the role played by wind speed in ETo estimation
    was examined; the result indicated that the existence of extreme winds, and also
    the time variability of wind speed, is responsible for the observed discrepancies
    between PMT and PM-ETo estimates. The spatial patterns of ETo computed with HS
    and PMT methods found to be identical and resemble to that of PM-ETo, all showing
    a gradual increasing from north to south, with the lowest ETo values observed
    over northern humid and sub-humid climates of Iran and larger ETo for arid and
    hyper-arid climates in the southern and eastern country. Results indicated that
    the HS and PMT methods are appropriate alternatives for estimation of ETo for
    all climatic regions of Iran. Highlights ► Appropriate kRs was used for estimation
    of ETo with HS and PMT methods. ► Using adjusted Tmin in PMT model improved its
    estimates in arid and humid climates. ► Appropriate kRs for both HS and PMT found
    to be identical for a given station. ► Appropriate kRs found to be smaller in
    humid than in arid climates. ► The HS and PMT methods appropriately predict ETo
    for all climatic regions of Iran. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction Adequate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is of
    paramount importance in agricultural and hydrological studies, water resources
    management and watershed management. In particular, it is required for estimation
    of crop water requirements, supporting irrigation scheduling, drought management
    and climate change studies. The methodologies of ETo estimation redefined by Food
    and Agricultural Organization of United Nations (FAO) were successfully applied
    at different time scales in various climatic regions of the world (Allen et al.,
    1998, Allen et al., 2006, Smith, 2000). The Penman–Monteith ETo (PM-ETo) equation
    refers to grass as reference crop and requires solar radiation data or sunshine
    duration for estimating net radiation (Rn), maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax
    and Tmin, respectively), psycrometric or relative humidity data for estimating
    the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed (U) When formulating the PM-ETo
    equation advection effects were not considered (Allen et al., 1998, Pereira et
    al., 1999). Advection impacts on crop evapotranspiration must be considered through
    the crop coefficients and not ETo (Allen et al., 1998). However, when searching
    for ETo data estimation under advective conditions, Berengena and Gavilán (2005)
    found that daily ETo estimates using the PM-ETo equation matched well the lysimeter
    observations of grass ET. Good results are reported for daily computations using
    hourly data in locations having advective influences (Allen et al., 2006). To
    appropriately compute the parameters of PM-ETo the procedures proposed by Allen
    et al. (1998) should be followed. Alternative procedures have been tested by Nandagiri
    and Kovoor (2005), who have shown the need for strict adherence to the recommended
    parameter computation procedures, especially for estimating vapour pressure deficit
    and net radiation parameters. Gavilán et al. (2007) reported that the methods
    proposed by Allen et al. (1998) for estimating Rn and G are appropriate for estimation
    of ETo for both daily and hourly time scales. Gong et al. (2006) performed a sensitivity
    analysis of PM-ETo parameters and pointed to the very high influence of solar
    radiation and relative humidity in accurate estimation of PM-ETo. However, lack
    of full weather datasets in many parts of the world, particularly in remote areas,
    limits the application of PM-ETo. Thus, alternative accurate approaches requiring
    limited data are needed, which has led to a huge number of related studies focusing
    various climates. According to Allen et al. (1998), and basing upon former studies
    to compare the performance of ET temperature methods, mainly the study by Jensen
    et al. (1990), when full weather data are lacking ETo can be estimated either
    using the empirical Hargreaves–Samani (HS) equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985),
    or empirically estimating Rn, VPD and U for using in the PM-ETo equation, including
    through using data from neighbour weather stations (Allen, 1997). Various ET temperature
    methods were then excluded – and consequently are not considered in this study
    –, particularly the ET climatic equation of Thornthwaite (1948), that largely
    underestimates grass ETo comparatively to PM-ETo (Allen et al., 1994). In both
    aforementioned methods the minimum set of data required consists of Tmax and Tmin.
    The latter approach for using the PM-ETo with only Tmax and Tmin is called herein
    as PM temperature (PMT) method and is also referred in literature as reduced set
    PM method (e.g., Martinez and Thepadia, 2010). Both the HS and PMT methods have
    received a continuous attention from research contrarily to the use of neighbour
    weather data; however, a recent methodology based on principal component analysis
    to estimate ETo when no local climatic inputs are available (Martí and Zarzo,
    2012) may provide new developments in this domain. The ETo estimated by the HS
    equation have been successfully compared with the ETo computed with the PM-ETo
    equation using full datasets, or with grass lysimeter data, indicating that the
    HS method performs well in most climatic regions, with the exception of humid
    area where it tends to overestimate ETo (Nandagiri and Kovoor, 2006, Trajkovic
    and Kolakovic, 2009, Martinez and Thepadia, 2010, Tabari, 2010). Since the HS
    method was empirically developed based on data from arid to sub-humid environments,
    it may not fit well to conditions far different from those considered for its
    calibration as it is the case for humid climates. Temesgen et al. (2005) also
    stated that the HS method underestimates ETo for dry and windy locations due to
    not considering a wind factor and concluded that it is more accurate when applied
    for 5 or 7-day averages than for daily time scales. However, despite a quite good
    performance of the HS equation in most applications, particularly when it is used
    for irrigation scheduling purposes, many authors attempted to recalibrate the
    HS coefficients or parameters in order to improve its performance (e.g., Droogers
    and Allen, 2002, Trajkovic, 2007, Fooladmand et al., 2008), or to modify the equation
    itself (Diodato and Bellocchi, 2007). This resulted in a large number of versions
    of the HS equation, that relates with the purpose of many researchers to find
    locally calibrated versions of the HS equation. Based on a careful analysis of
    the history and applications of the HS equation, Hargreaves and Allen (2003) concluded
    that recalibrating the exponents and coefficients of the HS equation only increased
    the complexity of the equation. The HS method is usually preferred with respective
    to other more complicated equations since it is reasonably adequate and requires
    only maximum and minimum air temperatures (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003). This is
    very important in regions where solar radiation, air humidity, and wind speed
    data are lacking or are of low or questionable quality, while the maximum and
    minimum air temperatures are available in most of agro-climatic and weather stations
    since air temperature can be measured with less errors and by less trained individuals
    than the other required climate variables used in combination equations. The accuracy
    of the PMT equation has been assessed by several authors through comparing its
    results with those of the PM-ETo or other ET equations, HS included. Popova et
    al. (2006) found more accurate results for PMT than for HS, which tended to overestimate
    ETo in the Trace plain area of southern Bulgaria. For Pyrenees, López-Moreno et
    al. (2009) obtained better results with PMT when compared with HS method. Similarly,
    Jabloun and Sahli (2008) found better estimates for PMT than for HS in Northern
    and Central Tunisia. An application of PMT for Northern China, characterized with
    monsoon climate, also have shown that the PMT estimates better fitted to the PM-ETo
    than HS (Liu and Pereira, 2001, Pereira et al., 2003). Application of PMT to different
    climates of South Africa showed to be superior to HS and that better results were
    obtained when applied to 5-day rather than daily time scales (Annandale et al.,
    2002). The estimated ETo computed by PMT and HS method for Serbia suggested that
    PMT fitted better PM-ETo than HS (Trajkovic, 2005). Differently, it was found
    that the HS produced smaller overestimation errors than PMT in a humid climate
    (Martinez and Thepadia, 2010). Kra (2010) applied a modified PMT method in West
    Africa, while Cai et al. (2007) used a modified PMT approach for estimating ETo
    with daily forecast messages; lately, the PMT was adapted for using daily forecasted
    weather data for irrigation scheduling purposes (Cai et al., 2009). Paredes and
    Rodrigues (2010) found small errors with PMT relative to HS, thus adopting it
    to estimate ETo in Portugal for irrigation scheduling purposes; they found that
    estimation errors were larger in humid locations comparative to dryer ones. Gocic
    and Trajkovic (2010) proposed a software to estimate ETo for minimizing computation
    errors using the PMT or an adjusted HS equation when weather data are missing.
    However, current literature show that there are no attempts to calibrate the radiation
    adjustment coefficient kRs used to estimate solar radiation from the temperature
    difference in PMT and, non-explicitly, in HS (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003, Samani,
    2000, Samani, 2004). This calibration is therefore a line to be explored in this
    study. Moreover, literature looks to be controversial when comparing HS and PMT
    results as was identified by Todorovic et al. (2013). Due to the complex orography
    and wide latitudinal extent, Iran contains diverse climates ranging from very
    humid in the Caspian Sea region to arid and hyper arid in the central, southern
    and eastern Iran. In this vast area, the stations recording the climate variables
    needed for estimation of PM-ETo are very sparse and in many cases have incomplete
    records, particularly in the central-southern country where the Iranian deserts
    are situated. Therefore, to have a reliable estimation of ETo at a fine spatial
    resolution over the country, it is important to use accurate methods requiring
    limited weather data that can be available in a dense network through the country
    as it is the case for temperature. To our best knowledge, Dinpashoh (2006) is
    the only author that has estimated ETo for the whole country using PM-ETo and
    HS methods, but did not tested the possible advantages in using calibrated values
    for the radiation adjustment coefficient or temperature adjustment for dew point
    temperature estimation for the PMT method as proposed by Allen (1996). The adequateness
    of using PM-ETo in Iran is also demonstrated by Dinpashoh et al. (2011) through
    a trend analysis of PM-ETo for 16 Iranian weather stations. Several authors have
    also assessed the application of other methods requiring minimum data for estimation
    of ETo in some parts of Iran rather than for the whole country (Fooladmand and
    Haghighat, 2007, Ahmadi and Fooladmand, 2008, Rahimikhoob, 2010, Tabari et al.,
    2011a, Tabari and Aghajanloo, 2012). However, a calibration of the radiation adjustment
    coefficient was not attempted in any of the later referred studies and the PMT
    and HS methods were not compared. Therefore, the objective of the present study
    is to evaluate the potential and accuracy of the PMT and HS methods for estimation
    of ETo in different climatic regions of Iran and to refine the methodologies for
    better adapting both the PMT and HS methods to the existing environmental conditions.
    Thus, it is aimed to compare the PMT and HS methods, to find the best values for
    the radiation adjustment coefficient to be used with both methods, to assess the
    advantage in correcting the minimum temperature when estimating VPD, and to assess
    the impacts of high wind speed in arid zones. These objectives are set to support
    a wide range of irrigation management and water resources applications, particularly
    relative to droughts, for use in regions where weather data are missing, are incomplete
    or are of questionable quality. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data The data used
    for this study are monthly averages of maximum and minimum temperature (°C), relative
    humidity (%), sunshine duration (h) and wind speed (m s−1) relative to 40 Iranian
    synoptic stations distributed over the country as depicted in Fig. 1a; the associated
    coordinates are shown in Table 1. The majority of the selected stations have the
    longest and nearly complete data records for the period 1971–2005, particularly
    considering sunshine, relative humidity and wind speed data. The selected stations
    are first order synoptic stations that passed careful quality control by the Iranian
    meteorological organization and are quite regularly distributed through the country
    (Fig. 1a). However, the time series of the considered variables were further investigated
    for possible non-homogeneities by comparing the time series of a given station
    with those of neighbouring stations. The result proved that all the variables
    were homogeneous, with the exception of wind speed records at Tabass, Bam, Semnan,
    Kashan, Khoramabad, Dezful and Chabahar stations, which exhibited extreme step
    changes and non-homogeneity. Therefore, the wind datasets at these 7 stations
    were corrected through establishing linear regression between the considered station
    data and those of neighbouring stations as proposed by Allen et al. (1998). Download

    for the present study encompass several representative stations for each climatic
    sub-region of Iran, defined herein on the basis of the global aridity index (UNEP,
    1997) adopted by the United-Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The
    UNEP aridity index, which is also adopted by FAO and used worldwide consists of
    the ratio of mean annual precipitation (P) to mean annual potential evapotranspiration
    computed with the Thornthwaite method (Thornthwaite, 1948). The computed aridity
    index for the considered stations are also presented in Table 1 to climatically
    characterize the used stations, while the spatial distribution of the index over
    the country is depicted in Fig. 1b. The map of aridity index points to the humid
    and sub-humid climates over coastal areas of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran.
    Dry-sub-humid climate features occur in the highest parts of the Alborz mountain
    chain in the north, thus acting as a transitional band, isolating humid and sub-humid
    climates of the coastal areas of the Caspian Sea from the semi-arid areas of interior
    Iran (Fig. 1b). The dry-sub-humid climate also characterizes a remarkable part
    of western Iran due to its relatively high annual precipitation accompanied with
    cold winters and moderate summers. Semi-arid climates refer to the mountainous
    areas of western, northern and north-eastern Iran, whereas arid and hyper-arid
    climates dominate central, southern and eastern Iran (Fig. 1b). The climate sub-regions
    of Iran produced herein based on the spatial variability of the aridity index,
    though methodologically and conceptually different, are in relatively good agreement
    with the results of the precipitation based regionalization studies for Iran in
    illustrating the main structure of the Iranian climate (e.g., Dinpashoh et al.,
    2004, Raziei et al., 2008). 2.2. Methods to estimate ETo The PM-ETo equation is
    aimed to define the grass reference evapotranspiration, i.e., the rate of evapotranspiration
    from a hypothetical crop with an assumed fixed height (12 cm), surface resistance
    (70 s m−1) and albedo (0.23), approximately resembling the evapotranspiration
    from an extensive surface of a disease-free green grass cover of uniform height,
    actively growing, completely shading the ground, and with adequate water and nutrient
    supply (Allen et al., 1998). The PM-ETo equation for calculation of daily ETo
    takes the form: (1) where ETo is the grass reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1),
    Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is soil heat flux
    density (MJ m−2 day−1), T is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height (°C), u2
    is wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1), es is saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea
    is actual vapor pressure (kPa), es − ea is vapor pressure deficit (kPa), Δ is
    slope of the vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), and γ is psychometric constant (kPa
    °C−1). This equation uses standard meteorological records of solar radiation or
    sunshine duration, minimum and maximum air temperature, air humidity and wind
    speed. To ensure the integrity of computations, the weather measurements should
    be made at 2 m (or converted to that height) above an extensive surface of green
    grass, shading the ground and not short of water. The parameters of Eq. (1) can
    be estimated from the observed climatic variables following the standard methods
    proposed by Allen et al. (1998), whereas the missing climatic data can be estimated
    empirically as follows. Rn is computed as the algebraic sum of the net short and
    long wave radiation (Rns and Rnl, respectively). Rns, results from the balance
    between incoming and reflected solar radiation (Rs) adopting an albedo of 0.23,
    and Rnl results from the balance between the down-coming and the outgoing long
    wave radiation emitted by the vegetation and the soil. Computations were performed
    as proposed by Allen et al. (1998). When Rs is not measured, it can be estimated
    from the observed duration of sunshine hours with the Angström (1924) equation:
    (2) where Rs is solar or shortwave radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), n is actual sunshine
    duration (h), N is maximum possible sunshine duration (h), n/N is relative sunshine
    duration, Ra is extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), as is the coefficient
    expressing the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on overcast
    days (n = 0), and as + bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching
    the earth on clear sky days (n = N). Ra and N are computed for any given day as
    a function of the latitude of the site (Allen et al., 1998). When using monthly
    time steps Ra and N are computed for the central day of the month. The values
    as = 0.25 and bs = 0.50 are recommended when these fractions are not locally calibrated
    using a set of good quality data on both n/N and Rs. When radiation and sunshine
    duration measurements are not available, the PMT method uses the Hargreaves radiation
    equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982) for the estimation of solar radiation (Rs)
    in alternative to Eq. (2): (3) where kRs is the empirical radiation adjustment
    coefficient (°C−0.5). For ‘interior’ locations, where land mass dominates and
    air masses are not strongly influenced by a large water body, Allen (1997) and
    Allen et al. (1998) proposed kRs ≅ 0.16 for ‘interior’ areas and kRs ≅ 0.19 for
    ‘coastal’ locations. These values are the same as those proposed previously by
    Hargreaves (1994). Inherent to its empirical nature, there is some uncertainty
    relatively to this coefficient (Samani, 2004). Popova et al. (2006) reported that
    for temperate climate kRs values change little. Differently, for a wide range
    of climates as in the Mediterranean countries a large variation was observed (Todorovic
    et al., 2013). Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is computed as the difference between
    the saturation vapour pressure (es) and the actual vapour pressure (ea). es is
    computed as the average of the saturation vapour pressure at Tmax and Tmin. Various
    approximations may be used to estimate ea depending upon available data. When
    only mean daily relative humidity (RHmean) data are available, as for the complete
    datasets used in this study, ea is computed as (Allen et al., 1998): (4) In the
    absence of humidity data, ea may be obtained by assuming that the dew point temperature,
    Tdew, is close to the daily minimum temperature, Tmin. Then, if the weather station
    can be considered a reference site where Tdew = Tmin, ea is calculated by (5)
    The HS method (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) requires only observed Tmin and Tmax
    for the estimation of ETo (mm day−1), which is given as: (6) where Ra is the extraterrestrial
    radiation as defined earlier, and λ is the latent heat of vaporization (MJ kg−1)
    for the mean air temperature T (°C), that is commonly assumed equal to 2.45 MJ
    kg−1. 0.0135 is a factor for conversion from American to the International system
    of units and kRs is the radiation adjustment coefficient defined in Eq. (3). In
    the common version of HS equation the value kRs ≅ 0.17 is used (Samani, 2004).
    2.3. Temperature adjustment for estimating PMT-ETo Data quality assessment and
    data correction for non-reference weather sites, i.e., where aridity is dominant,
    were proposed by Allen et al. (1998) as a pre-condition for accuracy of PM-ETo
    calculations. In fact, the PM-ETo definition implies the consideration of an actively
    growing grass crop completely shading the ground and not short of water. However,
    many, if not the majority of the weather data around the globe are reported from
    non-reference sites, and their use to estimate ETo may cause less accuracy of
    estimates. If data quality is essential for any kind of evapotranspiration studies
    (Allen et al., 2011), requirements for aridity corrections relate specifically
    with the PM-ETo equation and crop reference definition. That correction was analyzed
    by Allen (1996), Jensen et al. (1997) and Temesgen et al. (1999), and refers to
    correct temperature by 2 or 3 degrees to approach Tmin of Tdew when the site temperature
    is higher than that expected for a reference site while air humidity is lower.
    Temesgen et al. (1999) have shown small effects of this correction on ETo estimated
    with the HS equation because this equation does not explicitly use dew point temperature
    and wind speed, both of which are affected by site aridity. These authors also
    considered that where the aridity of the site increases it mixes up the top and
    bottom layers of the atmosphere. The mixing of different layers in turn reduces
    the temperature range (TR = Tmax − Tmin) by decreasing Tmax during daytime and
    by increasing Tmin during night-time, thereby keeping the increase in estimated
    ETo lower than that for PM-ETo as aridity increases. The humidity term is only
    implicitly contained in the TR term of the Hargreaves equation. The analysis by
    Hargreaves and Allen (2003) agrees with the hypothesis of Temesgen et al. (1999),
    thus not considering the need for site aridity correction when the HS equation
    is used. The PMT method uses as input only measured minimum and maximum air temperature
    for the estimation of ETo by the PM-ETo equation (Eq. (1)), whereas wind speed
    is fixed to 2 m s−1 (the average value of 2000 weather stations over the globe)
    and solar radiation and actual vapour pressure are estimated by Eqs. (3), (5),
    respectively (Allen et al., 1998, Popova et al., 2006). As discussed before, when
    applying the PMT method there is a need for adjustment of temperature used for
    the estimation of actual vapour pressure. Tmin might be greater than Tdew in a
    non-reference weather station, as for a station located inside a town or having
    dry or bare ground. Then, the estimated value for Tdew from Tmin may require correction
    (Allen, 1996, Allen et al., 1998, Temesgen et al., 1999), which is expected to
    be higher in more arid climates. Considering the climate zones defined in Table
    2 and illustrated in Fig. 1b, the corrections of Tdew are proposed for all months
    where P/ETo < 0.65 (Todorovic et al., 2013). Table 2. Correction of Tdew estimates
    from Tmin for estimation of actual vapor pressure. Climate zones Annual P/ETo
    Corrected Tdew (°C) Hyper-arid <0.08 Tdew = Tmin − 4 Arid 0.08–0.20 Tdew = Tmin
    − 2 Semi-arid 0.20–0.50 Tdew = Tmin − 1 Dry sub-humid 0.50–0.65 Tdew = Tmin −
    1 Moist sub-humid 0.65–1.0 No correction for aridity Humid >1.0 No correction
    for aridity Differently, in humid climate where commonly air humidity is high
    and temperatures are relatively low, very likely Tdew is higher or much higher
    than Tmin. Therefore, for the humid stations situated in the Caspian Sea region,
    considering the relations for Tdew in moist air proposed by Lawrence (2005), and
    following the good results previously obtained for the Mediterranean area (Todorovic
    et al., 2013), Tdew was estimated as follows: (7) with ad = 2 °C for the months
    when 0.8 < P/ETo < 1.0 and ad = 1 °C if P/ETo > 1.0. 2.4. Evaluation procedure
    A trial and error procedure was applied to all datasets to find the best values
    for kRs since the relations proposed by Samani, 2000, Samani, 2004 did not show
    to be appropriate. PMT computations were performed with temperature correction
    for aridity effects (Table 2) or for humidity impacts on Tdew as described in
    Section 2.3. The results of ETo estimated by PMT and HS methods using limited
    weather data were compared with those of reference PM-ETo computed using full
    datasets. To assess the performance of HS and PMT methods with respect to PM-ETo,
    relative to all pairs of observed and predicted values for each station, in addition
    to a linear regression forced to the origin, several statistical indicators were
    also used. These indicators are explained below and their equations are given
    in literature, e.g., the comparative study of ETo models by Todorovic et al. (2013).
    If the coefficient of regression b is close to 1 then the predicted values are
    statistically close to the observed ones; when the coefficient of determination
    R2 is close to 1.0 then most of the variation of the observed values can be explained
    by the model. The root mean square error, RMSE characterizes the variance of the
    errors; the smaller RMSE the better is the model''s performance. The modelling
    efficiency, EF, was used to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance
    comparatively to the measured data variance; it is defined from the ratio of the
    mean square error to the variance in the observed data (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970,
    Moriasi et al., 2007). EF indicates that when the residual variance equals the
    observed data variance it results EF = 1.0; contrarily, when EF equals zero or
    is negative this indicates that the observed mean is as good or better predictor
    than the model. The Willmott (1981) index of agreement, dIA, is also a non-dimensional
    measure that represents the ratio between the mean square error and the “potential
    error”, defined as the sum of the squared absolute values of the distances from
    the predicted values to the mean observed value and distances from the observed
    values to the mean observed value (Moriasi et al., 2007): dIA varies between 0
    and 1; a value of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between the measured and predicted
    values while 0 indicates no agreement at all (Moriasi et al., 2007). The above
    statistics measure the degree of accuracy of ETo estimation using PMT and HS methods
    with respect to the PM-ETo, however not giving information whether the accuracy
    between the two competing models is significantly different. To address this issue,
    a test statistic proposed by Diebold and Mariano (1995), which is commonly used
    in financial literature, is adopted. Although this test is usually used for out-of-sample
    forecasting accuracy analysis (Mohammadi and Su, 2010), here it is used to test
    the accuracy of within-sample prediction following Modarres and Ouarda (2012),
    who recently applied it in hydrological sciences. In the present study, the test
    can indicate if there is a significant difference between PMT and HS''s performances
    in estimating ETo. Formally, let e1,t and e2,t, t = 1, …, m, denote model errors
    from PMT an HS models and g(e1,t) and g(e2,t) are their associated loss functions,
    i.e., the squared-error loss, and dt = g(e1,t) − g(e2,t) is the loss differential,
    then the B statistics (Diebold and Mariano, 1995) is defined as: (8) where is
    the sample mean, s is the variance of loss differential and m is the number of
    observations. Given covariance stationarity and short memory with regard to dt,
    the test implies an asymptotic distribution with zero mean and unit variance.
    Under a null hypothesis of zero mean, the two models have equal accuracy if the
    loss differential has zero expectation for all t observations. The null hypothesis
    is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis when the statistic B, in absolute
    value, exceeds the critical value of a standard unit Gaussian distribution (Diebold
    and Mariano, 1995). 3. Results 3.1. Performance of HS method The performance of
    the HS method is evaluated against the computed PM-ETo in all considered stations
    (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Fig. 2 illustrates the relationship between PM-ETo and HS
    estimates when appropriate kRs were used for all the stations. In Table 3, in
    addition to the goodness of fit indicators, the appropriate kRs utilized for computing
    HS for each of the considered stations are also given. Download : Download full-size

    estimated HS strongly correlates with PM-ETo at most of the stations, implying
    that the HS method appropriately predicts the PM-ETo in all climatic regions of
    Iran when the appropriate kRs is selected. A visual inspection in Fig. 2 and Table
    3 suggests that the HS method performs well for all climatic zones of Iran shown
    in Fig. 1b, particularly for the stations characterized with semi arid to humid
    climates in western and northern Iran. The HS estimates for the stations located
    in the central-southern and eastern arid to hyper-arid climates of Iran show also
    a satisfactory agreement with PM-ETo, though a very poor agreement was found for
    Zabol in eastern Iran. A slighter deviation of the HS estimation from the PM-ETo
    for higher ET values was also observed for some other stations characterized with
    semi-arid to hyper-arid climates though are reasonably in good agreement. The
    observed deviation in such stations, particularly for extreme values, is supposed
    to be related to the effect of wind speed on PM-ETo computation that is addressed
    in Section 3.4. Good results for humid climates (Fig. 2 and Table 3) are contradicting
    findings by many authors (e.g., Trajkovic and Kolakovic, 2009, Martinez and Thepadia,
    2010, Tabari, 2010) and result from the calibration of kRs, which was apparently
    not achieved by the referred authors. Fig. 3a illustrates the spatial pattern
    of kRs appropriate for estimation of ETo using the HS method. The appropriate
    kRs for the stations located in the dry-sub-humid to humid climates of western
    and northern Iran found to be between 0.13 and 0.18, while it ranges from 0.14
    to 0.20 for the stations situated in the semi-arid to hyper-arid climates of central,
    southern and eastern Iran. The figure depicts a gradual increasing in kRs moving
    from north to south and from west to east, being relatively in concordance of
    the climatic zones of Iran depicted in Fig. 1. However, the spatial configuration
    of the kRs is interrupted by some eyeballs, particularly in northern half of the
    country, wherever the kRs values are far different from the surrounding values.
    In other words, there are a few cases where the appropriate kRs for a single station
    differs from the general pattern of the region. For example the best fitted kRs
    for Tabriz, in north-western Iran, is 0.21, which is much higher than the norm
    of the region, which could be attributed to the local high summer wind speed.
    Contrasting, kRs is 0.15 for Kashan, in central Iran, which is lower than the
    general kRs pattern for arid and hyper-arid climates. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Spatial patterns of the selected kRs over Iran for: (a) HS and (b)
    PMT methods. The performance of the HS method in relation to the PM-ETo was assessed
    through a set of goodness of fit indicators (Table 3). These statistics indicate
    that the HS method satisfactorily predicts ETo in most of the stations, which
    is supported by R2 higher than 0.90 and the regression coefficient b between 0.98
    and 1.02 in approximately 85% of the stations. The RMSE is lower than 0.70 and
    0.50 mm d−1 in 90% and 63% of the stations, respectively. These results are supported
    with the modelling efficiency (EF), larger than 0.95 and the index of agreement
    (dIA) higher than 0.99 in approximately 90% of stations. Differently, larger errors
    of estimate and lower goodness of fit indicators were obtained for Zabol, Abadan,
    Torbat, Birjand, Bandarabas, Sabzevar and Mashad, where the variance of the residuals
    of the estimation is high and does not respond to the required homoscedasticity,
    probably due to lack of considering wind speed within the HS method. 3.2. Performance
    of the PMT method The performance of the PMT method against the PM-ETo in all
    considered stations were also evaluated graphically (Fig. 4) and statistically
    (Table 4). Tmin was corrected for all considered stations in semi-arid to hyper-arid
    climates (Table 2) in order to better estimate Tdew for PMT computation. For humid
    climates, Tdew was differently estimated with Eq. (7). A trial and error procedure
    was adopted to search for the appropriate kRs used for computation of PMT, their
    values are indicated in Fig. 4 and Table 4. For some stations, as analyzed in
    Section 3.4, wind speed corrections were also adopted. Download : Download full-size

    4, the estimated PMT strongly correlate linearly with PM-ETo in most of the stations,
    implying that the PMT appropriately predicts the PM-ETo in all climatic zones
    of Iran. Fig. 4 suggests that the PMT particularly performs well for the stations
    characterized with semi arid to humid climates of western and northern Iran. The
    PMT also performs reasonably well in humid climate of the Caspian Sea region in
    the north, where Tdew was computed with Eq. (7), which allowed to consider the
    effect of high air humidity. The estimated PMT for most of the stations located
    in the central-southern and eastern arid and hyper-arid climates of Iran show
    also satisfactory agreement with PM-ETo, though relatively weak association were
    found for Abadan, Torbat, Birjand, Chabahar and, mainly, for Zabol station (Fig.
    4 and Table 4). All these stations also performed poorly for the HS method. The
    stations located in western and northern dry-sub-humid to humid climates of Iran
    have kRs between 0.10 and 0.18, while kRs varies from 0.11 to 0.20 for the stations
    situated in the semi-arid to hyper-arid regions of central-eastern Iran (Table
    4 and Fig. 3b). As was the case for the HS method, there are some cases where
    the selected kRs for a station differs from the regional pattern, e.g., the selected
    kRs for Tabriz station in north-western Iran is much higher than the kRs values
    of the surrounding stations. Fig. 3b shows the spatial pattern of kRs used for
    estimation of PMT over Iran, depicting a pattern very similar of that for the
    HS method in Fig. 3a. Apparently, the kRs is influenced by elevation, topography
    and the aridity index though in the present study weak correlations (not shown)
    were found between the aforementioned factors and the kRs values relative to both
    the PMT and HS methods. The statistics shown in Table 4 indicate that the PMT
    method satisfactorily predicts ETo in most of the stations, which is supported
    by R2 higher than 0.90 and b coefficient between 0.98 and 1.02 in 90 and 85% of
    the stations, respectively. The RMSE is lower than 0.70 and 0.50 mm d−1 in 90%
    and 68% of the cases, EF and dIA were ≥0.90 and ≥0.98 for more than 90% of the
    stations. These results are only slightly better than the corresponding results
    for the HS method in Table 3. Results suggest a good estimation of ETo with PMT,
    particularly for practical irrigation scheduling and for using in drought indices
    computation such as the PDSI (e.g., Paulo et al., 2012). Results indicate that
    the use of PMT method for ETo estimation in the study area is worthwhile when
    only limited data are available. However, coefficients of determination <0.90
    for Zabol, Chabahar, Abadan and Torbat suggest that the estimated PMT in these
    stations substantially deviates from the PM-ETo. The achieved results for PMT
    are consistent with those obtained for HS, which shows the weakest agreements
    with PM-ETo for the same stations as PMT. 3.3. Role of temperature adjustment
    for Tdew estimation The effectiveness of temperature adjustment in improving the
    PMT estimation was statistically evaluated for all considered stations, by comparing
    the regression coefficient b, R2 and RMSE statistics relating PMT and PM-ETo data,
    before and after temperature adjustment (Table 5). Table 5. Statistically assessment

    0.92 0.58 Results suggested that temperature adjustments for humid and sub-humid
    climates, i.e., computing Tdew from Eq. (7) instead of simply using Tmin, considerably
    improves PMT estimation, where b and R2 increased and RMSE decreased after temperature
    adjustment for all stations characterized with humid and sub-humid climates of
    Iran. As an example, the coefficient of determination for Rasht and Ramsar stations
    increased from 0.88 to 0.94 after temperature correction; for Ilam, RMSE decreased
    from 0.65 to 0.44 mm d−1. These results indicate that the good performance of
    PMT estimation analyzed in the previous section is largely due to temperature
    adjustment for humidity. Temperature adjustment for stations situated in semi-arid,
    arid and hyper-arid climates of Iran also showed to have improved ETo estimation.
    Differently from humid climates where temperature adjustment noticeably improved
    the R2 statistic, the influence of temperature adjustment in semi arid to hyper-arid
    climates largely consisted in substantially increasing the regression coefficient,
    with b approaching the 1:1 line. These results indicate that the temperature adjustment
    for aridity, with lowering Tdew relative to raw Tmin, leads to overcome the common
    under estimation of PMT in arid conditions. Meanwhile, despite negligible improvements
    of R2, noticeable improvements in RMSE statistic were observed for most of the
    stations situated in semi-arid, arid and hyper-arid climates. This fact suggests
    that temperature adjustment is of paramount importance for PMT estimation in such
    climates. 3.4. Role of wind speed in PMT estimation As were shown in Fig. 2, Fig.
    4, the estimated ETo by the HS and PMT methods show poor agreement with the PM-ETo
    at some stations situated in the very dry climate of eastern and southern Iran,
    where HS and PMT methods largely underestimate ETo for the warm season. In exploring
    the possible factor responsible for the observed disagreement, we noticed that
    the considered stations are located in the area where extreme wind speed occurs,
    particularly in the summer. The spatial pattern of the mean seasonal wind speed
    over the country is depicted in Fig. 5 to support an analysis about the possible
    role played by the wind factor in ETo estimation. In Fig. 5a and d it is evident
    that the mean autumn and winter wind speed do not exceed 2 m s−1 in most parts
    of the country except for a narrow band in southern and eastern Iran, where wind
    speed is between 3 and 4 m s−1. Fig. 5b shows an increase of wind speed in southern
    and eastern parts of Iran during spring, contrarily to northern half of the country.
    Differently, wind speed in summer increases drastically in eastern Iran (Fig.
    5c), where it may exceed 8 m s−1. These data indicate that the mean seasonal wind
    speed in southern and eastern Iran, particularly for the warm spring and summer
    seasons, is often much higher than the common default value of 2 m s−1 used for
    PMT estimation, thus leading to substantial deviation of PMT estimates relative
    to PM-ETo data, during those seasons. The role of extreme wind speed on PM-ETo
    estimation may be very important, mainly when it is associated with very hot weather
    in summer, which calls for using an estimate of wind speed different than that
    of the default value of 2 m s−1. Since the HS equation does not include any wind
    speed parameter, its results are likely underestimating ETo in windy and hot conditions
    like Zabol and various other stations located in arid and hyper-arid climates
    of southern and eastern Iran (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Spatial patterns of mean seasonal wind speed (m s−1) over Iran for: (a) autumn,
    (b) spring, (c) summer and (d) winter. As depicted in Fig. 5, the highest wind
    speed, particularly in summer, is observed in Zabol, eastern Iran, where the PMT
    and HS estimations have shown the worst agreement with the PM-ETo (Fig. 2, Fig.
    4). This results from the fact that the observed wind speed in this station is
    several times higher than the default value of 2 m s−1, particularly during the
    very hot summer and late spring. The summer wind speed is also considerably higher
    than 2 m s−1 in Abadan, Sabzevar, Birjand, Torbat, Shahroud and Mashad stations
    in southern and eastern Iran, where the ETo estimated by PMT and HS have shown
    a weak agreement with the PM-ETo for extreme ETo values. The summer wind speed
    is also higher than the fixed value of 2 m s−1 in Tabriz, north-western Iran,
    giving rise to a wide dispersion of the highest ETo values in the scatter plots
    of this station (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). In most of these stations, the higher deviation
    of the PMT (and HS) estimations from the PM-ETo correspond to the extreme ETo
    values that occurred in the warm season of the year. Therefore, the observed disagreement
    between the PMT (and HS) estimations and PM-ETo in these stations can be partially
    due to not considering the wind speed influence in HS method and a default value
    of only 2 m s−1 in PMT, which is much smaller than the actual wind speed that
    is used for the PM-ETo computation. To examine the role played by wind speed in
    PM-ETo estimation, Fig. 6 illustrates the relationship between estimated ETo by
    PMT and PM-ETo at some selected stations, considering different scenarios: (1)
    using the default wind speed value of 2 m s−1 in PMT computations, (2) considering
    only the PM-ETo data corresponding to wind speed not exceeding 2 m s−1, (3) using
    observed local wind speed in PMT replacing the default wind speed value, and (4)
    using average seasonal wind speed to replace the default value of 2 m s−1 in PMT
    computation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Relationships between
    estimated ETo by PMT method and PM-ETo at some selected stations when: the wind
    speed is fixed at 2 m s−1 for PMT computation (a–f); data with local wind speed
    > 2 m s−1 was not considered (g-i); local actual wind speed was taken for PMT
    computations (m–r), and regional averages of seasonal wind speed were used for
    PMT computations (s–x). As shown in Fig. 6a–f, the PMT method extremely underestimates
    ETo values corresponding to the summers in Shahroud, Mashad, Torbat, Abadan, Birjand
    and Zabol stations, thus leading to very low coefficients of determination, even
    though the optimum b slope could be achieved for some. By excluding the observations
    with wind speed >2 m s−1 from the analysis (scenario 2), the association between
    the PMT and PM-ETo noticeably improved, with increased coefficients of determination
    and reduced residuals of the variance represented by a narrower dispersion band
    of the scatter plots shown in Fig. 6g–l. To further justify the role of wind speed
    in the association between the PMT and PM-ETo, Fig. 6m–r illustrates that the
    association between the two models substantially improved when local wind speed
    was used for PMT computation rather than the default value (scenario 3). Differently
    from discussions in the literature suggesting that wind speed has very low impact
    on ETo estimation, the results obtained with scenario 3 illustrated that it is
    an important factor in arid and semi-arid climates when the stations are exposed
    to extreme wind speed, particularly in hot seasons. As an example, Fig. 6f shows
    the scatter plot for the extremely windy station of Zabol, in eastern Iran, which
    is well known for its extreme summer wind speed that usually dominates the region
    for the whole summer time (Fig. 5c). As is depicted in Fig. 6f both R2 and b are
    very low for scenario 1, thus indicating a very poor estimation of ETo by PMT.
    Substantial improvement was observed for scenario 2, when the data with extreme
    wind speed (wind speed >4 m−1) were excluded, which led to a considerable improvement
    of R2 and b (Fig. 6l). It is worth nothing that the selected threshold for Zabol
    was set to wind speed >4 m−1 since very few cases have wind speed <2 m−1. Fig.
    6r also demonstrates a much improved goodness of fit when local wind speed was
    used for PMT computation rather than the default value of 2 m s−1 (scenario 3),
    though the regression still remains nonlinear, which can be related to the quality
    of the wind data; however it could not be appropriately analyzed as the wind is
    a local dependent variable, so having extreme spatial variability in this region.
    In order to find a practical solution for improving the PMT estimates, it was
    supposed that using an appropriate regional wind speed instead of using a default
    value could improve the PMT estimation in windy areas (scenario 4); related results
    using an averaged seasonal wind speed are shown in Fig. 6s–x. In this scenario,
    two fixed wind speed values were used, respectively for cold and hot seasons.
    As shown in Fig. 6s–x, this approach was able to improve R2 but did not provide
    improved regression coefficients since b values indicate a quite large overestimation
    of ETo. Since all the observation datasets have different wind speeds, using the
    seasonal mean value improved some parts of the scatter plot but adversely impacted
    some other parts. Therefore, it can be concluded that since the wind speed is
    highly variable in time, it is likely that its time variation may have more influence
    than its magnitude in estimating PMT. In most of the stations the wind speed often
    is around 2 m s−1 throughout the year, whereas extreme winds may dominate a station
    only for specific periods of the year as is illustrated in Fig. 5; hence adopting
    any fixed value may lead to under- or over-estimation by the PMT method. As illustrated
    in Fig. 6s–x, using seasonal wind speed instead of the default value of 2 m s−1
    is less successful in improving PMT results in windy stations and is therefore
    not advisable. 3.5. Comparing PMT and HS methods As discussed earlier, the performances
    of both PMT and HS methods are generally adequate for estimating ETo for all climatic
    regions of Iran using limited available datasets. Table 6 presents the result
    of the Diebold and Mariano (1995) B statistic test that was used for cross-comparison
    of the adequacy of the estimations by the two methods relative to the PM-ETo.
    The test value is out of the interval [−1.96, 1.96] when there is a significant
    difference at 95% level. Results in Table 6 show that HS equation performed significantly
    better than PMT for 14 stations while PMT performed significantly better for 9
    stations. It is worth noting that the statistic B is positive (negative) and significant
    when HS (PMT) performed better. Better results for HS largely overcome those of
    PMT for the semi-arid region while PMT has shown to be superior for the humid
    and sub-humid areas. However, differences were not significant for 43% of stations
    considered in this study. Despite these statistic, the users should analyze the
    size of errors, particularly RMSE, the adequacy of linear regression, mainly relative
    to the value of the regression coefficient b, as well as the efficiency indicators
    EF and dIA. Table 6. The Diebold and Mariano (1995) B test for equal accuracy

    ETo The spatial pattern of annual ETo over Iran estimated with the PM-ETo method
    using full datasets (Fig. 7a) shows a gradual increase of ETo from north to South,
    with the lowest values over the northern humid and sub-humid climates of Iran
    and larger ETo estimates for arid and hyper-arid climates in the southern and
    eastern country. The range of annual ETo varies from 700 mm in the humid coastal
    areas of south-western Caspian Sea up to 2800 mm in hyper-arid desertic areas
    of eastern Iran. Most parts of the coastal areas of the Caspian Sea and the mountainous
    areas of northern and north-western Iran depict ETo values between 700 and 1200
    mm, increasing southward and eastward due to the decrease in latitude and/or altitude.
    The mountainous areas of mid-western and north-eastern Iran, as well as the mid-central
    region of the country, exhibit ETo between 1200 and 1600 mm, while the ETo values
    for a vast area in central, southern and eastern Iran range from 1600 to 2000
    mm. The highest ETo with 2000–2800 mm is observed in south-western and eastern
    Iran. The high ETo in south-western Iran is related to temperature, the highest
    observed in the country. Differently, in eastern Iran, it relates to the very
    high wind speed and dryness, with occurrence of very low annual mean relative
    humidity (<40%) that even reduced to <25% in summer when the region is exposed
    to extreme wind speed. The spatial pattern of PM-ETo over Iran represented herein
    is comparable to that of for Dinpashoh (2006), though the number of used stations
    and the considered data periods are different. The obtained result is also consistent
    with the results achieved by Tabari et al., 2011a, Tabari et al., 2011b and Tabari
    and Aghajanloo (2012) for eastern, western and northern Iran, respectively, considering
    both the magnitude and spatial variability of ETo. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Spatial pattern of annual ETo over Iran estimated by (a) PM-ETo,
    (b) HS, and (c) PMT methods. Fig. 7b and c shows the spatial patterns of ETo over
    Iran computed with the HS and PMT methods, respectively. These spatial patterns
    are identical and also resemble to that of PM-ETo shown in Fig. 7a. However, Fig.
    7b shows lower estimates of ETo for eastern Iran relative to Fig. 7a and c since
    it was not possible to use local wind speed for HS estimation contrarily to the
    case for PM and PMT methods. The observed concordance of HS and PMT maps (Fig.
    7b and c) with the map of PM-ETo (Fig. 7a), considering both the spatial pattern
    and the magnitude of the estimations, in addition to results in Table 3, Table
    4, indicates that the HS and PMT methods are appropriate alternatives for estimation
    of ETo in all climatic regions of Iran, particularly for the very remote areas,
    when only minimum and maximum temperature are available. Using PMT may be preferable
    when the dataset is partly comprising full data or partially full data because
    then it is possible to use the PMT for the periods when radiation or humidity
    data are required. Then the same FAO-PM equation is used with either observation
    or estimated data. Differently, the HS method is preferable if it is not desirable
    to correct Tmin data to compensate for station aridity. 4. Discussion and conclusions
    Monthly averages of maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, sunshine
    duration and wind speed, corresponding to the period 1971–2005 at 40 Iranian synoptic
    stations distributed over the country were utilized for estimation of ETo using
    the PM-ETo, the temperature PMT and HS methods. Aiming at a comparative analysis
    of the behaviour of these methods, the climatic zones of Iran were identified
    utilizing the UNEP aridity index, which is based on the ratio of mean annual precipitation
    to mean annual potential evapotranspiration. To estimate ETo using both the HS
    and PMT methods, appropriate values for kRs, an empirical radiation adjustment
    coefficient, were searched for each station. For estimation of Tdew from Tmin
    to be used with the PMT, the latter was corrected for aridity. For humid climates
    an empirical approach to estimate Tdew from the mean temperature was used and
    applied for PMT estimation. The performance of the HS and PMT methods against
    PM-ETo were evaluated through a set of commonly used statistics. Results show
    that searching appropriate kRs for estimation of solar radiation for both HS and
    PMT methods results in significant accuracy improvement in the estimation of ETo.
    It was observed that kRs values for the stations located in the sub-humid and
    humid climates of western and northern Iran are smaller than those for the semi-arid
    to hyper-arid climates of central, southern and eastern Iran, suggesting a north-south
    and west-east increasing spatial trend. It was also found that the kRs values
    selected for both methods in a given station are either identical or show negligible
    difference. Despite results herein concern a wide range of climates, it is desirable
    to have these results confirmed through studies relative to other areas and using
    different time step computations. The adjustment of Tmin for estimating Tdew to
    be used with the PMT method has shown to highly improve the performance of the
    method for semi-arid to hyper-arid climates. Moreover, the adoption of an empirical
    approach to estimate Tdew from the minimum temperature also significantly increased
    the accuracy of PMT estimation for humid climates. Overall, estimates by HS and
    PMT strongly correlate with estimates by PM-ETo, implying that the considered
    methods appropriately predict ETo for all climatic regions of Iran if the appropriate
    kRs was considered. Results described also indicate that when datasets are incomplete,
    particularly relative to radiation and air humidity data, ETo calculations may
    be performed for the periods when data are lacking with the FAO-PM equation using
    radiation and/or VPD parameters estimated from Tmax and Tmin as for the PMT method.
    The statistical test on differences between HS and PMT methods has shown that
    HS is more often significantly superior to PMT in the semi-arid region while the
    PMT performed significantly better than HS in humid and sub-humid areas. However,
    no significant differences were found for 43% of cases. A weak/poor agreement
    was however found for some stations situated in the very dry climate of eastern
    and southern Iran owing to the role played there by extreme and variable wind
    speed. The observed discrepancies between HS (and PMT) and PM-ETo in the stations
    situated in eastern Iran is attributed to the extreme wind speed, particularly
    during summer when ETo is higher. The observed disagreement between the estimations
    by PMT (and HS) and PM-ETo may be partially due to not considering wind speed
    in HS method and to the less effective default wind speed value usually considered
    for PMT estimation, which is much lower than the actual value used there for PM-ETo
    computation. However, using seasonal regional values as default wind speed values
    decreased the variance of residuals and the heteroscedasticity of regressions
    but increased the regression coefficients and therefore ETo became over-estimated
    in these hot and windy locations. It is likely that the time variability of wind
    speed plays a major role in the discrepancies between PMT and PM-ETo estimates
    and therefore it is hardly possible to find a default value or empirical function
    that takes that variability into account in PMT when wind speed data are not available.
    Given these circumstances, it is likely not appropriate to try finding a modification
    of HS for considering wind speed. However, considering the need to minimize errors
    in estimating ETo when only temperature data are available in areas where wind
    may play a major role, this problem remains open to further research developments.
    The spatial distribution of annual ETo showed a gradual increasing from north
    to south, with the lowest ETo values observed over northern humid and sub-humid
    climates of Iran and larger ETo estimates for arid and hyper-arid climates in
    the southern and eastern country. The spatial patterns of ETo computed using limited
    weather data with HS and PMT methods are identical and resemble to that of PM-ETo,
    thus confirming the above referred conclusions indicating that the HS and PMT
    methods are appropriate alternatives for estimation of ETo in all climatic regions
    of Iran, particularly for the very remote stations having only minimum and maximum
    temperature records. References Ahmadi and Fooladmand, 2008 S.A. Ahmadi, H.R.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Accurate estimates of daily ref. ET are needed
    for efficient irrigation management. • Climate data from non-ET stations can be
    used to fill ET for sparse ET-based network. • GP models performed better than
    OLS regression models for daily ref. ET estimates. Summary Accurate estimates
    of daily crop evapotranspiration (ET) are needed for efficient irrigation management,
    especially in arid and semi-arid regions where crop water demand exceeds rainfall.
    Daily grass or alfalfa reference ET values and crop coefficients are widely used
    to estimate crop water demand. Inaccurate reference ET estimates can hence have
    a tremendous impact on irrigation costs and the demands on U.S. freshwater resources,
    particularly within the Ogallala aquifer region. ET networks calculate reference
    ET using local meteorological data. With gaps in spatial coverage of existing
    networks and the agriculture-based Texas High Plains ET (TXHPET) network in jeopardy
    due to lack of funding, there is an immediate need for alternative sources capable
    of filling data gaps without high maintenance and field-based support costs. Non-agricultural
    weather stations located throughout the Texas High Plains are providing publicly
    accessible meteorological data. However, there are concerns that the data may
    not be suitable for estimating reference ET due to factors such as weather station
    siting, fetch requirements, data formats, parameters recorded, and quality control
    issues. The goal of the research reported in this paper is to assess the use of
    alternative data sources for reference ET computation. Towards this objective,
    we trained Gaussian process models, an instance of kernel-based machine learning
    algorithms, on data collected from weather stations to estimate reference ET values
    and augment the TXHPET database. Results show that Gaussian process models provide
    much greater accuracy than baseline least square regression models. Previous article

    High Plains ET network 1. Introduction Accurate estimates of daily crop evapotranspiration
    (ET) are valuable for irrigation management within arid, semi-arid, and semi-humid
    regions where crop water demand exceeds rainfall. Daily grass/alfalfa reference
    ET (ETo) values are widely used in conjunction with crop coefficients (Kc) to
    estimate crop water demand. Hence, the impact of inaccurate ET estimates can hardly
    be overstated given the increased demands on U.S. freshwater resources, especially
    within the central Great Plains underlain by the vast but declining Ogallala groundwater
    aquifer. Reference ET can be estimated using the FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998) or
    the recent ASCE Standardized Reference ET Equation (Allen et al., 2005). Areal
    coverage of ET networks is not universal and there are significant gaps in the
    spatial coverage. It is further complicated by high spatial variation in air temperature,
    wind speed, wind direction and other weather parameters due to regional effects
    such as atmospheric circulation patterns (Buishand and Brandsma, 1997, Knapp,
    1992) and local effects such as topography (Goovaerts, 2000), land use (Li et
    al., 2010), elevation (Dodson and Marks, 1997) and soil properties (López-Granados
    et al., 2005). It is therefore difficult to use one predetermined weather station
    for determining daily reference ET for irrigation management over large regions.
    A sufficiently dense network of weather stations can effectively capture the spatial
    variability of parameters for use in computing reference ET. However, funding
    and staffing issues are ongoing concerns of many ET networks, making it difficult
    to expand coverage through additional weather stations. Although remote sensing
    based ET estimates are showing promise of expanding areal coverage and integration
    capabilities, accuracy of these methods is dependent on accuracy of input (i.e.,
    weather data and/or reference ET). There is hence an immediate need for exploring
    alternative data sources capable of filling data gaps without high maintenance
    and field-based support costs. Fortunately, there are other (non-agricultural,
    non-ET) weather stations and data networks, and some of these networks make data
    publicly accessible. However, there are concerns that the data may not be appropriate
    for estimating reference ET due to factors such as weather station siting, data
    formats, parameters recorded, and data quality control issues. Fig. 1 from an
    article by Porter et al. (2012) illustrates the sensitivity of average daily grass
    reference ET to changes in air temperature, dew temperature, wind speed and solar
    radiation by 1 °C, 1 °C, 1 m s−1 and 25 W m−2 respectively, using the representative
    Bushland ET station in the Texas High Plains. The authors reported that grass
    reference ET calculations were most sensitive to errors in wind speed and air
    temperature, and that sensitivity was greater during the mid-summer growing season
    when greater accuracy levels are required for irrigation scheduling. For example,
    a 1 °C error in air temperature throughout the growing season in the Texas High
    Plains would yield ≈25 mm error in the total grass reference ET for the typical
    corn growing season. The cumulative effect of this error over the irrigated corn
    acreage within the Texas High Plains is approximately equivalent to the total
    drinking water consumption by the City of Houston for about 22 days (Marek et
    al., 2010). Erroneous selection of reference weather station and/or wrong values
    of reference ET rates can thus affect the water use efficiency and producers’
    net profits, in addition to the loss of mined water of the Ogallala aquifer. This
    illustrative example demonstrates the need for accurate reference ET data for
    irrigation scheduling and irrigation management. Download : Download full-size

    temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation by 1 °C, 1
    °C, 1 m/s, and 25 W/m2 respectively, using data from Bushland ET station in the
    Texas High Plains (Porter et al., 2012). Most statistical models reported in the
    literature on irrigation management are based on ordinary least square regression.
    Popular models used in regression include: (1) linear; ; (2) exponential; ; (3)
    power or logarithmic; ; and (4) a quadratic polynomial; . In these models, represents
    the desired output vector (e.g., reference ET values from ET stations) and is
    a vector representing input values such as rainfall, irrigation amount, weather
    parameters or reference ET estimated at non-agricultural weather stations. Values
    of coefficients (vectors with the same dimension as ) and c are tuned on training
    data such that the computed values of output are as close as possible to the given
    (i.e., known ground truth) output values. The ordinary least squares regression
    formulations tend to fix the basis functions before observing the training data,
    and the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the dimensions of input
    space. Furthermore, the basis functions are not adaptable to data and the associated
    curse of dimensionality makes a strong case for the use of more sophisticated
    models (Bishop, 2008). In recent years, numerous statistical learning algorithms
    are being developed and used for inference and prediction. Examples of such methods
    include artificial neural network (ANN) (ASCE Task Committee on Applications of
    Artificial Neural Networks in Hydrology, 2000a, ASCE Task Committee on Applications
    of Artificial Neural Networks in Hydrology, 2000b, Buscema and Sacco, 2000, DeRoach,
    1989, Hornik et al., 1989), support vector machine (Vapnik, 1995) and Gaussian
    Process (GP) models (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996). These methods provide substantial
    benefits over linear (or other) regression models. For instance, ANNs readily
    adapt to data and can be used to model complex functions between input and output
    parameters. Although different algorithms can be used to learn ANNs based on a
    compromise between computational cost and performance, the most popular choice
    is the back propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986). However, ANN formulations
    can result in local minima, lead to over-fitting, and become computationally expensive
    in high-dimensional spaces. Further, it is also not easy to extract an understandable
    interpretation of the functions learned. Support vector machines (SVMs) have a
    simple geometric interpretation, avoid overfitting and find global solutions.
    They project input features to high dimensions, resulting in sparse representations
    and robust decision boundaries. However, SVMs (and other similar algorithms) require
    that the parametric function that models the relationship between inputs and outputs
    be defined in advance—choosing an appropriate function from the infinite space
    of functions may be difficult in complex problem domains. Gaussian process is
    a non-parametric kernel-based machine learning algorithm. GP models are well-suited
    for the estimation step of our study and they capture the temporal evolution of
    normally-distributed random variables that represent the patterns being tracked.
    They have been successfully used for large-scale estimation problems with high-dimensional
    features, e.g., nuclear disasters, climate modeling and sensor placement for surveillance
    (Higdon et al., 2003, Kennedy and O’Hagan, 2001, Krause et al., 2008). To the
    best of our knowledge, only a few applications of GP models have been found in
    the research field of water resources management, including ground water transport
    (Marrel et al., 2009) and hydrological modeling (Song et al., 2011). The objective
    of the study reported in this paper is to identify, evaluate and use alternative
    meteorological data sources for accurately computing reference ET values, resulting
    in efficient irrigation management and water resources planning. We trained GP
    models to estimate reference ET values using data from non-ET National Weather
    Service (NWS) stations. Although our study focused on the Texas High Plains, the
    experimental methodology can be used for estimating reference ET from non-agricultural
    and non-ET weather stations elsewhere in the U.S. and the world. An initial version
    of this study was reported in (Holman et al., 2013). The remainder of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the geographic locations included
    in our study, while Section 3 presents an overview of the various steps involved
    in the study. Next, Gaussian processes and the underlying mathematical concepts
    are described in Section 4. The experimental setup and results are discussed in
    Sections 5 Experimental setup, 6 Experimental results respectively, followed by
    the conclusions in Section 7. 2. Study area This study covers a 39-county area
    of the Texas High Plains, as shown in Fig. 2. Most of this region is semi-arid
    with highly variable precipitation (both temporally and spatially), averaging
    400–560 mm from west to east. Most rainfall occurs in scattered thunderstorms—some
    areas may receive 50–100 mm of daily precipitation while areas a short distance
    away may not receive any rainfall. In 2010, the Lubbock weather station recorded
    a total of 672 mm of annual rainfall, while in 2011 the station only recorded
    149 mm. This region is also known to have high evaporative demand (approximately
    2500 mm/year Class A pan evaporation) due to high solar radiation, high vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD), and strong regional advection. The grass reference ET
    data from 15 weather stations managed by the TXHPET network (Porter et al., 2005)
    (Fig. 1) were used to train and evaluate GP models that estimate reference ET
    values based on meteorological data from non-ET NWS stations. Download : Download

    High Plains ET network and paired NWS stations in the Texas High Plains. 3. Materials
    and methods This study was implemented in four steps: (1) identify publicly accessible
    data sources and evaluate whether they provide sufficient data parameters, detail
    and quality for use in computing daily reference ET; (2) determine whether missing
    data can be estimated using other available data, trends and associative models
    and calculate the daily reference ET; (3) assess and validate the quality of reference
    ET values determined from these data sources compared with valid ET network data
    sources; and (4) develop and evaluate models based on statistical learning methods
    to calculate reference ET given data from non-agricultural, non-ET weather stations
    or networks. In the remainder of the paper, we refer to non-agricultural, non-ET
    weather stations as “non-ET stations”. The first step involved a thorough assessment
    of all the weather networks in the Texas High Plains for estimating daily reference
    ET. Selection criteria include: (a) timely and real-time availability of data
    to the public at no cost; (b) length and continuity of historic records; (c) availability
    of measurements of parameters needed for estimating reference ET; and (d) ability
    to accurately estimate parameters that are missing or not measured. Once suitable
    non-ET stations were identified, a map showing the location of these stations
    was used to create a Thiessen polygon map, which (in turn) was used to pair these
    stations with selected agricultural weather stations of the TXHPET network (i.e.,
    the “ET stations”) for model development and evaluation. The weather parameters
    considered include: daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, average dew point
    temperature, average wind speed, average relative humidity, barometric measure
    and solar radiation. The second step involved computing missing data using equations
    provided in the 2005 Standardized reference ET methodology (Allen et al., 2005).
    For instance, if the solar radiation values were not measured or missing for a
    non-ET station, they were estimated using the complex method equation provided
    below: (1) where and are daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, is extraterrestrial
    radiation, is an empirical coefficient for semi-arid climates, and is solar radiation.
    Barometric pressure is calculated using the elevation of the corresponding weather
    station. If the missing data cannot be estimated (e.g. wind speed) for a given
    day, then the data records for that day were removed. After verifying the weather
    dataset and filling the missing data, unit conversions of the weather parameters
    were performed (as necessary) to estimate daily reference ET using the ASCE Standardized
    ET equation-based Bushland Reference ET Calculator (Gowda et al., 2012). In the
    third step, statistical relationships were computed between daily reference ET
    estimates obtained from the ET stations and the corresponding non-ET stations
    to assess feasibility of using alternative data sources to expand (or increase
    data intensity within) the coverage area of the Texas High Plains ET network.
    Coefficient of determination ( ), slope and intercept of the regression line,
    Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to
    compare the reference ET values obtained from the ET stations and those obtained
    from the corresponding non-ET stations. The value of describes the proportion
    of variability in the observed data that is explained by the model— ranges from
    0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better goodness of fit (model explanation).
    For instance, with an intercept of 0 and slope of 1 indicates a perfect fit between
    the observed and modeled data. The NSE is a common efficiency measure that compares
    variance in estimations with the measured data variance. NSE ranges between— and
    1—values closer to 1 are more accurate and an NSE of 1 represents an optimal model.
    Negative NSE values indicate that the mean of the observations is more accurate
    than the model estimation. An RMSE of 0 also indicates a perfect fit—it is usually
    computed as a of the observed mean, e.g., RMSE < 50% is usually considered low.
    The RMSE measure is appropriate for our study because it provides values in the
    same units as the values that are to be estimated (i.e., reference ET). More information
    on performance statistics can be found in Moriasi et al. (2007). In the fourth
    step, the Gaussian process models were trained and evaluated. These models capture
    the relationship between the meteorological data from non-ET stations and the
    corresponding reference ET values from the ET stations. The trained models can
    then be used to estimate reference ET values given new data from the non-ET stations.
    For evaluating the estimation ability of GP models, the daily reference ET database
    was divided into two parts. Data corresponding to odd-numbered days of the year
    were used for model development and data from even-numbered days of the year were
    used for validation. Performance statistics ( , NSE and RMSE) were used to evaluate
    and compare the estimation capabilities of the GP models with (baseline) linear
    regression (LR) models. 4. Gaussian processes Gaussian processes are sophisticated
    supervised learning models used for regression (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996)
    and classification (Williams and Barber, 1998). Supervised learning approaches
    infer a hypothesis function based on training data. Training data consists of
    a set of N vectors consisting of inputs: and corresponding target outputs: , to
    generate input–output pairs: . The supervised learner uses the training data to
    learn a model that approximates h. To evaluate the learned model’s estimation
    ability, a testing dataset consisting of previously unseen inputs and target outputs
    is defined: . The learned model processes input vectors of the testing dataset
    to estimate outputs: , which are compared with ground truth (i.e., actual) target
    outputs. Various statistical error measures can hence be used to compute the accuracy
    of values estimated by the learned model. For non-linear regression problems,
    the unknown function exists in the infinite-dimensional space of possible functions
    for , making it difficult to decide the range of possible non-linear functions.
    Standard parametric models such as ANNs, linear regression and polynomial regression
    require that have an explicitly defined functional form whose parameters are defined
    in advance—the values of parameters are assigned by learning weights . Choosing
    this function from the infinite space of function types and weights can be a challenge.
    Gaussian processes address this issue by placing a prior over the space of functions.
    GP models thus do not need an explicit parametric definition of the function ,
    i.e., they are non-parametric. Instead, (stochastic) random variables define priors
    for each input vector. Random functions defined over the space of inputs constitute
    the GP prior, as shown in Fig. 3. During the training phase, the discrete set
    of inputs are used to modify these functions to pass as close as possible to the
    target outputs, thus approximating the (unknown) underlying function. Gaussian
    processes can be viewed as a natural generalization of a Gaussian distribution
    over a finite vector space to an infinite space of functions. Just as a Gaussian
    distribution is defined by its mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is defined
    by its mean and covariance functions and : (2) where the function f is distributed
    as a Gaussian process with mean function and covariance function . In our research,
    we define the mean function as the zero function. The covariance function expresses
    the expected covariance of the values at each pair of points and . Given N input
    vectors in the training data, the covariance function is a covariance matrix .
    This matrix can be used to estimate output values for new inputs. In general,
    the estimated distribution is Gaussian with mean and covariance: (3) where is
    a new input vector, are the training data input vectors, denotes the matrix of
    covariances between the input and training data, K is the covariance matrix for
    training data, and . This algorithm has time complexity due to the matrix inversion
    in Eq. (3). GP formulations can hence become infeasible for data with a large
    number of samples. Algorithms are being developed to enable GP formulations of
    domains with large datasets (Bishop, 2008). However, our experiments consist of
    a few thousand training samples per weather station and the time complexity is
    (currently) not an issue. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Illustrative
    (general) example of a Gaussian process prior—three random functions that define
    outputs as a function of the inputs. GP models use the input values in the training
    data to incrementally revise these functions with the objective of minimizing
    the error in estimating the corresponding output values. Many different options
    exist for selecting covariance functions for a Gaussian process. The main requirement
    is that the function should generate a non-negative definite covariance matrix
    for any set of inputs . Graphically, the goal is to define covariances such that
    points that are nearby in the input space produce similar output estimates. In
    the research reported in this paper, we chose the popular radial basis function
    (RBF) kernels (Musavi et al., 1992): (4) The key advantage of using a non-parametric
    model such as GP is that it does not require any manual parameter tuning. Instead,
    the covariance function contains hyperparameters that are tuned automatically
    to maximize the likelihood of training data. Eq. (4) contains a single hyperparameter
    . Assigning different values to the hyperparameter results in different GP models.
    We randomly initialize a finite set of hyperparameters over the space of possible
    hyperparameter values and compute the estimation error of the corresponding GP
    models on the training data. This training error is computed by building a GP
    model using the training data, and comparing the output values estimated by the
    GP model for the training data inputs with the actual outputs included in the
    training data. The hyperparameter value that results in the lowest error, or equivalently
    the highest accuracy, is chosen for subsequent experimental studies. Section 5
    illustrates this approach to compute a suitable value for the hyperparameter.
    5. Experimental setup The experiments performed for this project were implemented
    using the WEKA open source machine-learning library (Hall et al., 2009). WEKA
    includes Java implementations of popular machine-learning algorithms such as GP,
    SVM, linear regression and multi-layer perceptron (ANN). The library also has
    evaluation schemes that can be used to compare performance of different algorithms
    over different datasets. We adapted the existing implementation of GP to fit our
    needs. Our application first reads in the training data and trains different GP
    models corresponding to different values of the hyperparameter ( ). As described
    in Section 4, is selected based on the GP model that results in the lowest RMSE
    between the estimated reference ET and actual TXHPET reference ET over the training
    data. This GP model is chosen for further use as it is the most accurate model.
    The RMSE statistic was used because it represents the actual difference in ET
    in mm. Fig. 4 illustrates this approach to compute the value of for the data obtained
    from the paired non-ET station and TXHPET station in Lubbock. A linear regression
    (LR) model was also learned from the same training data to serve as a baseline
    for comparison. The estimation accuracy of learned GP models was then compared
    with the estimation accuracy of LR models on separate test data for each non-ET
    station. For instance, Fig. 4 also shows that the GP models result in significantly
    lower RMSE in comparison with the LR models. It is also possible to automatically
    select the best value of by computing error measures over a separate validation
    set (Bishop, 2008). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. RMSE of GP models
    trained using data from the paired non-ET station and TXHPET station in Lubbock
    for different values of the hyperparameter ( ). GP model with lowest RMSE can
    be selected automatically from training data and used to estimate outputs for
    the test data. All GP models perform much better than LR models. To ensure accurate
    estimates from the learned models, the test data must be drawn from the same space
    as the training data, i.e., the probability distributions underlying the datasets
    must be equivalent. Consider the Lubbock datasets over the years 2001–2010, and
    consider the data division scheme that uses data from 2001 to 2005 as the training
    set and data correspond to years 2006–2010 as the test set. Such a data division
    scheme will not work because the wet and dry years are typically inconsistent—the
    models trained with data corresponding to dry years will result in high errors
    on data corresponding to wet years. We therefore split the data evenly across
    all years by using odd days for training and even days for testing. Although such
    a division of data into training set and testing set makes it difficult to run
    a standard cross-validation analysis, we repeated the experiments after swapping
    the training and test datasets. Overall, we conducted experimental trials using
    data from 15 non-ET (i.e., NWS) weather stations matched with the TXHPET stations
    determined by the Thiessen polygon (Fig. 2). We used data consisting of daily
    measurements over a period of 10 years. Experimental trials were divided into
    two groups based on the inputs used to train GP models. In the first set of experiments,
    reference ET values were computed from non-ET station weather parameters (see
    Section 3) and used as inputs to GP models—each input is thus a single value.
    The corresponding GP models capture the relationship between these reference ET
    values from non-ET stations and the corresponding reference ET values from the
    paired TXHPET station. In the second set of experiments, weather parameters from
    non-ET stations were used as inputs to the GP models—each input is thus a vector
    of weather parameter values. The target outputs were the TXHPET reference ET values.
    We hypothesized that GP models trained in the second set of experiments would
    provide more accurate estimates because they can model and account for the uncertainty
    in computing reference ET from the unreliable observations of weather parameters
    at non-ET stations. For each station, the GP model was trained using training
    data (half the values from the total number of years for each station) and various
    values for the hyperparameter . Once a suitable GP model is selected for further
    use (as described above), error statistics are computed using the reference ET
    estimates provided by this trained model over the test set and the actual reference
    ET values from the paired TXHPET station(s). Measures used for comparison include
    , NSE, and RMSE. 6. Experimental results Fig. 5 summarizes the estimation capabilities
    of the linear regression and Gaussian process models using the measure. Models
    that provide highly accurate estimates will result in points that lie on (or very
    close to) the line. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows results (for Lubbock non-ET and TXHPET
    stations) with LR models and GP models (respectively) that used the reference
    ET computed from non-ET station as inputs. Similarly, Fig. 5(c) and (d) shows
    results with LR models and GP models (respectively) that used the weather parameters
    recorded at the non-ET station as inputs. We observed that the estimates were
    more accurate when the weather parameters were used as inputs instead of the reference
    ET computed at the non-ET stations. This observation was true for both LR and
    GP models, and similar plots were obtained for other stations included in the
    experimental trials. As hypothesized in Section 5, using the weather parameters
    as inputs enables the learned models to account for the uncertainty in observations
    of weather parameters at the non-ET stations. In other words, the models were
    able to capture the correlations in the data more accurately. The results reported
    below therefore correspond to experiments in which the weather parameter measurements
    at non-ET stations were used as inputs to train and test the models. Download

    and LR models for the two sets of experiments using Lubbock-NWS and Lubbock TXHPET
    data. Another key observation based on the results in Fig. 5 is that the GP models
    in Fig. 5(b) and (d) result in much greater accuracy than the corresponding LR
    models. Furthermore, the best performance (i.e., most accurate estimates) were
    obtained using GP models trained using the weather parameters as inputs, as shown
    in Fig. 5(d) where most points are along the diagonal line. Similar results were
    obtained using the data from other stations included in the study. Fig. 6 summarizes
    the results obtained on test data from 15 non-ET (NWS) weather stations, using
    RMSE as the performance measure. We observe that GP models provide much lower
    RMSE in comparison with the LR models. In other words, the reference ET values
    estimated by GP models are much closer to the reference ET values obtained from
    the corresponding TXHPET stations. This performance improvement is statistically
    significant and GP models show significant promise in enabling the use of alternative
    data sources for accurately computing reference ET values. Download : Download

    models, with the results averaged over data from each of the non-ET stations used
    in the study. The GP models result in much lower RMSE compared with LR models.
    Although the improvement in the accuracy of GP models (compared with the LR models)
    is different at different stations, the improvement is significant in all stations
    considered in our study. Stations such as Lubbock and Dalhart produced highly
    accurate estimates: and respectively and and , whereas matching the non-ET (NWS)
    station at Lubbock with the Farwell (TXHPET) station obtained and RMSE of  mm
    for daily reference ET values. This represents error which is still significantly
    better than the LR models that result in an RMSE of with a relative error of .
    Future research could consider additional features for input (e.g., elevation)
    and other GIS selection methods for matching non-ET stations with TXHPET stations.
    For instance, although our analysis identifies a good correlation between the
    Farwell TXHPET station and the Lubbock non-ET station based on the Thiessen polygon
    map, including additional features may help identify stations that are strongly
    correlated. The GP models provide more accurate estimates of reference ET than
    LR models, and this improvement in accuracy has significant practical value. The
    average difference in RMSE for daily reference ET estimates provided by GP and
    LR models is ⩾0.2 mm. For a typical cropping season of about 200 days, this amounts
    to approximately 40 mm or  in. over the season. Although this difference may seem
    rather small, one acre-inch of water for all the fields of the Texas High Plains
    results in approximately 24.8 billion gallons of wasted water (Marek et al., 2010),
    which can be compared to the amount of water supplied to the entire city of Houston
    for about two and a half months! Table 1 summarizes the performance of the LR
    models and GP models at each non-ET station included in our study, using the performance
    measures ( , NSE and RMSE) described in Section 3. With the GP models, each station’s
    and NSE values are closer to 1 with a lower RMSE. The results show that GP models
    provide higher accuracy in estimating reference ET than LR models. Table 1. Performance

    Efficient water resource management represents a pressing need in agriculture.
    Accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ET) are essential for irrigation
    management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where crop water demands
    exceed rainfall. Existing ET stations do not provide the required areal coverage
    and also face funding challenges. This paper presented the results of a study
    conducted towards our long-term goal of using data from non-ET stations for filling
    data gaps in the ET networks. In the context of data collected in the Texas High
    Plains, we described the use of Gaussian process models, an instance of sophisticated
    kernel-based machine learning, to estimate the daily reference ET values based
    on the corresponding data obtained from National Weather Service stations. Our
    experiments show that GP models result in significantly more accurate estimates
    of daily reference ET values than the (popular) linear regression models. We also
    observe that using the daily weather parameter measurements from the non-ET stations
    as inputs (instead of the reference ET computed from the these measurements) results
    in more accurate estimates. The improvement (provided by the GP models) in accurately
    estimating the daily reference ET values addresses a critical need and has significant
    practical value. Errors in reference ET estimates can translate to huge costs
    associated with wasteful use of precious water resources (due to over-watering),
    in addition to crop stress and even crop loss (due to under watering). Although
    our study focused on the Texas High Plains, the models and experimental methodology
    can be adapted to regions elsewhere in the world. Furthermore, Gaussian process
    models and other similar stochastic machine learning algorithms are generic tools
    for classification and regression in high-dimensional input spaces, with significant
    potential for addressing key open challenges in water resources management and
    other sub-fields of agriculture. USDA EEO disclaimer The U.S. Department of Agriculture

    \ parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture\n(SM)\
    \ inﬂuences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land\
    \ surface and\natmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations\
    \ of SM is critical for numerous\nlarge-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave\
    \ remote sensing provides many algorithms to\nobtain SM at large scale, such as\
    \ SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are\nalmost low resolution\
    \ and not applicable in small catchment or ﬁeld scale. Estimations of SM from\n\
    optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and signiﬁcant\
    \ progress\nhas been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents\
    \ a new, comprehensive and\nsystematic review of using optical and thermal remote\
    \ sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis\nand status of the estimation\
    \ methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important\nand latest\
    \ advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown\
    \ in this\npaper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly\
    \ depends on the relationship\nbetween SM and the surface reﬂectance or vegetation\
    \ index. The thermal infrared remote sensing\nmethods uses the relationship between\
    \ SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface\ntemperature/vegetation\
    \ index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many\napproximations.\
    \ Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data\
    \ can\nprovide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages\
    \ and weaknesses\nof different approaches are compared and applicable conditions\
    \ as well as key issues in current soil\nmoisture estimation algorithms are discussed.\
    \ Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are\nproposed for future research.\n\
    Keywords: soil moisture (SM); optical and thermal remote sensing; vegetation index;\
    \ land surface\ntemperature\n1. Introduction\nSoil moisture (SM) is an important\
    \ variable in land surface system research, including studies\nof the regional\
    \ water cycle, agricultural irrigation management, climate change and environmental\n\
    monitoring [1–7]. SM links the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere\
    \ and land surface\nand indicates groundwater conditions [8,9]. Additionally,\
    \ SM is used to indicate drought in vegetated\nenvironments because water content\
    \ is an essential factor for vegetation growth [10–12]. This means\nthat SM plays\
    \ an important role in the terrestrial water cycle [13–16]. When soil moisture\
    \ evaporates\ninto the atmosphere, energy exchange occurs between the atmosphere\
    \ and land surface. On the\nother hand, surface water and groundwater are linked\
    \ with the vertical migration of the SM that\nis taken up by vegetation for survival.\
    \ Because the SM plays two vital roles, it is an indispensable\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308; doi:10.3390/s16081308\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n2 of 29\nvariable in terrestrial research. SM estimation studies originated\
    \ in the 1960s because of the limitations\nof measurement equipment and theoretical\
    \ immaturity; however, this research mainly relies on\nempirical relationships\
    \ and point-based experiments [17–19]. In the 1970s and 1980s (corresponding\n\
    with theoretical advances), SM was treated as an important parameter in conjunction\
    \ with other\nsurface parameters in comprehensive studies [20–26]. Since the 1990s,\
    \ several studies have been\nperformed to determine methods for estimating SM\
    \ [27–32]. In addition, due to the advent of remote\nsensing technologies, researchers\
    \ have gradually shifted their attention to monitoring large areas\nby using remotely\
    \ sensed data. Based on the optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, many\n\
    approaches have been developed by establishing relationships between SM and soil\
    \ reﬂectivity or\nsurface temperature/vegetation coverage and soil thermal properties.\
    \ Based on the microwave remote\nsensing, various methods have been proposed for\
    \ the past 35 years [6,33]. For passive microwave\nremote sensing, the representative\
    \ models are GOM [34], POM [34], SPM [34], IEM [35,36], AIEM [37,38],\nQ/H [39,40]\
    \ and Q/P [41] for bare soil area. The representative soil moisture estimation\
    \ models for\nvegetation area are MIMICS model [42], water-cloud model [43], crop\
    \ model [44] and f-k model [45,46].\nDue to the close relationship between backscatter\
    \ coefﬁcients and SM, researchers developed different\nSM modeling efforts from\
    \ active microwave sensors, such as Empirical models [47,48], Semi-empirical\n\
    models [49–51] and Physically-based models [52–54]. At the regional scale, SM\
    \ has been obtained by\nusing remote sensing techniques, which represent a new\
    \ era in soil moisture estimations.\nTraditional\nSM\nobservations\nmainly\ninclude\n\
    single-point\nbased\nor\nspeciﬁc\nlocation\nmeasurements [55–59].\nThe direct\
    \ and most accurate method is the gravimetric method [60].\nThe original soil\
    \ moisture content can be determined from changes in mass. However, this method\
    \ is\ndestructive and cannot be reproduced. Moreover, this method requires a large\
    \ amount of manpower for\nsampling and lab measurements [61]. Time domain reﬂectometry\
    \ (TDR), neutron probes and gamma\nray scanners are subsequently used to indirectly\
    \ measure the SM. These methods are point-based and\ncannot be used as a proxy\
    \ for the regional SM.\nThe development of satellite technology provides a powerful\
    \ method for monitoring the\nspatial-temporal variations of regional SM and provides\
    \ quantitative estimations. Many experts\nhave established different methods for\
    \ retrieving SM based on the relationships between the SM and\nsatellite-derived\
    \ land surface parameters. Using the visible infrared band, the SM can be derived\
    \ from\nthe relationships between soil reﬂectance and different SMs or vegetation\
    \ traits that occur under water\nstress. These methods can be divided into two\
    \ categories, (1) the single spectral analysis method; and\n(2) the vegetation\
    \ index method. For thermal infrared wavebands, the parameters related to the\
    \ soil\nthermal properties are mainly used to derive the SM. This method includes\
    \ two categories, (1) the\nthermal inertia method; and (2) the temperature index\
    \ method. Combining visible and thermal infrared\nremotely sensed data can provide\
    \ more information for estimating soil moisture than the single one.\nSpatial\
    \ and temporal information-based methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\
    It is therefore important to determine how to combine these methods reasonably\
    \ to obtain highly\naccurate SM.\nIn this article, SM estimation methods relying\
    \ on optical and thermal remote sensing are collated\nand summarized. Starting\
    \ from the main methods currently used, the SM estimation status and major\nissues\
    \ are introduced. Next, the physical principles, advantages and existing problems\
    \ regarding the\ndifferent methods are presented in detail. Finally, several recommendations\
    \ are made based on current\nissues faced when estimating SM. The overall framework\
    \ of different remote sensing methods used in\nsoil moisture estimation is summarized\

    \ Estimation from Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing\nAlthough the signal penetration\
    \ capabilities of optical and thermal methods are worse than those of\nthermal\
    \ infrared and microwave methods, the reflectance domain is the most operational\
    \ because the\nimages are easily available over a broad range of ground resolutions\
    \ [77–82]. Wavelengths of 0.4–2.5 µm\nrepresent the radiation of the sun reﬂected\
    \ from the Earth’s surface [83,84]. These approaches mainly\nuse reﬂectance to\
    \ estimate the SM in visible infrared remote sensing techniques. In this paper,\
    \ according\nto the different characteristics used of many bands in visible infrared\
    \ remote sensing, they are divided\ninto the single spectral analysis method and\
    \ vegetation index method.\n2.1. Single Spectral Analysis Method\nThe inﬂuences\
    \ of soil moisture on spectral reﬂectance were observed in early studies [85,86].\n\
    The reﬂectance of water absorption bands is different from that of non-absorption\
    \ bands.\nThe absorption amplitude and presented reﬂectance differences are used\
    \ to establish relationships\nwith soil moisture. From the experimental results\
    \ on many soils with different SMs as early as 1925,\nreﬂectance has been observed\
    \ to decrease as the SM increases [85]. Since then, many scientists have\nreproduced\
    \ this phenomenon and have established empirical relationships between soil reﬂectance\
    \ and\nSM [87,88]. In 1972, Bowers and Smith demonstrated that the absorption\
    \ amplitude was linearly related\nto the SM at the water absorption bands [86].\
    \ Based on experimental results, Jackson et al. [89] found\nthat the albedos of\
    \ all dry soils were approximately two times greater than those of wet soils,\
    \ except for\nsand. By analyzing the water absorption values measured in the near-infrared\
    \ band, Dalal et al. [90]\naccurately estimated the SMs of a large number of soil\
    \ samples. However, the above-mentioned\nmethods are all limited to speciﬁc regions.\
    \ Because of the different physical compositions, soil textures\nand surface roughness\
    \ in different study areas, empirical equations cannot be applied universally.\n\
    Corresponding with the development of monitoring instruments and theoretical advances\n\
    for estimating soil moisture, Jaquemoud et al. [91] developed the SOILSPEC transmission\
    \ model,\nwhich considers soil roughness, viewing angle and the inherent spectral\
    \ characteristics of soil to obtain\nthe bidirectional reﬂectance of the soil\
    \ from 450 nm to 2450 nm. Later, Lobell et al. [92] established\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n4 of 29\na physical model and indicated that an exponential relationship\
    \ exists between soil reﬂectance and\nSM by analyzing the changes in the reﬂectance\
    \ of four different soils at various moisture contents.\nThe model can be expressed\
    \ simply as\nR = f × Rdry + (1 − f ) × Rdry × (−c × s)\n(1)\nwhere Rdry is the\
    \ dry soil reﬂectance, c describes the change rate induced by SM, s is the soil\
    \ saturation,\nand f is the saturation rate.\nLiu et al. [93] applied a simple\
    \ stepwise linear regression method to reduce the band numbers\nand found that\
    \ the soil reﬂectance decreased as the SM increased when the soil moisture was\
    \ low.\nHowever, after the soil moisture reaches the critical point, the reﬂectivity\
    \ increases as the SM increases.\nThis critical point is closely related with\
    \ the soil hydrodynamic characteristics. Based on previous\nstudies, Liu et al.\
    \ [94] evaluated three soil reﬂectance models using 18 soils and the following\
    \ methods:\nthe relative reﬂectivity method, the derivative/difference method\
    \ and the discrete band difference\nmethod. The most applicable method is the\
    \ derivative/difference method because it can be used to\nestimate the SM precisely\
    \ and is less sensitive to external factors, such as the atmosphere and the large\n\
    variation of soil roughness and soil types, etc. Similarly, Whiting et al. [95]\
    \ obtained better results by\nusing the Gaussian model to estimate the SM. Using\
    \ a linear mixed pixel separation algorithm in the\nnear-infrared—red band space,\
    \ Gao et al. [96] used soil line equations and empirical formulas to derive\n\
    the soil reﬂectance of mixed pixels under vegetation cover. Combined with the\
    \ TM images for ﬁeld\nveriﬁcation, this method is applicable at different spatial-temporal\
    \ scales and the results are credible.\nBased on laboratory measurements of soil\
    \ spectral information, single spectral analysis approaches\nare generally used\
    \ to determine the relationships between SM and soil reﬂectance that can obtain\n\
    reasonable results for speciﬁc soil samples. However, in practice, soil reﬂectance\
    \ is affected by many\nfactors, such as vegetation, the atmosphere, etc. The measured\
    \ satellite signals on the surface will\nbe inﬂuenced or reduced, affecting the\
    \ reﬂectance and its operability. In addition, such methods are\nstatistical and\
    \ empirical models that lack physical basis to quantitatively determine the SM.\n\
    2.2. Vegetation Index Method\nBecause it is extremely sensitive to water stress,\
    \ the vegetation index estimated by remote sensing\nhas been widely used to detect\
    \ drought conditions, such as the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI)\
    \ and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [97]. Drought conditions can be reﬂected\
    \ by vegetation\ngrowth, which can be directly represented by the vegetation index.\
    \ By comparing the vegetation index\nat different times, the impacts of drought\
    \ can easily be determined. However, the accuracy of using\nNDVI-based drought\
    \ indices is often subject to changes in vegetation types and ecosystem differences.\n\
    Additionally, the NDVI-based drought index may be a conservative indicator [32]\
    \ because droughts\ncaused by water stress or rainfall anomalies will both have\
    \ time delays [98]. A detailed overview of\nthe drought indices for regional monitoring\
    \ was provided by Richard and Heim [99].\nMany classical drought indices based\
    \ on vegetation indicators were proposed and have been\nwidely used in drought\
    \ monitoring. To remove the inﬂuences of weather and geographic location\ndifferences\
    \ on NDVI, Kogan [100,101] developed the following Vegetation Condition Index\
    \ (VCI)\nbased on statistical NDVI time-series data:\nVCIij = 100 ∗ (NDVIij −\
    \ NDVI − MINj)\nNDVI − MAXj − NDVI − MINj\n(2)\nwhere VCI is a modiﬁed NDVI, vegetation\
    \ condition index; NDVI is a weekly smoothed composite\nNormalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index. NDVI-MIN and NDVI-MAX are the maximum and minimum\nvalues\
    \ of NDVI, respectively, which can be obtained from historical data. i and j denote\
    \ weeks and\nlocations. VCI not only describes the surface vegetation cover and\
    \ spatial-temporal variations but also\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n5 of 29\nquantiﬁes\
    \ the impacts of weather on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to evaluate\
    \ the effects\nof weather on different ecosystems.\nConsidering the error caused\
    \ by the instantaneous vegetation index and using the multi-year\naverage NDVI\
    \ values as criterion, the difference in amplitude was calculated from the NDVI\
    \ values\nobtained over one month or ten days minus the reference value, which\
    \ are positive or negative\nanomalies of the vegetation index. Chen et al. [102]\
    \ developed an anomaly vegetation index (AVI) to\nstudy annual vegetation dynamics.\n\
    The monthly AVI is calculated as follows:\nAMTNDVI = (MTNDVI − MTNDVI)\n(3)\n\
    where AMTNDVI is the anomaly vegetation index, MTNDVI is the average value for\
    \ the same month\nin different years, and MTNDVI is the monthly vegetation index\
    \ for a speciﬁc year.\nBecause its sensitivity to water differs, the relationships\
    \ among different water absorption bands\nwere applied to derive the SM. Gao et\
    \ al. [103] presented a normalized difference water index (NDWI)\nusing the reﬂectance\
    \ at 1.24 µm rather than 0.66 µm because the former is more sensitive to SM.\n\
    More importantly, the NDWI is insensitive to the atmospheric conditions.\nNDWI\
    \ = ρ (0.86 µm) − ρ (1.24 µm)\nρ (0.86 µm) + ρ (1.24 µm)\n(4)\nwhere p is the\
    \ reﬂectance. Based on the NDWI, Wang et al. [104] proposed using the normalized\n\
    multi-band drought index (NMDI), which uses the band differences between the sensitivity\
    \ of 1640 nm\nand 2130 nm for soil and vegetation, respectively, with enhanced\
    \ sensitivity to drought monitoring.\nThe successful application in detecting\
    \ forest ﬁres demonstrated that NMDI can provide a quick\nresponse to moisture\
    \ changes [105,106].\nNMDI = R860 nm − (R1640 nm − R2130 nm)\nR860 nm + (R1640\
    \ nm − R2130 nm)\n(5)\nwhere R is the reﬂectance. Considering the effects on the\
    \ spectral signatures of soil moisture variations,\na new method was developed\
    \ for drought monitoring [107]. Based on the spectral pattern of SM\nchanges in\
    \ the near-infrared–red band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was\
    \ established\nusing ETM reﬂectance (Figure 1).\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308 \n5 of\
    \ 29 \n \nweeks and locations. VCI not only describes the surface vegetation cover\
    \ and spatial-temporal \nvariations but also quantifies the impacts of weather\
    \ on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to \nevaluate the effects of weather\
    \ on different ecosystems. \nConsidering the error caused by the instantaneous\
    \ vegetation index and using the multi-year \naverage NDVI values as criterion,\
    \ the difference in amplitude was calculated from the NDVI values \nobtained over\
    \ one month or ten days minus the reference value, which are positive or negative\
    \ \nanomalies of the vegetation index. Chen et al. [102] developed an anomaly\
    \ vegetation index (AVI) to \nstudy annual vegetation dynamics.  \nThe monthly\
    \ AVI is calculated as follows: \n(\n)\nAMTNDVI\nMTNDVI\nMTNDVI\n\n\n \n(3)\n\
    where AMTNDVI is the anomaly vegetation index, MTNDVI  is the average value for\
    \ the same \nmonth in different years, and MTNDVI is the monthly vegetation index\
    \ for a specific year. \nBecause its sensitivity to water differs, the relationships\
    \ among different water absorption \nbands were applied to derive the SM. Gao\
    \ et al. [103] presented a normalized difference water index \n(NDWI) using the\
    \ reflectance at 1.24 μm rather than 0.66 μm because the former is more sensitive\
    \ to \nSM. More importantly, the NDWI is insensitive to the atmospheric conditions.\

    \ differences between the sensitivity of 1640 \nnm and 2130 nm for soil and vegetation,\
    \ respectively, with enhanced sensitivity to drought \nmonitoring. The successful\
    \ application in detecting forest fires demonstrated that NMDI can \nprovide a\

    \ signatures of soil moisture \nvariations, a new method was developed for drought\

    \ band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was \nestablished using ETM\
    \ reflectance (Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1. Near Infrared–red space and Perpendicular\

    \ soil line can be regarded as a line that characterizes the spectral behavior\n\
    of non-vegetated pixels when the soil moisture content varies noticeably [108].\
    \ The PDI describes the\nSM distribution in the near-infrared—red space. The points\

    \ as follows:\nPDI =\n1\n√\nM2 + 1\n(RRed + MRNIR)\n(6)\nwhere RNIR and RRed denote\
    \ the reﬂectance of near-infrared and red band, respectively; M represents\nthe\
    \ slope of the soil line. The PDI is suitable for bare soil but has many limitations\
    \ in vegetated areas,\nespecially for non-ﬂat regions with different soil types.\n\
    Ghulam et al. [108] introduced fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) for the removal\
    \ of vegetation\ninformation from mixed pixels and proposed the Modiﬁed Perpendicular\
    \ Drought Index—MPDI. If the\nrelationship between the reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ and bare soil is linear, the MPDI can be expressed\nas follows:\nMPDI = RRed\
    \ + MRNIR − fv(Rv,Red + MRv,NIR)\n(1 − fv)\n√\nM2 + 1\n(7)\nwhere Rv,Red and Rv,NIR\
    \ are the vegetation reﬂectances in the red and near-infrared band, respectively,\n\
    generally set to 0.05 and 0.5 by ﬁeld measurements [108]. fv is the vegetation\
    \ cover. By considering\nthe SM status and vegetation growth, the MPDI can be\
    \ applied to vegetated regions to obtain\ncredible results.\nThe vegetation indicator\
    \ method can reﬂect the SM conditions from the vegetation index changes.\nThe\
    \ advantages and disadvantages of these commonly used drought indices are described\
    \ in Table 2.\nBecause the vegetation index cannot immediately reveal information\
    \ when the vegetation is restricted\nby water stress, a long period is required\
    \ to show the water-limited features after some accumulation;\nthus, this method\
    \ requires a certain time lag to show real-time SM conditions. Second, the inter-annual\n\
    changes of land cover types may affect drought monitoring results. Therefore,\
    \ interpretation of the\nmonitoring results should require the latest reliable\
    \ land cover map. Simultaneously, these methods\nonly consider that water stress\
    \ leads to reductions in the NDVI and do not account for other factors,\nsuch\
    \ as changes in temperature and rainfall. In addition, good quality satellite\
    \ data obtained over\na long period of many years must be obtained, and the obtained\
    \ results only reﬂect the SM deﬁcit\nsituation and not the true soil moisture\

    \ many surface temperature studies, the surface temperature variations at the\
    \ thermal wavebands\nor the soil thermal properties were strongly correlated with\
    \ the SM. Due to the special thermal\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n7 of 29\nproperties\
    \ of the soil in the thermal infrared band and its theoretical maturity, SM estimations\
    \ are\ngradually achieved. The thermal inertia and temperature index methods are\
    \ two main methods\nwith their own advantages and disadvantages. The development\
    \ process and their advantages and\nlimitations are introduced in the following.\
    \ Also, some useful references and recommendations\nwere provided.\n3.1. Thermal\
    \ Inertia Method\nAs a property of the substance itself, thermal inertia is often\
    \ used for mineral exploration,\nlithological mapping and geological research.\
    \ Thermal inertia was highly correlated with SM in\nnumerous laboratory experiments\
    \ and is deﬁned as the resistance to temperature variations that is\ninduced by\
    \ exterior energy and controls the amplitude of the temperature change. The higher\
    \ the\nthermal inertia, the less the temperature varies. The relationship between\
    \ thermal inertia and SM can\nbe determined quantitatively from the changes in\
    \ soil temperature or the diurnal amplitude of the\nsurface temperature. Generally,\
    \ thermal inertia includes the soil thermal conductivity and soil heat\ncapacity.\
    \ The soil thermal inertia can be expressed as follows:\nP =\np\nλρC\n(8)\nwhere\
    \ λ is the soil thermal conductivity, ρ is the soil bulk density, and C is the\
    \ soil heat capacity.\nWhen the SM increases, the thermal inertia increases correspondingly\
    \ and reduces the diurnal\namplitude variations of the land surface temperature\
    \ (LST).\n3.1.1. The Physical Analytical Model\nIn geophysical research, soil\
    \ thermal properties and SM show certain relationships [109,110].\nWatson [26]\
    \ ﬁrst proposed physical analytical equations of thermal inertia that were retrieved\
    \ from\nremotely sensed data. The SM was successfully estimated using several\
    \ meteorological elements,\nthe soil moisture proﬁle and remote sensing information.\
    \ In addition, Kahle [23] conducted many\nstudies on thermal inertia models, proposed\
    \ different approaches for solving one-dimensional heat\nconduction equations,\
    \ and attempted to integrate remotely sensed data to estimate thermal inertia\n\
    for large regions. In addition, Price [111] simpliﬁed the latent and sensible\
    \ heat ﬂux expression and\ncombined the surface one-dimensional heat conduction\
    \ equation with the energy balance principle by\nusing Fourier transformation\
    \ to introduce a comprehensive surface parameter B (B is a function of soil\n\
    emissivity, air humidity, temperature and other meteorological factors). Because\
    \ of the requirements\nof a large number of observed ground data in the B solving\
    \ process, this approach is unavailable for\nmany regions.\nMany thermal inertia\
    \ models have treated thermal rock and soil characteristics as a simpliﬁed\nlinear\
    \ function of temperature [23,26]. However, Engman [112] considered that this\
    \ relationship is\nnonlinear and includes factors such as the effects of night\
    \ frost. When combined with microwave data\nto solve the thermal inertia in vegetated\
    \ areas and validate in situ measurements, the obtained results\nwere reasonable\
    \ [113].\nBased on the above-mentioned models, Price [111] proposed using the\
    \ classical apparent thermal\ninertia (ATI) by removing the latent heat of evaporation.\
    \ The ATI can be expressed as follows:\nATI = 1000π\n(1 − α) · C1\nT (1 : 30 p.m.)\
    \ − T (2 : 30 a.m.)\n(9)\nwhere 1000π is used to make the ATI range from 0 to\
    \ 255. C1 is the constant term. T is the land surface\ntemperature, and α is the\
    \ surface albedo.\nThe ATI model is accepted by many scholars, and extensive studies\
    \ have been conducted in different\nareas. Combined with the ATI model and MODIS\
    \ data, Stephen et al. [114] quantitatively estimated\nthe SM and sediment availability\
    \ for a White ShashaQiu field in New Mexico. Verstraeten et al. [115]\nSensors\
    \ 2016, 16, 1308\n8 of 29\nused the ATI model to obtain the SM conditions in Xinjiang\
    \ and the soil moisture content by using\na two-source water balance model at\
    \ a depth of 1 m. The results were veriﬁed by using TDR\nmeasurements, and the\
    \ drought distribution and trends were analyzed in Xinjiang. Frank et al. [116]\n\
    ﬁt the diurnal temperature variation curve of the in-situ measured surface temperature\
    \ in combination\nwith the albedo to obtain the ATI and used AMSR-E soil moisture\
    \ data for validation. The greatest\nadvantage of this method is that surface\
    \ temperature can be obtained from the observation sites,\nwhich is beneﬁcial\
    \ for the equatorial regions. Chang et al. [117] studied the soil moisture conditions\
    \ of\ndifferent types of land in tropical mountains using the ATI model.\nTo accurately\
    \ derive the SM, Chen et al. [118] monitored the spring drought by using the improved\n\
    ATI model for the Hebei Plain. Next, 1 km pure pixels were merged with images\
    \ with 30 m resolution\nfrom the 1st environmental satellite (HJ-1) and the drought\
    \ was accurately monitored in the vegetated\nmixing zone. It was concluded that\
    \ the traditional ATI model was the most suitable for bare land areas\nand that\
    \ the inversion accuracy of the mixed pixels was poor.\nThe physical thermal inertia\
    \ model can provide information regarding hydrothermally relevant\nprinciples\
    \ and the relationships with SM; however, this model requires detailed atmospheric\
    \ forcing\ndata inputs and a complex calculation process. ATI is used as a proxy\
    \ of thermal inertia, and because\nmany factors are truncated, accuracy is often\
    \ not guaranteed. In addition, ATI is not applicable in\nvegetated regions. For\
    \ vegetated areas, FVC should be used to estimate thermal inertia. Moreover, the\n\
    ATI can be combined with other soil moisture indexes to calculate the SM [115].\
    \ Because ATI is simple\nand easy to operate, it is promising for broad applications.\n\
    3.1.2. The Model Based on the Amplitude and Phase Information of LST\nXue and\
    \ Cracknell [119] introduced land surface temperature phase information to simplify\
    \ the\nanalytical thermal inertia model, in which only the ground auxiliary data,\
    \ the time that the maximum\nLST occurs, is required and the real thermal inertia\
    \ can be obtained. This approach greatly simpliﬁes\nthe sophisticated calculation\
    \ process. Thus, many scholars have subsequently estimated SM using this\nmethod.\
    \ Cai et al. [120] used the full thermal inertia model of [119] and a second order\
    \ approximation\napproach to retrieve the thermal inertia surface that was applied\
    \ to north China to monitor the SM\nstatus and achieve good results.\nThe main\
    \ equation of the full model [121] is\nP = (1 − A)S0Ct\n∆T√ω\nA1[cos(ωt2 − δ1)\
    \ − cos(ωt1 − δ1)]\nq\n1 + 1\nb +\n1\n2b2\nδ1 = ωtmax − 2mπ, m = 0, 1, 2 . . .\n\
    (10)\nwhere A is the albedo, S0 is the solar constant. b is a synthesized term.\
    \ Ct is the atmospheric\ntransmittance in the visible spectrum (typically 0.75).\
    \ w is the Earth rotation velocity. δ is the phase\nangle. ∆T is the temperature\
    \ difference. If n = 1, P can reach a maximum value. In addition, t is the\ntime\
    \ at which the maximum LST occurs.\nThe model proposed by Xue and Cracknell requires\
    \ important auxiliary parameters from the\nground-based observations (the time\
    \ of the maximum LST occurs) but, in practical applications, the\nmaximum air\
    \ temperature observation time is used as an input value. Because the maximum\
    \ LST and\nair temperature occurred differently with time, the model induces uncertainties\
    \ by using the maximum\nair temperature. Because polar-orbiting satellites are\
    \ limited by the times that they pass over the same\narea and cannot obtain constant\
    \ observations, the method proposed by Sobrino includes a certain\ndegree of difﬁculty.\
    \ However, the emergence of geostationary satellites would support this method\n\
    and many observations can be obtained for the same study area in one day. In addition,\
    \ the use of\nobservation periods in the model has not been speciﬁcally validated.\n\
    Based on the model proposed by Xue and Cracknell, Sobrino et al. [122,123] developed\
    \ the\nFour Temperature Algorithm (FTA) to calculate soil thermal inertia by using\
    \ three surface temperatures\nat different times on the same day from all the\
    \ calibrated remote sensing results, including viewing\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n\
    9 of 29\ngeometry and atmospheric correction. The results were reasonable and\
    \ veriﬁed for the Iberian\nPeninsula and Morocco.\nThe key process of the FTA\
    \ model is:\nδ1 = arctan(ξ) + (2mπ + 1), m = 0, 1, 2 . . .\nξ =\n(Tj−Tk)[cos(ωti)−cos(ωtj)]−(Ti−Tj)[cos(ωtj)−cos(ωtk)]\n\
    (Ti−Tj)[sin(ωtj)−sin(ωtk)]−(Tj−Tk)[sin(ωti)−sin(ωtj)]\n(11)\nwhere the symbols\
    \ in the above equation is the same as the Equation (10). This method used three\n\
    different time phases to solve the equations, and the phase angle information\
    \ can be written as\na function of LST and satellite overpass time, which eliminates\
    \ the ground auxiliary data; thus,\nthe soil thermal inertia can only be obtained\
    \ from remotely sensed data. Because it is difﬁcult to\nobtain more than two high-quality\
    \ remotely sensed images in one day from remote sensing satellites\n(except geostationary\
    \ satellites) and because of night clouds and atmospheric effects, this method\
    \ has\nencountered many problems in practical applications and is difﬁcult to\
    \ use universally.\nRecently, people actively sought high-accurate methods for\
    \ solving thermal inertia. Wang [106]\nproposed using a simple thermal inertia\
    \ estimation method based on idealized soil temperature to\nobtain an analytical\
    \ solution for diffusion in the sinusoidal form. Thermal inertia can be expressed\
    \ as\na scale factor in a linear relationship between the soil heat ﬂux and surface\
    \ temperature amplitude;\nthus, the estimation accuracy was improved. The biggest\
    \ advantage of this method is that the available\ninput parameters can be easily\
    \ obtained from remotely sensed data. Moreover, fewer model input\nparameters\
    \ are needed and the precision is high.\nMaltese [124] analyzed the applicable\
    \ conditions of a thermal inertia model in sparsely vegetated\nareas and introduced\
    \ a correction factor for cloud effects to rectify downward shortwave radiation.\n\
    The applicability of the thermal inertia model was evaluated under changeable\
    \ weather conditions.\nMeanwhile, Robock et al. [125] studied the data quality\
    \ of a thermal inertia model combined\nwith a two-source model to separate skin\
    \ temperature for vegetation and bare soil and conducted\na sensitivity analysis\
    \ of the input parameters, such as solar radiation and meteorological data.\n\
    The thermal inertia was obtained by using thermal budget model.\n3.1.3. Analysis\
    \ Method Based on Energy Sources\nVerhoef [126] indicated that the direct energy\
    \ source of thermal inertia is soil heat ﬂux rather than\nnet radiation and developed\
    \ a surface temperature difference method between sunset and sunrise for\nsolving\
    \ thermal inertia. If the latent heat ﬂux and sensible heat ﬂux are both zero\
    \ and the net radiation\nremains constant on clear windless nights, the following\
    \ formula can be used:\n(Ch\np\nDh)r = 2\n\f\fRn\n\f\f √\n∆t\n∆Ts\n√π\n(12)\n\
    where\n\f\fRn\n\f\f is the average net radiation ﬂux between sunset and sunrise\
    \ (W·m−2), ∆t is the time\ninterval (s), and ∆Ts is the decrease in LST between\
    \ sunset and sunrise (◦C), Ch is the soil heat capacity\n(MJ·m−3·K−1), Dh is the\
    \ thermal diffusivity (m2·s−1).\nBy comparing different methods to estimate thermal\
    \ inertia and soil heat ﬂux, Murray and\nVerhoef [127–129] conﬁrmed that this\
    \ approach is relatively simple and reliable. However, because\nof the harsh applicable\
    \ conditions, this method has rarely been used. First, this method requires\n\
    a clear and windless night with constant net radiation. These weather conditions\
    \ are generally difﬁcult\nto satisfy. In addition, it is difﬁcult to guarantee\
    \ image quality at night, which results in incorrect\nestimation results.\nSensors\
    \ 2016, 16, 1308\n10 of 29\n3.1.4. Remote Sensing Methods Combined with Soil Physical\
    \ Parameters\nA relationship with soil moisture can be established based on the\
    \ deﬁnition of thermal inertia if\nsoil characteristics and remotely sensed data\
    \ are available for estimating thermal inertia. Lu et al. [130]\nproposed using\
    \ a simple model that considers the soil solid composition and other known pivotal\
    \ soil\ncharacteristics, such as soil composition and density.\nThe main equations\
    \ are calculated as follows:\nP = Pdry + (Psat − Pdry)Kp\n(13)\nKp = exp[γ(1 −\
    \ Sγ−δ\nr\n)]\n(14)\nwhere Pdry and Psat are the dry and wet soil thermal inertia,\
    \ respectively, and Kp is the Kersten correction\nfunction. γ and δ were soil\
    \ texture dependent model parameters and Sr was the degree of saturation.\nIn\
    \ addition, Verstraeten et al. [106] used the apparent thermal inertia and soil\
    \ moisture\nsaturation index (SMSI) combined with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)\
    \ data to estimate the\nSM. When verifying the analysis by using in-situ data\
    \ and the microwave moisture content, the results\nshowed that the values and\
    \ trends ﬁt well. M. Minacapilli [131,132] normalized the Kp function by\nusing\
    \ ATI with remotely sensed data to obtain the actual thermal inertia based on\
    \ the soil porosity.\nThermal inertia methods focus on soil thermal characteristics\
    \ and have clear physical meanings\nthat are relatively easy to understand. Different\
    \ methods are compared in Table 3. In practical\napplications, clear day and night\
    \ images are difﬁcult to obtain for the same area of interest because of\nclouds,\
    \ and the accuracy for night image is difﬁcult to conﬁrm. Simultaneously, the\
    \ assumption that\nthe soil properties at the horizontal and vertical scale are\
    \ consistent is not readily satisﬁed. Moreover, in\nareas with high vegetation\
    \ cover, vegetation conceals the soil information, which affects the estimation\n\
    accuracy. Thus, this method is only applicable to bare and sparsely vegetated\
    \ areas.\nTable 3. Comparisons of the common thermal inertia methods.\nMethods\n\

    \ is one control parameter for the physical and biological processes that\noccur\
    \ at the land surface. For bare soil area, LST refers to the soil surface temperature;\
    \ and for densely\nvegetated areas, the LST indicates the vegetation canopy temperature\
    \ under the assumption of energy\nbalance. An increase in the vegetation canopy\
    \ temperature is an initial indicator that the vegetation is\nsubject to water\
    \ stress. Therefore, the LST can be used to monitor the SM.\nSensors 2016, 16,\
    \ 1308\n11 of 29\n3.2.1. Normalized Difference Temperature Index\nConsidering\
    \ the seasonal variations of the LST, Mcvicar et al. [133] developed the normalized\n\
    difference temperature index (NDTI) to reﬂect the SM conditions. The NDTI is calculated\
    \ as follows:\nNDTI = (LST∞ − LST)/(LST∞ − LST0)\n(15)\nwhere LST∞ and LST0 are\
    \ the simulated LSTs of the inﬁnite and zero surface impedance, respectively,\n\
    which are the upper (extremely dry state) and lower (extremely wet state) boundary\
    \ conditions for the\nLST at speciﬁc atmospheric forcing and surface impedance.\
    \ The surface energy balance principle and\naerodynamic impedance model can be\
    \ used to obtain the extreme LSTs.\nNDTI eliminates the effects of the seasonal\
    \ variations of LST. The SM is very similar to the\nNDTI [134]. Thus, the NDTI\
    \ can accurately reﬂect the spatial-temporal variations of SM. However, this\n\
    model requires solar radiation, wind speed and LAI as input values, which could\
    \ limit the operability\nof the model.\n3.2.2. Crop Water Stress Index\nSoil water\
    \ availability is a basic variable for the evapotranspiration process. In addition,\
    \ the SM\naffects the evapotranspiration rate. Evapotranspiration and energy are\
    \ closely related to the SM.\nWhen the energy is high and the SM is sufﬁcient,\
    \ strong evapotranspiration occurs and the canopy\ntemperature is lower. By contrast,\
    \ evapotranspiration is weak and the canopy temperature increases\nwhen the vegetation\
    \ is subjected to water stress. For a speciﬁc atmospheric condition, the ratio\
    \ of\nactual and potential evapotranspiration can be used as a proxy for crop\
    \ water stress. Based on the\nsurface energy balance model, Jackson et al. [135]\
    \ proposed using the crop water stress index (CWSI)\nto mirror the ratio between\
    \ vegetation transpiration and maximum potential evaporation. The CWSI\nis obtained\
    \ from the vegetation canopy temperature, ambient air temperature and net solar\
    \ radiation.\nThe CWSI formula is shown as follows:\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc −\
    \ Ta)min\n(Tc − Ta)max − (Tc − Ta)min\n(16)\nwhere Tc is the vegetation canopy\
    \ temperature, Ta is the air temperature, and (Tc–Ta)max and (Tc–Ta)min\nare the\
    \ difference between the canopy and air temperature without transpiration and\
    \ potential\nevaporation, respectively.\nThe CWSI uses thermal infrared temperatures\
    \ and meteorological data to indirectly reﬂect the SM\nunder crops. This method\
    \ has clear physical meaning based on the surface energy balance principle.\n\
    In addition, this method is highly precise in regions covered by vegetation and\
    \ the estimation accuracy\nis higher than that of the thermal inertia method [136].\
    \ However, the CWSI was established based on\nthe single canopy energy balance\
    \ model, which is less effective for early crop growth. In addition,\nthis approach\
    \ requires meteorological data and the calculation process is complex. Furthermore,\n\
    the extrapolation methods used for meteorological data, which are mainly obtained\
    \ from ground\nweather stations, have important impacts on the accuracies of the\
    \ CWSI determinations.\n4. SM Estimations from Visible and Thermal Infrared Remote\
    \ Sensing Data\n4.1. The Spatial Information-Based Method\nMany studies have demonstrated\
    \ that LST and VI (vegetation index/vegetation coverage) can\nprovide vegetation\
    \ water stress conditions and SM information [137–148]. If the number of pixels\
    \ in\nthe study area is sufﬁcient and the clouds and water bodies are removed,\
    \ the spatial distribution of\nLST and VI constitute triangular or trapezoidal\
    \ feature space. The SM can be obtained from the pixel\ndistribution in the LST-VI\
    \ feature space.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n12 of 29\nBecause the surface energy\
    \ maintains balance in the LST-VI feature space, lower latent heat ﬂux\nresults\
    \ in more available energy for the surface sensible heat ﬂux. For transpiration,\
    \ which is a crucial\nparameter, the stomatal resistance is inﬂuenced by the soil\
    \ moisture availability. In sparsely vegetated\nregions, the thermal soil inertia\
    \ affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into the soil and\n\
    the soil heat ﬂux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a function of soil\
    \ type and soil moisture\nvariations [151]. In addition, the surface available\
    \ energy (Rn-G) also inﬂuences the LST. The control\nof the surface temperature\
    \ by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation areas have lower\ntemperatures.\
    \ In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil type, soil moisture and\
    \ vegetation cover.\nFurthermore, incident radiation affects transpiration and\
    \ stomatal resistance, and the net radiation can\nbe decomposed to sensible and\
    \ latent heat ﬂux. The transfer of energy as heat from the surface to the\natmosphere\
    \ is an important component for surface temperature and explains why the temperatures\n\
    in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness are lower than those in areas\
    \ with bare soil, which\ninﬂuences the shape of the LST-VI space.\nThe LST-VI\
    \ feature space is restricted by the dry and wet edges. The wet edge in the feature\n\
    space represents maximum evapotranspiration and adequate soil moisture and the\
    \ dry edge indicates\nthat the vegetation is subjected to water stress in which\
    \ evapotranspiration reaches the minimum and\nthe SM is 0 (no water can be used).\
    \ For different vegetation types, the dry edge includes the driest\npoints and\
    \ the vegetation evapotranspiration varies depending on the amount of vegetation\
    \ coverage.\nFor certain types, the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly\
    \ equal. Because cooling affects\nevaporation, the surface temperature is maximized\
    \ at the dry edge and minimized at the wet edge.\nDifferent views of the surface\
    \ temperature in the fully vegetated area resulted in the development of\nthe\
    \ triangular and trapezoidal methods. The triangular method assumes that the surface\
    \ temperatures\nof fully vegetated areas are equal to the wettest surface temperature.\
    \ However, the trapezoidal method\nassumes that the surface temperatures of fully\
    \ vegetated surfaces are much higher than those of the\nwettest surface.\n4.1.1.\
    \ The Triangle Method\nWith the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price\
    \ [152] ﬁrst proposed the concept of\ntriangular space. The triangle method is\
    \ proposed based on surface temperatures and VI scatter plots\nobtained using\
    \ satellites (Figure 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface\
    \ model,\nthe simulated feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing\
    \ the position of the image element\nin space to infer the SM.\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308 \n12 of 29 \n \ncrucial parameter, the stomatal resistance is influenced\
    \ by the soil moisture availability. In sparsely \nvegetated regions, the thermal\
    \ soil inertia affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into \n\
    the soil and the soil heat flux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a\
    \ function of soil type and \nsoil moisture variations [151]. In addition, the\
    \ surface available energy (Rn-G) also influences the \nLST. The control of the\
    \ surface temperature by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation \nareas\
    \ have lower temperatures. In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil\
    \ type, soil moisture \nand vegetation cover. Furthermore, incident radiation\
    \ affects transpiration and stomatal resistance, \nand the net radiation can be\
    \ decomposed to sensible and latent heat flux. The transfer of energy as \nheat\
    \ from the surface to the atmosphere is an important component for surface temperature\
    \ and \nexplains why the temperatures in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness\
    \ are lower than \nthose in areas with bare soil, which influences the shape of\
    \ the LST-VI space. \nThe LST-VI feature space is restricted by the dry and wet\
    \ edges. The wet edge in the feature \nspace represents maximum evapotranspiration\
    \ and adequate soil moisture and the dry edge \nindicates that the vegetation\
    \ is subjected to water stress in which evapotranspiration reaches the \nminimum\
    \ and the SM is 0 (no water can be used). For different vegetation types, the\
    \ dry edge \nincludes the driest points and the vegetation evapotranspiration\
    \ varies depending on the amount of \nvegetation coverage. For certain types,\
    \ the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly equal. \nBecause cooling affects\
    \ evaporation, the surface temperature is maximized at the dry edge and \nminimized\
    \ at the wet edge. Different views of the surface temperature in the fully vegetated\
    \ area \nresulted in the development of the triangular and trapezoidal methods.\
    \ The triangular method \nassumes that the surface temperatures of fully vegetated\
    \ areas are equal to the wettest surface \ntemperature. However, the trapezoidal\
    \ method assumes that the surface temperatures of fully \nvegetated surfaces are\
    \ much higher than those of the wettest surface.  \n4.1.1. The Triangle Method\
    \ \nWith the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price [152] first proposed\
    \ the concept of \ntriangular space. The triangle method is proposed based on\
    \ surface temperatures and VI scatter \nplots obtained using satellites (Figure\
    \ 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface \nmodel, the simulated\
    \ feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing the position of the\
    \ image \nelement in space to infer the SM.  \n \nFigure 2. The idealized triangle\
    \ space between Ts and Fv [138]. \nThe LST-VI triangular feature space established\
    \ under the full ranges of SM and vegetation is \ncharacteristic of a space bounded\
    \ with an upper decreasing envelope and a lower nearly horizontal \nenvelope with\
    \ increasing vegetation cover and with two envelopes ultimately intersecting at\
    \ a \n(truncated) point of full vegetation cover [153]. Price [152] presented\
    \ the LST-VI triangular space \nusing satellite remotely sensed AVHRR data and\
    \ analyzed the impacts of cirrus on soil moisture. \nNemani [147] studied the\
    \ scale effects of the LST-VI space and its orographic influences on LST and \n\
    VI and indicated that vegetation type and topography are two decisive factors.\
    \ Similarly, Clark [142] \napplied multi-spectral data to monitor drought and\
    \ presented an empirical model. Mallick [154] \nFigure 2. The idealized triangle\

    Nemani [147] studied the scale effects of the LST-VI space and its orographic\
    \ inﬂuences on LST and\nVI and indicated that vegetation type and topography are\
    \ two decisive factors. Similarly, Clark [142]\napplied multi-spectral data to\
    \ monitor drought and presented an empirical model. Mallick [154]\nretrieved SM\
    \ using the triangle method at the ﬁeld and landscapes scales by using ASTER and\
    \ MODIS,\nrespectively. Both results were reasonable. The inversion accuracy is\
    \ much lower for high spatial\nresolution images because it is more difﬁcult to\
    \ reﬂect heterogeneity within the pixels.\nThe main assumptions of the triangle\
    \ method are that (1) the complete underlying vegetation\ncover from the bare\
    \ soil to full vegetation is know; (2) the variations in the space are not primarily\n\
    caused by differences in atmospheric conditions but are caused by variations in\
    \ the available SM;\nand (3) the sensitivity of LST to the canopy and soil is\
    \ different. Due to the special characteristic of\ntriangular space, the major\
    \ advantages of this method include the following: (1) it can estimate the\nSM\
    \ from entirely remotely sensed data without any ground auxiliary data; and (2)\
    \ it is simple and\neasy to operate and can monitor drought conditions over large\
    \ regions. Meanwhile, the limitations\ninclude the following: (1) the LST-VI space\

    \ pixels is large enough to span a wide range of soil wetness and vegetation cover\
    \ in\nthe study area; and (3) many limitations occur in regions that are not ﬂat.\n\
    4.1.2. The Trapezoid Method\nUsing experiments, Jackson [155] explored the relationships\
    \ between drought and differences in\nvegetation leaf and air temperature by using\
    \ measured data and proposed a drought index—CWSI.\nTo calculate the pixel values\
    \ of intermediate vegetation cover and SM for a speciﬁc time, four vertices of\n\
    the trapezoid are required that correspond to (1) well-watered, full-cover vegetation;\
    \ (2) water-stressed,\nfull-cover vegetation; (3) saturated bare soil; and (4)\
    \ dry bare soil. These values should be computed\nﬁrst by using the CWSI theory\
    \ and Penman-Monteith equation. This index can only be used for fully\nvegetated\
    \ areas and is not applicable in sparsely vegetated areas.\nBased on the theory\
    \ of the CWSI, Moran [31] developed the water deﬁcit index (WDI) (Figure 3) to\n\
    overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. This index can be used in all areas\
    \ covered by vegetation\nand in areas with sparse vegetation. Relying on the surface\
    \ energy balance principle, the soil adjusted\nvegetation index (SAVI) and the\
    \ temperature difference form a trapezoidal space, and the index can\nbe directly\
    \ calculated from remotely sensed data without requirements for measuring leaf\
    \ and air\ntemperature. After the model test and in situ data validation, the\
    \ WDI was evaluated to overestimate\nthe water deﬁcit situations in many sparsely\
    \ vegetated regions.\nCompared with the triangular space, the trapezoidal space\
    \ does not require a large number of\npixels. The advantages of the trapezoidal\
    \ method are that (1) it has a robust physical basis and that\n(2) the space determined\
    \ from the four vertices is the main limiting condition that is close to the true\n\
    conditions of the land surface. In contrast, the disadvantages include that this\
    \ method (1) requires\nmore ground-based parameters to calculate the soil moisture\
    \ index and that (2) the inﬂuences of water\nstress on vegetation cover have a\

    \ Accurate estimation results were achieved for specific atmospheric conditions.\
    \ The main \nadvantages of this method include the following: (1) the proposed\
    \ model is independent on the soil \ntypes; (2) the quantitative SM is determined\
    \ by using the method rather than from the empirical \nrelationship between SM\
    \ and the remotely sensed parameters; and (3) the diurnal changes of the \nland\
    \ surface parameters are used rather than the instantaneous parameters that have\
    \ many \nuncertainties at some moments. However, the limitations of the proposed\
    \ model are discussed \nbelow. (1) The model is suitable for bare soils on cloudless\
    \ days and the accuracy is greatly reduced \nin the vegetated areas. This reduction\
    \ in accuracy occurs because the elliptical shape constructed by \nthe NSSR and\
    \ LST appears under bare soil conditions. When the surface is covered by vegetation,\
    \ \nthe surface energy distribution is more complex than that of the bare soil\
    \ and the elliptical shape is \naffected by the vegetation interference; (2) the\
    \ coefficients of the proposed model change with \natmospheric conditions. Thus,\
    \ it is difficult to fix to the coefficients to establish a universal equation\
    \ \nfor estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire these model parameters at\
    \ the regional scale must \nbe addressed before applying the proposed SM model\
    \ to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, \nthese two problems are important\
    \ issues that concern the application of the model with remotely \nsensed observations\
    \ and are promising as a foundation for future work. Moreover, investigating the\
    \ \nrelationships between the model parameters and atmospheric conditions is probably\
    \ a promising \navenue for making the SM retrieval model universal.  \n5. Current\
    \ Problems and Discussions \nDespite significant progress made since the 1960s\
    \ in SM retrieval methods, from empirical \nsimplified equations to more complex\
    \ physically based models using remote sensing technology, \nand to estimate regional\
    \ SM and resulting in many SM missions (as shown in Table 4), many \nproblems\
    \ have still not been solved. These problems are mainly associated with the input\
    \ \nparameters of SM models, the estimation accuracy and the physical interpretation\
    \ of different \nsurface variables from satellite data at the temporal and spatial\
    \ data/model scales, and the validation \nof SM obtained from remotely sensed\
    \ data at the regional/global scale. These issues will be discussed \nbriefly\

    \ (3) the diurnal changes of the land surface parameters\nare used rather than\
    \ the instantaneous parameters that have many uncertainties at some moments.\n\
    However, the limitations of the proposed model are discussed below. (1) The model\
    \ is suitable for bare\nsoils on cloudless days and the accuracy is greatly reduced\
    \ in the vegetated areas. This reduction in\naccuracy occurs because the elliptical\
    \ shape constructed by the NSSR and LST appears under bare\nsoil conditions. When\
    \ the surface is covered by vegetation, the surface energy distribution is more\n\
    complex than that of the bare soil and the elliptical shape is affected by the\
    \ vegetation interference;\n(2) the coefﬁcients of the proposed model change with\
    \ atmospheric conditions. Thus, it is difﬁcult to\nﬁx to the coefﬁcients to establish\
    \ a universal equation for estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire\nthese\
    \ model parameters at the regional scale must be addressed before applying the\
    \ proposed SM\nmodel to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, these two problems\
    \ are important issues that concern\nthe application of the model with remotely\
    \ sensed observations and are promising as a foundation for\nfuture work. Moreover,\
    \ investigating the relationships between the model parameters and atmospheric\n\
    conditions is probably a promising avenue for making the SM retrieval model universal.\n\

    \ Used in Soil Moisture Estimation Models\nThe accuracy of the estimated SM is\
    \ inﬂuenced by the input variables that must be accurately\nobtained from in situ\
    \ measurements or remote sensing. Inaccurate input parameters can induce many\n\
    uncertainties in soil moisture estimations. For example, one advantage of the\
    \ model proposed by Xue\nand Cracknell [182] is to apply the variations in the\
    \ surface temperature phase to estimate thermal\ninertia. However, in the derivation\
    \ process, the equation requires a priori knowledge of the time\nat which the\
    \ maximum LST occurs. In practical applications, authors always use the maximum\
    \ air\ntemperature observed at ground meteorological stations instead, since the\
    \ maximum air temperature\nis easy to obtain. In addition, according to previous\
    \ studies, the maximum LST is lower than the\nmaximum air temperature by up to\
    \ 4–5 ◦C [155]. Thus, accurate maximum air temperature estimation\nusing the remotely\
    \ sensed data provides an effective means to obtain precise real thermal inertia.\n\
    In addition, based on the model proposed by Xue, Sobrino et al. developed a new\
    \ remotely sensed\nmodel, the FTA model, to estimate thermal inertia by using\
    \ the phase differences between the different\noverpass times of the NOAA satellite.\
    \ Current problems include: (1) the polar-orbiting satellite data\ncannot satisfy\
    \ the requirements of high quality images; and (2) the observed surface times\
    \ are 2:30,\n7:30, 14:30 and 19:30, respectively, and the surface difference is\
    \ obtained at 2:30 and 14:30. The phase\ndifferences are determined at 7:30, 14:30\
    \ and 19:30. In addition, with the development of the satellites,\nthe geostationary\
    \ meteorological satellite can provide many data in one day, which can compensate\
    \ for\nthe limitations of polar-orbiting satellites. Moreover, large errors can\
    \ be induced by the LSTs twice each\nday to simulate the daily LST variations,\
    \ and more data are required to simulate the diurnal variations\nin surface temperature\
    \ [183].\nThe accuracy of the input parameters partially determined the robustness\
    \ of the SM estimation\nmodels. In practical applications, many studies have ignored\
    \ the limitations of these models or have\nselected approximate parameters. Consequently,\
    \ although the soil moisture estimation can satisfy\na certain degree of accuracy,\
    \ they are usually not used correctly. Soil moisture estimation models\nare obtained\
    \ using many preconditions and assumptions. Therefore, model selection based on\
    \ the\nunderlying conditions and the required input parameters is very important.\
    \ It is worth noting that\nthe mismatch in scale between the point-based observations\
    \ and the remotely sensed data remains\na problem to be solved.\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n17 of 29\n5.2. Soil Moisture under Vegetation\nThe sensors receive\
    \ the composite signal from the surface, which includes the soil and vegetation.\n\
    In the vegetated regions, removing the vegetation effect to estimate SM becomes\
    \ a problem. Currently,\none-source models consider the soil and vegetation as\
    \ a composite leaf that is called the big leaf\nmodel. These models cannot separate\
    \ the soil from the mixed remotely sensed pixels. Thus, the\nSM in the vegetated\
    \ area is manifested by the vegetation index or temperature vegetation dryness\n\
    index. However, the quantitative SM is not easy to be obtained under vegetation\
    \ cover. To solve the\nabove-mentioned problems, two-source models (such as ALEXI,\
    \ N95 et al.) were used to separate\nthe soil and vegetation information and describe\
    \ the energy exchange among the soil, vegetation and\natmosphere. The SM may be\
    \ accurately estimated if pure soil information can be separated from the\ncomposite\
    \ context.\nAdditionally, because many soil physical parameters cannot be obtained\
    \ by using remotely\nsensed data, this method only can use empirical equations\
    \ or in situ measurements to determine these\nvariables. Soil texture information\
    \ exhibits considerable heterogeneity and is difﬁcult to obtain for large\nregions.\
    \ In addition, it is difﬁcult to establish a universal relationship for SM across\
    \ different study\nareas. To simplify the physical formula and facilitate calculation,\
    \ the soil physical variables can be\nparameterized to establish a correlation\
    \ with the obtained variables from remote sensing. This method\nmay be ultimately\
    \ a robust method that not only considers the soil physical properties but also\
    \ can be\nrealized using remote sensing techniques.\n5.3. Uncertain Quantitative\
    \ Relationships between the Remotely Sensed Indices/Thermal Inertia and SM\nNo\
    \ determinate quantitative relationships between the thermal inertia/drought indices\
    \ and SM\nare widely accepted by all the experts. However, many authors have considered\
    \ this linear relationship\nas a simple method for determining SM. Several authors\
    \ have indicated that these variables are not\nlinearly related in empirical statistical\
    \ experiments. Currently, the commonly applied equations are\nlinear or exponential.\
    \ However, although the SM estimation methods have matured and the thermal\ninertia/drought\
    \ indices can be determined relatively accurately, determining the SM from thermal\n\
    inertia/drought indices remains uncertain. Thus, a universal and quantitative\
    \ relationship between\nthe SM and thermal inertia/drought indices must be accurately\
    \ determined.\n5.4. Lack of Surface Data for Validating Remotely Sensed SM\nRemotely\
    \ sensed soil moisture validation is a problem in SM estimation research. The\
    \ most\ncommonly used methods are validated by single point-based or multiple\
    \ point-based measurements.\nIn addition, many researchers have attempted to use\
    \ up-scaling or down-scaling methods to validate\nSM estimates from remote sensing\
    \ data [184]. Remotely sensed data have wide spatial coverage of the\nunderlying\
    \ surface, such as 30 m, 1 km, or even several kilometers. In addition, the retrieved\
    \ SM is\nthe pixel value of the satellite data that indicates the situation of\
    \ the entire region. However, surface\nmeasurements are always conducted at single\
    \ points and cannot represent the entire region due to the\nspatial and temporal\
    \ changes of the SM [185]. Remotely sensed SMs are frequently validated by many\n\
    measured point values in study areas, which results in many uncertainties. Moreover,\
    \ the developed\nSM indices serve as proxies that indicate drought conditions\
    \ and are not true SM contents. To obtain\nthe actual SM, the wilting and saturation\
    \ points of the soil in the study area must be known, which can\nresult in errors.\
    \ Therefore, a surface-to-surface validation method should be developed to solve\
    \ this\nproblem. Aerial photography or UAV may provide the actual state of the\
    \ ground surface, which could\nbe used to verify the derived SM.\n5.5. Uncertainties\
    \ in the Application of Soil Moisture Estimation Models\nAs described above, each\
    \ soil moisture estimation model is developed with preconditions and\nassumptions.\
    \ Many uncertainties are introduced by key processes when applying soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2016, 16, 1308\n18 of 29\nestimation models. For example, the spatial-information\
    \ based method includes two important\nprocesses, determining the limiting edge\
    \ and interpolation between the dry and wet edges.\nFirst, determining the dry\
    \ and wet edges is important for estimating soil moisture from the LST-VI\nspace,\
    \ which directly affects the retrieval accuracy. In practice, most studies use\
    \ the least squares\nmethod to directly ﬁt scattering at the dry and wet edge.\
    \ However, due to underlying heterogeneity and\ndifferent atmospheric forcing,\
    \ the extracted wet and dry edges are unstable and introduce uncertainties,\n\
    which eventually lead to SM estimation errors. Currently, two main methods are\
    \ used to derive the\ndry and wet edges from scattering in the feature space,\
    \ the auto-determined edge algorithm and the\ntheoretical edge determination method.\
    \ The main advantages of the auto-determined edge method\nare that it is simple\
    \ to operate, highly accurate, and has wide application. However, one limitation\
    \ is\nthat the auto-determined edges are changeable with the size of the study\
    \ area and that the extreme dry\nand wet points must all be present in the LST-VI\
    \ space. Sometimes, true dry or wet edges do not exist\nbecause energy and water\
    \ balance must be met under extreme conditions. Thus, many experts have\ntried\
    \ to derive theoretical edges based on the surface energy balance principle as\
    \ a boundary condition.\nThe auto-determined edge method can be used to estimate\
    \ soil moisture from remote sensing data\nbut results in large errors due to its\
    \ subjectivity and the effects of atmospheric conditions. The surface\nenergy\
    \ balance method for solving theoretical edges has a robust physical basis because\
    \ the requirement\nfor more underlying surface auxiliary data results in a complicated\
    \ calculation process. It is difﬁcult\nto obtain pure remote sensing data, and\
    \ many parameters introduce uncertainty. Therefore, a simple\nand applicable method\
    \ for remote sensing to obtain theoretical dry and wet edges is a promising\n\
    approach. The two-source models can provide wizards for solving this problem that\
    \ can separate\nthe soil and vegetation surface temperatures. This method can\
    \ be used to obtain a true dry point for\nbare soil and full vegetation before\
    \ deriving theoretically limiting edges by using an energy balance\nmodel. Second,\
    \ many authors have found that LST and SM are negatively correlated in the LST-VI\n\
    space; thus, numerous studies have been based on the assumption that surface temperature\
    \ and soil\nmoisture vary linearly with changes in vegetation cover [141]. However,\
    \ Carlson et al. [186] observed\nthat this change is not linear according to the\
    \ SVAT model simulation. In practical applications, most\nscholars still assume\
    \ that the soil moisture varies linearly in the scatter space. The interpolation\
    \ of the\nfeature space represents the relationships among SM, LST and FVC. The\
    \ linear interpolation is simple\nand easy to operate but cannot truly reﬂect\
    \ the SM variations in the feature space [187]. Although the\nnon-linear interpolation\
    \ is complex and difﬁcult to operate, it is highly accurate [188]. Thus, how can\n\
    we develop a method to interpolate the space based on a physical mechanism and\
    \ the SM? Thermal\ninertia is a physical property of the substance itself. Thus,\
    \ if thermal inertia is too complicated to use,\nthe ATI could be used to replace\
    \ it. The ATI may be helpful for interpolating the feature space in\nfuture research.\n\
    In summary, comprehensive analyses of the aforementioned SM estimation methods\
    \ based on\noptical and thermal remote sensing were performed. Although remote\
    \ multi-monitoring and inversion\nmethods involve different types of ﬁelds and\
    \ relatively broad scopes, they have many shortcomings.\nIn general, despite their\
    \ susceptibility to clouds, vegetation effects and limited penetration, optical\
    \ and\nthermal remote sensing data have high spatial resolutions with multi-satellite\
    \ sensors and large spatial\ncoverage. Moreover, soil moisture and surface temperatures\
    \ are strongly correlated. Thus, soil moisture\nestimations are more promising.\
    \ Although some models are relatively simple and have clear physical\nmeaning,\
    \ some methods, such as thermal inertia and apparent thermal inertia methods,\
    \ are mainly\nsuitable for bare soils or for early crop growth conditions. In\
    \ addition, due to the impacts of soil texture\nand type, the relationships between\
    \ thermal inertia and soil moisture are often nonlinear. However,\nthe method\
    \ is derived under certain assumptions, and the effects of these assumptions on\
    \ the retrieval\nresults must be further validated. The triangle/trapezoid method\
    \ mainly uses the spatial distribution\nof pixel information when the requirements\
    \ of study area are large enough and contain a variety of\nground conditions,\
    \ including different vegetation coverage and soil moisture. In some cases, this\n\
    condition is not easily satisﬁed. The temporal information-based methods require\
    \ observation data for\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n19 of 29\nlong time series from\
    \ remote sensing on cloudy days. Additionally, the simulated model accuracy and\n\
    subjective cognitive and empirical descriptions for the study area affect the\
    \ inversion results. Due to\nexisting problems, some recommendations or solutions\
    \ may provide references for SM estimations,\nas described below.\n6. Conclusions\
    \ and Perspective\nWith the problems pointed out above, this paper proposes our\
    \ recommendation and potential\nsolution in SM estimations.\n6.1. Combining Optical\
    \ and Microwave Remote Sensing to Estimate SM\nVisible and thermal infrared remote\
    \ sensing has ﬁne spatial resolutions and broad coverage.\nThe primary differences\
    \ between these methods are the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and\nthe source\
    \ of the electromagnetic energy [84]. Visible infrared remote sensing uses characteristic\n\
    changes in the soil reﬂectance or vegetation physiology to estimate SM. By contrast,\
    \ thermal infrared\nremote sensing uses the responses of soil thermal properties\
    \ to soil moisture to determine SM.\nUsing integration, the SM may be estimated\
    \ from soil thermal properties (soil temperature, thermal\ninertia, etc.) and\
    \ soil spectrum differences (absorption amplitude, spectrum combination, etc.).\n\
    In addition, microwave remote sensing is less disturbed by the bad weather or\
    \ rain. However,\nit can be easily perturbed by vegetation, and optical and thermal\
    \ remote sensing can be helpful for\nremoving vegetation disturbances. Therefore,\
    \ the combination of optical and thermal and microwave\nremote sensing may have\
    \ broad application prospects. Additionally, microwave remote sensing can\nobtain\
    \ data all-time and all-weather, which can provide great help for soil moisture\
    \ products over long\ntime series, especially in humid tropical regions.\nMoreover,\
    \ the combination of the thermal inertia method and the LST-NDVI space method\
    \ may\nprovide a robust method for estimating the SM. Thermal inertia is a soil\
    \ physical property with\nsoil moisture, and the LST-NDVI method can restrict\
    \ changes in soil moisture in a speciﬁc space.\nThis combination has a strong\
    \ physical basis, is easy to operate, and may be promising.\n6.2. The Development\
    \ of Comparable Soil Moisture Indices\nCurrently, many drought indices are based\
    \ on instantaneous remotely sensed data that cannot be\ncompared with other data\
    \ because of the inﬂuences of different atmospheric conditions. For visible\n\
    infrared remote sensing, long time-series remote sensing data are difﬁcult to\
    \ obtain and the reference\nstandards are not properly determined. For thermal\
    \ infrared remote sensing, the derived indices\ncan represent the drought conditions\
    \ of the study area for a speciﬁc time but cannot be compared\nwith each other\
    \ day by day. The driest and wettest points may not exist in the study area. Thus,\n\
    determining the dry and wet edge is somewhat subjective and results in errors\
    \ in the soil moisture\nestimations. For this problem, the normalization method\
    \ can be used to normalize the indices to\na uniform reference or statistical\
    \ data can be used to standardize the indices. Only the drought indices\nfrom\
    \ a uniform reference can be physically compared with each other and accurately\
    \ reﬂect the true\nsoil moisture conditions.\n6.3. The Measured Surface Data for\
    \ True Validation\nTrue validation is the process of assessing the uncertainty\
    \ of the data products derived\nindependently from the system outputs for the\
    \ same scale, time and location. Without validation,\nany methods, models, algorithms,\
    \ and parameters derived from remotely sensed data cannot be\nused with conﬁdence\
    \ [189,190]. True validation must be conducted because validation can help\nunderstand\
    \ the uncertainties of the remotely sensed data, the errors in soil moisture inversion\
    \ models\nand uncertainty in the retrieved land surface variables.\nCurrently,\
    \ the estimated soil moisture is mostly validated by point-based measurements.\n\
    The surface SWC data derived from remote sensing are only validated by one or\
    \ several points’\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n20 of 29\ndata measured using techniques.\
    \ The scale differences can induce large errors in soil moisture retrieval\noutputs\
    \ and methods. So, a surface to surface or pixel to pixel validation method should\
    \ be developed\nto deal with this problem.\n6.4. Improvements to the Soil Moisture\
    \ Estimation Theory\nThe physical principles of many SM estimation methods include\
    \ energy balance equations that\nserve as boundary conditions. According to previous\
    \ studies, the energy balance is not always closed.\nThus, it is relatively easy\
    \ to induce uncertainties. Moreover, the SM is an important link in the water\n\
    cycle and the water balance for a speciﬁc region should be considered. In addition,\
    \ the laws and\ntheories regarding soil hydrothermal characteristic can be combined\
    \ with remotely sensed parameters\nto reveal the interaction mechanisms of soil\
    \ moisture. To accurately estimate the SM, the energy and\nwater balance should\
    \ be considered as well as the soil hydrothermal properties.\nTherefore, several\
    \ limitations exist in the current use of optical and thermal remote sensing SM\n\
    estimation methods. These methods are based on polar-orbiting earth observation\
    \ satellite advances,\nand polar-orbiting satellites usually obtain three or four\
    \ ground observations each day. Lacking data\nsources limits the development of\
    \ soil moisture retrieval methods. Fortunately, the geostationary\nmeteorological\
    \ satellites can achieve high frequency and continuous ground observations and\
    \ high\ntemporal resolution data that polar-orbiting satellites cannot do. Geostationary\
    \ meteorological satellites\ncan provide favorable conditions and opportunities\
    \ for estimating surface soil moisture [191–203].\nAcknowledgments: This paper\

    Abstract: The forthcoming two-satellite GMES Sentinel-1 constellation is expected
    to render systematic surface soil moisture retrieval at 1 km resolution using
    C-band SAR data possible for the first time from space. Owing to the constellation''s
    foreseen coverage over the Sentinel-1 Land Masses acquisition region-global approximately
    every six days, nearly daily over Europe and Canada depending on latitude-in the
    high spatial and radiometric resolution Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode,
    the Sentinel-1 mission shows high potential for global monitoring of surface soil
    moisture by means of fully automatic retrieval techniques. This paper presents
    the potential for providing such a service systematically over Land Masses and
    in near real time using a change detection approach, concluding that such a service
    is-subject to the mission operating as foreseen-expected to be technically feasible.
    The work presented in this paper was carried out as a feasibility study within
    the framework of the ESA-funded GMES Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Algorithm Development
    (S1-SMAD) project. Published in: IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction The Sentinel-1 mission is a part of the
    Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) program of the European
    Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission (EC) and is intended to provide
    continuous global all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging in support of GMES
    applications [1]. This paper presents the potential for a systematic global near-real-time
    (NRT) surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval service over the Sentinel-1 Land Masses
    acquisition region at 1 km resolution using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
    data acquired in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode by the forthcoming two-satellite
    Sentinel-1 constellation, by means of a change detection approach. This work was
    carried out as a feasibility study within the framework of the ESA-funded GMES
    Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Algorithm Development (S1-SMAD) project. Soil moisture
    is a key parameter in the global water, energy and carbon cycles [2], [3]. Accordingly,
    it is an important factor in a variety of Earth sciences, including hydrology,
    meteorology, climatology and agronomy. Studies dealing with coarse-resolution
    (25–50 km) soil moisture data have already shown the high potential of ingesting
    such products in support of, e.g., numerical weather prediction [4], climate monitoring
    [5] and flood forecasting [6], [7]. Products at 1 km resolution are expected to
    prove useful in still more applications, including monitoring of agricultural
    yield at field level, catchment-scale hydrologic process studies and irrigation
    management. Soil moisture can be measured accurately at point scale using in situ
    techniques [8], with new approaches such as smart sensor webs [9] potentially
    opening the door to capturing area-representative measurements in a more cost-effective
    manner. Moreover, international efforts to collect and harmonize soil moisture
    network data from around the world [10], [11] have greatly enhanced the availability
    and accessibility of in situ soil moisture measurements. Nevertheless, in situ
    measurements from sparse networks may not necessarily be representative of their
    respective surrounding areas, and funding for such networks has undergone cutbacks
    in many regions most adversely affected by changes in the availability of fresh
    water resources [12], [13]. Alternatively, soil moisture can be measured at a
    variety of spatial and temporal scales using remote sensing techniques [14], with
    microwave instruments operated at frequencies below the relaxation frequency of
    water molecules (9 GHz near 0°C and 17 GHz at 20°C) holding the greatest potential
    on account of the magnitude of the dielectric contrast between wet and dry soil
    at those frequencies. The magnitude of the soil’s dielectric constant ε , in turn,
    strongly influences the intensity of the radar backscattering coefficient σ 0
    , which is known to grow monotonically with increasing soil moisture content [15],
    [16]. In the last decade, soil moisture measurements derived from spaceborne microwave
    radiometers and scatterometers at coarse spatial scales (25–50 km), including
    MetOp ASCAT [17], AMSR-E [18]–[20], Windsat [21] and SMOS [22], have increasingly
    become available to the user community [23]. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS) satellite, which carries a radiometer operated at L-band, was launched
    in 2009 and is notably the first satellite specialized specifically for the retrieval
    of soil moisture. SMOS provides soil moisture data at a spatial resolution in
    the order of 35–50 km. At the present time, only active microwave instruments
    providing sub-antenna footprint resolution by means of range and Doppler discrimination
    [24] can provide measurements from space at finer spatial scales (resolutions
    of 10 km and finer). Examples include the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR)
    instrument onboard the Envisat platform [25] and the SAR instrument onboard the
    forthcoming Sentinel-1 satellite, both of which operate at C-band. Another example
    is the forthcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite [26], which carries
    a conically scanning microwave instrument operating at L-band and is expected
    to be launched in the 2014–2015 timeframe. Soil moisture retrieval using active
    microwave data is a challenge on account of the confounding influence of the geometric
    and dielectric properties of the Earth’s surface on the backscattered signal [27].
    An exact signal decomposition could in theory be obtained by solving Maxwell’s
    equations, with recent advances in computational electromagnetics allowing for
    finding numerical solutions to Maxwell’s equations even for three-dimensional
    problems [28]. Even so, signal inversion techniques will always require that simplifying
    assumptions be made, particularly if the soil moisture retrieval is to be carried
    out on a global scale. As the impact of simplifying assumptions on the ability
    of the retrieval model to correctly describe the physical measurement process
    is, in general, not adequately understood, it is not possible a priori to predict
    which soil moisture retrieval approach will perform best in the context of the
    Sentinel-1 mission. Once the mission is rendered operational, different retrieval
    approaches—e.g., analytical inversion of empirical models, iterative least squares
    matching using semi-empirical forward models, lookup tables, Bayesian approaches,
    possibilistic methods, or neural networks trained with theoretical models—ought
    to be evaluated in order to identify the most robust and accurate approach [29],
    [30]. In this paper, a change detection model developed and already extensively
    tested in a SAR context using the Global Monitoring (GM) mode of the ASAR instrument
    onboard the Envisat platform [31], [32] is adopted. Underlying change detection
    techniques is the assumption that the backscatter cross-section over soil surfaces
    across short time scales changes primarily on account of variations in soil moisture,
    while surface roughness and vegetation vary more slowly [33]. The TU Wien method
    is a change detection approach originally developed for the ERS scatterometer
    at a spatial resolution of 50 km [34]–[36], later adapted to MetOp ASCAT at 25
    km [17] and Envisat ASAR GM mode at 1 km [32], respectively. The method has been
    extensively validated using in situ measurements, modeled soil moisture data and
    other satellite-based retrievals, with retrieval accuracies approaching the accuracy
    goals of SMOS and SMAP; see, e.g., [37] for results obtained for the ERS scatterometer,
    [38] for ASCAT and [39] for ASAR GM mode. Even more recent validation studies
    using ASCAT and SMOS suggest that the ASCAT change detection approach gives retrievals
    comparable to—and in some regions even slightly better than—the SMOS Level 2 algorithm
    [40], [41]. The ASCAT Level 2 surface soil moisture product is distributed operationally
    by EUMETSAT in NRT, within 130 minutes of acquisition. The proposed NRT SSM retrieval
    algorithm for Sentinel-1 in IW mode is an adaptation of the TU Wien method most
    closely akin with the method’s earlier adaptation to Envisat ASAR GM mode [32].
    Among the ASAR modes, GM mode offers the best balance between radiometric, spatial
    and temporal resolution in support of change detection-driven SSM retrieval. With
    ASAR GM mode data at 1 km resolution provided at a radiometric resolution of 1.2
    dB, the quality of SSM retrieval is expected to benefit considerably from the
    foreseen radiometric resolution of Sentinel-1 IW mode, which is expected to be
    in the order of 0.05–0.07 dB when aggregated to a spatial resolution of 1 km.
    The temporal resolution of the Sentinel-1 constellation in IW mode over the Land
    Masses acquisition region—with an outlook to coverage every six days globally
    and nearly daily over Europe and Canada depending on latitude [42]—is, likewise,
    expected to contribute favorably to calibration of the TU Wien model, vis-à-vis
    what has been possible with data acquired in Envisat ASAR GM mode. User requirements
    for a systematic global NRT SSM retrieval service are reasonably well known, owing
    to the proliferation in availability of soil moisture products over the past decade.
    Requirements common to operational users are: (i) high temporal resolution, (ii)
    long-term availability of the SSM data, (iii) availability of SSM time series
    for user model calibration (at least one year), (iv) well-known spatio-temporal
    error characterization, and (v) free and easy access. In the following section,
    a review of attributes of the Sentinel-1 mission relevant to the retrieval of
    surface soil moisture is given, with Section III presenting the adaptation of
    the TU Wien method for Sentinel-1 accordingly. Section IV discusses the processing
    chain of the proposed NRT SSM retrieval software (S2M-NRT), as implemented within
    the framework of the S1-SMAD project, which runs on model parameters computed
    in non-NRT by the so-called reprocessing facility (S2M-RF). The processing chain
    of the proposed S2M-RF is taken up in Section V. In support of evaluating processor
    timeliness for delivery of SSM products in NRT, Section VI provides a runtime
    analysis of the S2M-NRT software demonstrator implemented within the framework
    of the S1-SMAD project on simulated Sentinel-1 input data. SECTION II. Sentinel-1
    The space segment of the GMES Sentinel-1 mission is expected to consist of at
    least two identical near-polar sun-synchronous orbiting satellites, each at a
    mean altitude of 693 km and equipped with a C-band SAR instrument operating at
    a center frequency of 5.405 GHz with support for HH-HV and VV-VH simultaneous
    co- and cross-polarization receive channels. The first of the satellite pair,
    Sentinel-1A, is expected to be launched in 2013, with the launch of its sister
    satellite Sentinel-1B foreseen 18 months thereafter. The two satellites are each
    designed for a nominal lifetime of 7 years, extendable to 12 [43]. A. Acquisition
    Strategy In support of interferometric applications, the reference orbit of both
    satellites is expected to be maintained within the same Earth-fixed orbital tube
    radius of 50 meter-rms for the duration of the mission’s nominal lifetime. In
    the aim of satisfying the constraints imposed by the mission’s observation requirements,
    overlap between data takes within an orbit cycle is minimized. Moreover, data
    takes are expected to match closely across cycles with respect to length, acquisition
    mode and relative ordering within the cycle—yielding predictable acquisition geometry
    and spatial coverage—unless acquisitions are made within the framework of the
    GMES Emergency Management Service (EMS) [43]. A total of four acquisition regions
    have been defined in the published Sentinel-1 Payload Data Ground Segment (PDGS)
    documentation, with each Sentinel-1 nominal imaging mode operated over a specific
    set of regions. These four acquisition regions are Arctic/Antarctic, Maritime
    Transport Zones (MTZs), Land Masses and Ocean [44]. The Sentinel-1 constellation
    is expected to cover Land Masses globally every six days, with nearly daily coverage
    foreseen over Europe and Canada [42]. B. Characteristic Local Incidence Angles
    A consequence of the stability of the acquisition strategy is the stability of
    the acquisition geometry across orbit cycles. Accordingly, it is expected—in stark
    contrast to, e.g., Envisat ASAR—that any single point on the Earth’s surface will
    be acquired at effectively one of a finite set of respective so-called characteristic
    local incidence angles. This number is expected to range from as few as one at
    the equator to as many as three at the poles. The set of characteristic local
    incidence angles associated with any point on the Earth’s surface can be determined,
    respectively, by means of orbit simulation once the starting point of the orbit
    is known. C. Systematic NRT Processing Over Land Masses In support of satisfying
    timeliness requirements, baseline Sentinel-1 NRT products are expected to be processed—in
    partially overlapping slices of configurable length—directly at the Core Ground
    Stations (CGSs) to which the corresponding raw data is downlinked. Such data is
    subject to an NRT-first downlink strategy, with maximum onboard data latency kept
    under one orbit. NRT products are expected to be made available within 3 hours
    of sensing in general, and within 1 hour if acquired within the visibility of
    a CGS. However, systematic processing in NRT within the framework of the Sentinel-1
    core PDGS at the CGSs is foreseen only over the Arctic/Antarctic, MTZs and Ocean
    acquisition regions. In contrast to baseline NRT products, baseline products with
    less stringent timeliness requirements—in particular those generated from data
    acquired over Land Masses—are expected to be processed at associated Processing
    and Archiving Centers (PACs), with an aim to keeping onboard data latency under
    two orbits [44]. Downlinked data from such data takes is expected to typically
    be split over different stations or over different passes. In general, it is not
    expected that it will be possible to process such downlinked partial data takes
    on an individual basis, since a partial data take might be too short or might
    fail to include internal calibration information [43]. Non-NRT baseline Level0
    products are accordingly expected to be processed over the entirety of their respective
    data takes, upon completion of an assembly stage. Baseline non-NRT products are
    expected to be made available within 24 hours of acquisition. The so-called collaborative
    PDGS of the Sentinel-1 mission is expected to provide a mechanism for augmenting
    the timeliness of the core PDGS—for instance by allowing systematic NRT processing
    over the Land Masses acquisition region—by adding appropriately equipped Local
    Ground Stations (LGSs) to the ground station network. Moreover, the collaborative
    PDGS is expected to allow for the integration of so-called hosted user processors,
    such as an implementation of the S2M-NRT. In support of processing and disseminating
    SSM products in NRT, the SSM retrieval processor would accordingly have to be
    run at the LGS level within the framework of the collaborative PDGS, alongside
    DEM geocoding and radiometric calibration in NRT of data acquired over Land Masses.
    Such geocoding and calibration of Level 0 products is not expected to impact NRT
    timeliness, since calibration and geocoding parameters can be known a priori in
    view of the foreseen stability of the mission’s acquisition geometry. D. Interferometric
    Wide Swath Mode Sentinel-1 SAR instrument data can be acquired in any one of four
    exclusive nominal imaging modes, namely in the low bit rate Wave (WV) mode or
    in the high bit rate StripMap (SM), Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) or Extra Wide
    Swath (EW) modes, respectively. The Land Masses acquisition region is expected
    to be acquired in IW mode by default, with the SM and EW modes available for emerging
    user requests and for continuity with the earlier ERS and Envisat missions. Level
    0 IW mode data is expected to be provided at a single-look spatial resolution
    of 5 × 20 m, acquired across an incidence angle range of 30–45 degrees and over
    a swath width of 250 km. Upon downlink, raw IW mode data is expected to be systematically
    processed in non-NRT—as part of the baseline—up to Level 1 multi-looked Ground
    Range Detected (GRD) products in Medium Resolution (MR) at 88 × 89 m and High
    Resolution (HR) at 20 × 22 m, respectively, by the core PDGS. Systematic generation
    in NRT of DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD products at 1 km resolution over the Land Masses
    acquisition region is foreseen as a potential hosted user product [43], within
    the framework of the collaborative PDGS. Aggregated to 1 km, the radiometric resolution
    of data acquired in IW mode is expected to lie in the order of 0.05–0.07 dB. E.
    Data Volumes and Archiving Taking into account only a single Sentinel-1 satellite,
    total data volumes for only Level 0 data across all acquisition regions are expected
    to reach ca. 320 TB per annum, amounting to ca. 2.3 PB (petabytes) in the course
    of 7.5 years [44]. Level 0 products are expected to contain the Flexible Dynamic
    Block Adaptive Quantization (FDBAQ)-compressed [45] raw instrument source packet
    data alongside annotations in support of subsequent calibration and post-processing.
    Availability of archived Level 0 products is foreseen for 25 years following the
    end of the space segment operations [43], with the most accurate version of the
    antenna pattern expected to be made available—in the form of annotation data—within
    two weeks of acquisition. Total Level 1 data volumes for baseline products are
    expected to be 4–5 times larger than those for Level 0. Accordingly, it is foreseen
    that within the framework of the core PDGS, Level 1 data will be generated on
    the fly as needed, rather than undergo systematic archiving. Again owing to the
    steady acquisition geometry, these sizable data volumes are not expected to impact
    NRT timeliness. SECTION III. The TU Wien Method for Sentinel-1 The TU Wien backscatter
    model expresses backscatter measurements σ 0 (θ,t) [dB], where θ [deg] and t are
    the local incidence angle (LIA) and time, respectively, at which the measurement
    was acquired, in terms of empirical model parameters and the degree of surface
    soil water saturation m s (t)∈[0,1] , which gives the volume of water present
    in the soil relative to the volume of the soil’s pores [46]. Adapting the TU Wien
    backscatter model—originally developed for the ERS scatterometer at 50 km [34]–[36]
    and later modified for MetOp ASCAT at 25 km [17]—to 1 km DEM-geocoded Envisat
    ASAR GM mode data, σ 0 (θ,t) is decomposed according to σ 0 (θ,t)= σ 0 dry (30)+β(θ−30)+S
    m s (t) (1) View Source where σ 0 dry (30) [dB] is the dry reference at a reference
    local incidence angle of 30°, S [dB] is the sensitivity of σ 0 to changes in surface
    soil moisture and β [dB/deg] is termed the slope [32]. The dry reference is assumed
    to correspond closely with the soil wilting point. The slope β —which accounts
    for the incidence angle dependency of backscatter measurements—is estimated from
    the slope of the line of best fit in a least squares sense to a long time series
    of DEM-geocoded backscatter measurements σ 0 in dB plotted as a function of local
    incidence angle θ , noting that this dependency is approximately linear in the
    incidence angle range of 20° to 40° of ASAR GM mode [32]. A backscatter measurement
    σ 0 (θ,t) is normalized to the reference angle of 30° according to σ 0 (30,t)=
    σ 0 (θ,t)−β(θ−30). (2) View Source By reorganizing the terms in (1) and plugging
    in (2), the degree of surface soil water saturation m s (t) is given by m s (t)=
    σ 0 (30,t)− σ 0 dry (30) S . (3) View Source The Sentinel-1 mission is expected
    to feature an acquisition strategy such that backscatter measurements for any
    point on the Earth’s surface be acquired at up to only three respective characteristic
    local incidence angles (up to three at high latitudes, as few as one along the
    equator), for acquisitions not made within the framework of the GMES Emergency
    Management Service (EMS) [43]. Accordingly, normalization as carried out in (2)
    is rendered neither possible in general nor necessary in practice. Let Θ( σ 0
    ) be the set of characteristic local incidence angles θ char available at the
    location corresponding to the backscatter measurement σ 0 (θ,t) . A local incidence
    angle θ at which a backscatter measurement σ 0 (θ,t) was acquired is defined to
    correspond to a characteristic local incidence angle θ char ∈Θ( σ 0 ) if θ char
    minimizes abs(θ− θ char ) over the available characteristic local incidence angles
    in Θ( σ 0 ) , subject to the condition that abs(θ− θ char )<T , for some tight
    angular threshold T . The proposed adaptation of the TU Wien backscatter model
    presented in (1) to the context of the Sentinel-1 mission is given by σ 0 (θ,t)=
    σ 0 dry ( θ char )+S m s (t) (4) View Source where θ is understood to correspond
    to θ char . Accordingly, surface soil water saturation m s (t) for Sentinel-1
    is retrieved according to m s (t)= σ 0 (θ,t)− σ 0 dry ( θ char ) S . (5) View
    Source The sensitivity S to changes in surface soil moisture is estimated by the
    observed dynamic range σ 0 wet ( θ char )− σ 0 dry ( θ char ) of the backscatter
    measurements at the location under consideration, where σ 0 wet ( θ char ) is
    the wet reference at θ char . Analogously to the dry reference, the wet reference
    is assumed to correspond closely with the soil saturation point. A. Model Parameter
    Retrieval The respective references with respect to characteristic local incidence
    angle θ char could be obtained and stored per gridpoint of a global grid at 1
    km resolution according to σ 0 wet ( θ char )= 1 N wet ∑ i=N− N wet N wet σ 0
    i ( θ char ) (6) View Source and σ 0 dry ( θ char )= 1 N dry ∑ i=1 N dry σ 0 i
    ( θ char ) (7) View Source where the N available measurements σ 0 i at the gridpoint
    under consideration are understood to be sorted in ascending order and N wet and
    N dry serve only to robustify the resulting references with respect to outliers.
    N wet and N dry are derived according to statistical methods akin to [32], i.e.,
    by taking into account the proportion of SSM measurements for which m s >0.95
    and m s <0.05 , respectively, obtained over recent years. Until an adequate number
    of 1 km Sentinel-1 IW mode GRD measurements are judged to be available, the references
    could be bootstrapped using Envisat ASAR GM mode Level 1b data at 1 km and subsequently
    normalized to the appropriate characteristic local incidence angles θ char , respectively.
    B. Retrieval Error Model The SSM retrieval error is determined by the noise of
    the Sentinel-1 SAR instrument in IW mode and the respective uncertainties of the
    model parameters. Denoting the noise of Sentinel-1 IW mode GRD σ 0 measurements
    by Δ σ 0 and the errors of the corresponding model parameters σ 0 dry and σ 0
    wet by Δ σ 0 dry and Δ σ 0 wet , respectively, the retrieval error Δ m s of m
    s can be estimated by means of Gaussian error propagation with respect to (5)
    according to Δ m 2 s ≈ ( Δ σ 0 S ) 2 + ( ( m s −1)Δ σ 0 dry S ) 2 + ( m s Δ σ
    0 wet S ) 2 (8) View Source where Δ σ 0 is set to 0.1 dB (rather than to the anticipated
    0.05–0.07 dB radiometric resolution of IW mode at 1 km) in order to render the
    model more conservative as a first estimate. Following the reasoning in [32],
    and assuming that the errors Δ σ 0 dry and Δ σ 0 wet are 5% of the observed dynamic
    range S of the backscatter measurements, i.e., Δ σ 0 dry =Δ σ 0 wet =0.05 S ,
    the maximum retrieval error Δ m s,max is given by Δ m s,max ≈ ( 0.1 S ) 2 +0.0025
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ . (9) View Source While for Sentinel-1 this error
    model may still be subject to refinement in the future, its adaptation to Envisat
    ASAR GM mode has already proven useful for predicting the root mean square error
    (RMSE) and correlation between SSM data derived from ASAR GM mode and soil moisture
    data simulated by hydrological models [47]. SECTION IV. NRT SSM Retrieval The
    processing chain of the proposed data-driven NRT SSM retrieval processor (S2M-NRT)
    is depicted in Fig. 1. Starting with a 1 minute DEM-geocoded GRD slice at 1 km
    resolution acquired in IW mode, the S2M-NRT processor identifies the requisite
    model parameters corresponding to the geocoded slice. These model parameters—pre-computed
    in non-NRT by the reprocessing facility—are stored at regularly spaced gridpoints
    and indexed by characteristic local incidence angle θ char . The S2M-NRT software
    demonstrator written within the framework of the S1-SMAD project stores those
    gridpoints in the form of a regular tiling of the plate carrée projection. Accordingly,
    once the requisite tiles have been identified, they are retrieved from the parameter
    database in which they are stored, the appropriate set of parameters they contain
    (according to respective corresponding characteristic local incidence angles)
    are mosaicked, and those mosaics are then resampled to the grid of the geocoded
    input slice. With input backscatter measurements σ 0 and corresponding wet and
    dry references, respectively, all in the same grid, surface soil water saturation
    m s (t) is finally computed per pixel of the input slice according to (5). Since
    extreme weather events can cause an input DEM-geocoded backscatter measurement
    σ 0 (θ,t) to lie outside the interval defined by its corresponding references,
    m s (t) is set to 0 if negative, or to 1 if greater than 1. Provided a soil porosity
    map at 1 km resolution is available, volumetric surface soil water saturation
    m v (t) can be estimated by multiplying m s (t) with soil porosity [48]. Fig.
    1. The part of the flow chart enclosed in the rounded rectangle supplies the DEM-geocoded
    IW mode GRD slices at 1 km resolution and associated local incidence angle (LIA)
    images required as input by the proposed S2M-NRT and is assumed to be implemented
    elsewhere in the Sentinel-1 (collaborative) PDGS. The remainder of the diagram
    depicts the data-driven processing chain of the proposed S2M-NRT, as implemented
    within the framework of the S1-SMAD project. Note that the S2M-NRT is accordingly
    parallelizable over input slices. Show All A. Quality Flag Image Not all land
    cover classes lend themselves to meaningful retrieval of surface soil moisture.
    In order to address this fact in the S2M-NRT software demonstrator implemented
    within the framework of the S1-SMAD project, a binary mask is provided alongside
    the SSM image output by the S2M-NRT, giving an indication of meaningfulness of
    each output m s (t) pixel. The choice of whether to use an output m s (t) value
    thus rests squarely with the user, regardless of the value of its corresponding
    quality flag. A pixel is masked out if it corresponds to any of the following
    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) [49] land
    cover classes: (i) Urban and Built up Land, (ii) Evergreen Broadleaf Forest, (iii)
    Water Bodies, (iv) Barren or Sparsely Vegetated, or (v)Snow or Ice. Class (iv)
    encompasses desert areas; in the case of class (ii), backscatter is dominated
    by volume scattering in forest canopy. Additionally, a pixel is masked out in
    the quality flag image if temporal correlation between DEM-geocoded σ 0 (θ,t)
    at 1 km and the same measurements aggregated to a coarser (regional) scale at
    25 km lies below a threshold. This last criterion is driven by the nature of across-scale
    interaction of soil moisture [50]. When m s is updated such that it lie within
    the interval defined by its references, the corresponding pixel is masked out
    in the quality flag image. B. Emergency Services In the event that backscatter
    measurements σ 0 (θ,t) be acquired within the framework of the GMES Emergency
    Management Service (EMS) [43], the respective local incidence angles θ might not
    correspond to any characteristic local incidence angle θ char available at the
    location in question. A database of slope parameters β obtained from a long time
    series of 1km DEM-geocoded Envisat ASAR GM mode data would provide an avenue for
    normalizing any such emergency backscatter measurement to the characteristic local
    incidence angle θ char ∈Θ( σ 0 ) that minimizes abs(θ− θ char ) , once again subject
    to abs(θ− θ char )<T , for some tight angular threshold T . The thus normalized
    input data could then be used for retrieval of surface soil water saturation m
    s (t) according to (5). SECTION V. Reprocessing Facility The purpose of the proposed
    non-NRT reprocessing facility (S2M-RF) is twofold. The S2M-RF is responsible primarily
    for computing revised wet and dry references (cf. Section III-A) using data made
    available since the last revision to the references. In support of providing user
    access to SSM data derived using the most accurate available antenna pattern calibration
    parameters, it also serves to compute revised S2M-NRT outputs (in non-NRT) for
    images that had already been computed in NRT since the last update to their calibration
    annotations, respectively. The proposed schedule-driven processing chain for the
    S2M-RF is depicted in Fig. 2; the same processing chain could in principle be
    invoked explicitly, e.g., in the event that changes be made to how wet and dry
    references are retrieved. Given a set of new 1 km DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD images,
    each image (and its associated local incidence angle image) is first resampled
    to the grid of the parameter database and stored as a time series. One way to
    store such time series is in the form of a tiling akin to that of the parameter
    database discussed in Section IV. In the case of inputs that had already been
    fed to the S2M-RF at an earlier point in time, but for which updated calibration
    annotations are made available, the original entries in the parameter database
    are identified and respectively adjusted to reflect the revised annotations. Once
    the historical time series database has been augmented with all new or revised
    1 km DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD input images, wet and dry references are computed
    per gridpoint and indexed according to respective characteristic local incidence
    angle. Note that measurements that do not correspond to any of a gridpoint’s characteristic
    local incidence angles are not taken under consideration by the S2M-RF for computing
    the references. Finally, the set of 1 km DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD input images
    are reprocessed in non-NRT by the S2M-NRT using the revised parameter database.
    Fig. 2. The part of the flow chart enclosed in the rounded rectangle supplies
    the input data required by the proposed S2M-RF, and is assumed to be implemented

    depicts the schedule-driven processing chain of the proposed S2M-RF. Show All
    Fig. 3. Simulated 1 minute DEM-geocoded Sentinel-1 IW mode GRD slice at 1 km resolution
    (ca. 408 km in the along track, 250 km in the across track) over central Europe,
    used as input to the S2M-NRT software demonstrator in support of evaluating the
    timeliness of the S2M-NRT. The simulated backscatter measurements were obtained
    from a global backscatter model. The simulated slice is provided in the plate
    carrée projection. Show All Such a schedule-driven update to the parameter database
    could—as a tentative estimate—be carried out once every two years. As revisions
    of the parameter database entail ingestion overhead for users, a balance ought
    to be struck between keeping model parameters up to date and mitigating such user
    overhead. SECTION VI. Timeliness Downlinked Sentinel-1 NRT data is expected to
    be processed in partially overlapping slices of configurable length. Given a foreseen
    Sentinel-1 ground speed of 6.8 km/s, a 1 minute slice acquired in IW mode corresponds
    to approximately 408 km in the along track and 250 km in the across track (the
    IW mode swath width), amounting to an area of ca. 102,000 km² (cf. Fig. 3). The
    mosaicking and resampling of model parameter tiles is what dominates the running
    time of the S2M-NRT software demonstrator, with the number of tiles covering a
    slice depending on the projection employed and the slice’s location on the Earth’s
    surface. In the plate carrée projection, a simulated 1minute DEM-geocoded IW mode
    GRD slice at 1 km resolution corresponds to a total of ca. 60 tiles at the equator
    and ca. 120 over Scandinavia. Fig. 4. The ground track—restricted to the Land
    Masses acquisition region—along which simulated 1 minute DEM-geocoded IW mode
    GRD slices at 1 km resolution were generated in support of evaluating the timeliness
    of the S2M-NRT. Show All The S2M-NRT software demonstrator implemented within
    the framework of the S1-SMAD project was written in IDL and tested under Windows
    on a 3.07 GHz 8-core PC. Simulated 1minute DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD slices at
    1 km resolution and corresponding wet and dry references were pre-computed over
    the Land Masses acquisition region for half an orbit (cf. Fig. 4), by leveraging
    version 4.2 of ESA’s Earth Observation CFI orbit simulation software [51] and
    a global backscatter model [52]. For each simulated slice, the S2M-NRT software
    demonstrator output an SSM image, a retrieval error estimate image and a quality
    flag image, respectively, in under 2 seconds. SECTION VII. Conclusion The radiometric,
    spatial and temporal resolutions at which Sentinel-1 IW mode C-band SAR data is
    expected to be acquired render the Sentinel-1 mission a promising platform for
    systematic surface soil moisture retrieval at 1 km over the mission’s Land Masses
    acquisition region, exceeding the possibilities for retrieval using SAR data acquired
    by the earlier Envisat mission. The software demonstrator that implements the
    change detection-driven surface soil moisture retrieval algorithm presented in
    this paper was shown to support even the most stringent variety of NRT timeliness
    defined within the context of the Sentinel-1 mission. Retrieval in NRT with respect
    to time of acquisition—subject to the mission operating as foreseen—is expected
    to be technically feasible within the framework of the hosted user environment
    of the mission’s payload data ground segment. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work carried
    out in this paper within the framework of the S1-SMAD project builds upon earlier

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices
    (e.g., conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar applications) have been
    widely adopted to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity. However, current measurements
    regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge
    widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined
    CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential
    of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis
    of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects
    of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental
    controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented
    the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover
    crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the
    effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively
    warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated
    that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink.
    We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g.,
    climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices)
    in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
    while ensuring crop productivity. 1 INTRODUCTION Soil organic carbon (SOC) is
    a primary indicator of soil health and plays a critical role in food production,
    greenhouse gas balance, and climate change mitigation and adaptation (Lorenz &
    Lal, 2016). The dynamic of agricultural SOC is regulated by the balance between
    carbon inputs (e.g., crop residues and organic fertilizers) and outputs (e.g.,
    decomposition and erosion) under long-term constant environment and management
    conditions. However, this balance has been dramatically altered by climate change,
    which is expected to enhance SOC decomposition and weaken the capacity of soil
    to sequester carbon (Wiesmeier et al., 2016). Generally, agricultural soils contain
    considerably less SOC than soils under natural vegetation due to land conversion
    and cultivation (Hassink, 1997; Poeplau & Don, 2015), with a potential to sequester
    carbon from the atmosphere through proper management practices (Lal, 2018). Therefore,
    it is crucial to seek practical approaches to enhance agricultural SOC sequestration
    without compromising the provision of ecosystem services such as food, fiber,
    or other agricultural products. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has been promoted
    as a systematic approach for developing agricultural strategies to ensure sustainable
    food security in the context of climate change (FAO, 2013). One of the major objectives
    of CSA is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance soil carbon sequestration
    and soil health (Campbell, Thornton, Zougmoré, Asten, & Lipper, 2014; Lipper et
    al., 2014). The key for sequestering more carbon in soils lies in increasing carbon
    inputs and reducing carbon outputs. Frequently recommended approaches for SOC
    sequestration include adding cover crops into the crop rotation, applying biochar
    to soils, and minimizing soil tillage (i.e., conservation tillage). In recent
    decades, these management practices have been applied in major agricultural regions
    globally, and a large number of observations/measurements have been accumulated
    (e.g., Chen, Marhan, Billen, & Stahr, 2009; Clark et al., 2017; Spokas, Koskinen,
    Baker, & Reicosky, 2009). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
    positive effects of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration. For example,
    conservation tillage reduces soil disturbance and the soil organic matter decomposition
    rate (Salinas-Garcia, Hons, & Matocha, 1997) and promotes fungal and earthworm
    biomass (Lavelle, Brussaard, & Hendrix, 1999; Briones & Schmidt, 2017), thereby
    improving SOC stabilization (Liang & Balser, 2012). Cover crops provide additional
    biomass inputs from above- and belowground (Blanco-Canqui, Mikha, Presley, & Claassen,
    2011), increase carbon and nitrogen inputs, and enhance the biodiversity of agroecosystems
    (Lal, 2004). Moreover, cover crops can promote soil aggregation and structure
    (Sainju, Whitehead, & Singh, 2003), therefore indirectly reduce carbon loss from
    soil erosion (De Baets, Poesen, Meersmans, & Serlet, 2011). Biochar amendments
    affect SOC dynamics through two pathways: (a) improving soil aggregation and physical
    protection of aggregate-associated SOC against microbial attack; and (b) increasing
    the pool of recalcitrant organic substrates resulting in a low SOC decomposition
    rate and substantial negative priming (Du, Zhao, Wang, & Zhang, 2017; Weng et
    al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2012). Although these CSA management practices have been
    widely used to enhance soil health (e.g., Denef, Zotarelli, Boddey, & Six, 2007;
    Fungo et al., 2017; Thomsen & Christensen, 2004; Weng et al., 2017), their effects
    on SOC sequestration are variable and highly dependent on experiment designs and
    site-specific conditions such as climate and soil properties (Abdalla, Chivenge,
    Ciais, & Chaplot, 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Paustian et al., 2016; Poeplau & Don,
    2015). The potential to sequester soil carbon varies greatly among CSA practices,
    which has not been well addressed. Some studies even suggested negative effects
    of CSA management practices on SOC (e.g., Liang, Zhang, Fang, Yang, & Drury, 2007;
    Tian, Kang, Kolawole, Idinoba, & Salako, 2005). Also, most prior quantitative
    research focused on the effects of a single CSA practice on SOC (e.g., Abdalla
    et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Poeplau & Don, 2015), very few studies estimated
    the combined effects of diverse CSA and conventional management practices. Some
    recent studies reported that a combination of cover crops and conservation tillage
    could significantly increase SOC compared to a single management practice (Ashworth,
    Allen, Wight, Saxton, & Tyler, 2014; Blanco-Canqui, Holman, Schlegel, Tatarko,
    & Shaver, 2013; Duval, Galantini, Capurro, & Martinez, 2016; Higashi et al., 2014).
    For example, Sainju, Singh, Whitehead, and Wang (2006) suggested that soil carbon
    sequestration may increase 0.267 Mg C ha−1 year−1 under a combination of no-till
    and cover crop practices, where the latter was a mixed culture of hairy vetch
    (Vicia villosa) and rye (Secale cereale); in contrast, a carbon loss of 0.967
    Mg C ha−1 year−1 occurred when only no-till was used. Agegnehu, Bass, Nelson,
    and Bird (2016) reported that 1.58% and 0.25% more SOC were sequestered in the
    mid-season and end-season, respectively, under conservation tillage when biochar
    was also applied. These findings highlight the importance of quantitatively evaluating
    the combined effects of multiple CSA management practices (including the combination
    of CSA and conventional management practices) on SOC sequestration under different
    climate and soil conditions. This study aims to fill the abovementioned knowledge
    gap through a meta-analysis to simultaneously examine the effects of three widely
    used CSA management practices (i.e., conservation tillage [no-till, NT; and reduced
    tillage, RT], cover crops, and biochar) on SOC sequestration (Figure 1). Our scientific
    objectives were to: (a) evaluate and compare the effects of conservation tillage,
    cover crops, and biochar use on SOC; (b) examine how environmental factors (e.g.,
    soil properties and climate) and other agronomic practices (e.g., nitrogen fertilization,
    residue management, irrigation, and crop rotation) influence SOC in these CSA
    management environments. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationship

    data from 417 peer-reviewed articles (297 for conservation tillage, 64 for cover
    crops, and 56 for biochar) published from 1990 to May 2017 (Data S1). Among all
    publications, 113 for conservation tillage, 32 for cover crops, and 7 for biochar
    were conducted in the Unites States. All articles were identified from the Web
    of Science. The search keywords were “soil organic carbon” and “tillage” for conservation
    tillage treatments; “soil organic carbon” and “cover crop” for cover crop treatments;
    and “soil organic carbon” and “biochar” for biochar treatments. All selected studies
    meet the following inclusion criteria: (a) SOC was measured in field experiments
    (to estimate the potential of biochar to increase soil carbon, we also included
    soil incubation and pot experiments with regard to biochar use); (b) observations
    were conducted on croplands excluding orchards and pastures; (c) ancillary information
    was provided, such as experiment duration, replication, and sampling depth; and
    (d) other agronomic management practices were included besides the three target
    management practices in this study. We considered conventional tillage as the
    control for NT and RT. Experiments that eliminated any tillage operation were
    grouped into the NT category, and experiments using tillage with lower frequency
    or shallower till-depth or less soil disturbance in comparison to the paired conventional
    tillage (e.g., moldboard plow and chisel plow) were grouped into the RT category.
    Likewise, “no cover crop” and “no biochar” were treated as control experiments
    relative to cover crop and biochar treatments, respectively. We only considered
    studies that viewed cover crops as treatments and fallow (or weeds) as controls.
    SOC data were either derived from tables or extracted from figures using the GetData
    Graph Digitizer software v2.26 (http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/download.php).
    Other related information from the selected studies was also recorded, including
    location (i.e., longitude and latitude), experiment duration, climate (mean annual
    air temperature and precipitation), soil properties (texture, depth, and pH),
    and other agronomic practices (crop residues, nitrogen fertilization, irrigation,
    and crop rotation). The study durations were grouped into three categories: short
    term (≤5 years), medium term (6–20 years), and long term (>20 years). Climate
    was grouped according to the aridity index published by UNEP (1997) as either
    arid (≤0.65) or humid (>0.65). Study sites were grouped into cool (temperate and
    Mediterranean climates) and warm zones (semitropical and tropical climates; Shi,
    Luo, Fan, & Ping, 2010). Soil texture was grouped as silt loam, sandy loam, clay
    and clay loam, loam, silty clay and silty clay loam, and loamy sand according
    to the USDA soil texture triangle. Soil depth was grouped as 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm,
    20–50 cm, and 50–100 cm. Soil pH was grouped as acidic (<6.6), neutral (6.6–7.3),
    and alkaline (>7.3). Crop residue management was grouped as “residue returned”
    and “residue removed.” We only included those studies that used the same residue
    management in the control and treatment groups. Similarly, nitrogen fertilization
    was grouped into no addition, low (1–100 kg N/ha), medium (101–200), and high
    levels (>200). Irrigation management was grouped as irrigated or rainfed. Crop
    sequence was grouped as rotational or continuous crops (including crop-fallow
    systems). We also estimated the response of SOC in the whole-soil profiles (from
    the soil surface to 120 cm, with an interval of 10 cm) to CSA management practices.
    The standard deviation (SD) of selected variables, an important input variable
    to the meta-analysis, was computed as SD = SE × , where SE is the standard error
    and n is the number of observational replications. If the results of a study were
    reported without SD or SE, SD was calculated based on the average coefficient
    of variation for the known data. Publication bias was analyzed by the method of
    fail-safe number, which suggests that the meta-analysis can be considered robust
    if the fail-safe number is larger than 5 × k + 10 (where k is the number of observed
    studies; Rothstein, Sutton, & Borenstein, 2005). 2.2 Meta-analysis A random-effect
    model of meta-analysis was used to explore environmental and management variables
    that might explain the response of SOC to CSA management practices. The data analysis
    was performed in R (R Development Core Team, 2009). The response ratio (RR) was
    defined as the ratio between the outcome of CSA management practices and that
    of the control group. The logarithm of RR () was calculated as the effect size
    of each observation (Hedges, Gurevitch, & Curtis, 1999, Equation (1)): (1) where
    and are SOC values in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The variance
    (ν) of was computed as: (2) where and are the standard deviations of the treatment
    and control groups, respectively, while and are the sample sizes of the treatment
    and control groups, respectively. The weighting factor (), as the inverse of the
    variance, was computed for each observation to obtain a final weighting factor
    (), which was then used to calculate the mean effect size (RR++). The equations
    were: (3) (4) (5) where  =  is the weighted effect size, n is the total number
    of observations per study, and is the th observation. The 95% confidence intervals
    (CI) of were computed to determine statistical significance. The comparison between
    treatment and control was considered significant if the 95% CIs did not overlap
    zero (vertical lines in the graphs). The percent change was transformed −1) ×
    100%] to explain the response of the estimated CSA management practices. 3 RESULTS
    3.1 SOC responses to conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar Biochar applications
    enhanced SOC storage by 39% (28% in the field and 57% in incubation and pot experiments,
    Figure S1), representing the most effective practice, followed by cover crops
    (6%) and conservation tillage (5%; Figure 2). Cover crop species had a pronounced
    positive effect on SOC sequestration (Figure S1), ranging from 4% for nonleguminous
    cover crops to 9% for leguminous cover crops. When investigating different types
    of conservation tillage, NT and RT had similar effects on SOC (approximately 8%
    increase). All results were statistically significant (Figure 2). Theoretically,
    the combination of CSA management practices may result in greater or lesser effects
    on soil sequestration compared to single CSA management practice. However, if
    synergistic effects were the prevalent interactions, this combination might potentially
    enhance carbon accumulation (e.g., over 50% increase in SOC), which is subject
    to further investigation in field experiments. Across the whole dataset we compiled,
    the SOC varied widely in each CSA treatment (Figure S2). We calculated the distribution
    of the data points (the ratio of SOC of each treatment to that of the corresponding
    control, i.e., NT/RT vs. conventional tillage, cover crops vs. no cover crop,
    and biochar use vs. non-biochar; Figure S2). Most of the studies used in this
    meta-analysis reported positive responses of SOC to NT, RT, cover crops, and biochar
    treatment (60%, 65%, 68%, and 91%, respectively). The SOC change rates were 0.38
    ± 0.71 Mg ha−1 year−1 (n = 56) and −0.29 ± 0.79 Mg ha−1 year−1 (n = 30) in NT
    and RT systems, respectively (Figure S3). We did not calculate SOC sequestration
    rates for other treatments (i.e., cover crops and biochar) due to the lack of
    some ancillary information (e.g., bulk density). Figure 2 Open in figure viewer

    entire dataset. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of observations. Error
    bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till; RT, reduced tillage; SOC,
    soil organic carbon 3.2 Effects of CSA management practices in different climate
    zones Overall, CSA management practices sequestered more SOC in arid areas than
    in humid areas (Figure 3a). Biochar and cover crops increased 12% (38% vs. 26%)
    and 3% (9% vs. 6%) more SOC in arid areas, respectively, compared to humid areas.
    In comparison, the NT-induced SOC uptake was slightly higher in arid areas than
    that in humid areas (9% and 8%, respectively). However, the RT-induced SOC increment
    in arid areas was two times greater than that in humid areas. Our further analysis
    suggested that CSA management practices significantly increased SOC in both cool
    and warm climate zones with diverse responses (Figure 3b). For example, in warm
    areas, biochar applications only increased SOC by half of the enhancement observed
    in cool areas. Cover crops increased SOC by 15% in warm areas, three times larger
    than that in cool areas. In warm areas, NT increased SOC by 15% compared to 8%
    in cool areas. Reduced tillage increased SOC by 7% and 6% in warm and cool areas,
    respectively. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart
    management versus their controls for subcategories of climate zone (a: the climate
    zones were divided by aridity index; b: the climate zones were divided by mean

    Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till; RT, reduced tillage;
    SOC, soil organic carbon 3.3 Effects of CSA management practices with different
    soil properties The effects of CSA management practices on SOC were strongly influenced
    by soil texture (Figure 4). Biochar applications increased SOC by 63%, 62%, and
    52% in silty clay and silty clay loam soils, loam soils, and loamy sand soils,
    respectively. While relatively lower soil carbon uptakes under biochar applications
    were found in clay loam and clay soils (32%), silt loam soils (35%), and sandy
    loam soils (34%). Cover crops increased SOC by 4%, 6%, 7%, and 6% in clay loam
    and clay soils, silt loam soils, loam soils, and sandy loam soils, respectively.
    No-till increased SOC by 16% in silty clay and silty clay loam soils, compared
    to 12% in sandy loam soils and 7% in loamy sand soils. Reduced tillage increased
    SOC by 21%, 7%, and 15% in silty clay and silty clay loam soils, loam soils, and
    loamy sand soils, respectively. Overall, cover crops sequestered more carbon in
    coarse-textured soils than in fine-textured soils. In contrast, NT and RT increased
    SOC more in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils. No obvious relationship
    was found between biochar use and soil textures. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart management versus their controls for subcategories
    of soil textures. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of observations.
    Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till; RT, reduced tillage;
    SOC, soil organic carbon The positive effects of CSA management practices on SOC
    decreased with soil depth (Figure 5). Biochar significantly increased SOC by 41%
    and 14% in the 0–10 cm and 0–30 cm soil layers, respectively (Table S1). Cover
    crops significantly increased SOC by 9%, 3%, and 9% in the 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm,
    and 20–50 cm depth ranges, respectively. Further analysis showed that cover crops
    could increase SOC (5%) in the entire 0–70 cm soil profile (Table S1). Both NT
    and RT could significantly increase SOC most at 0–10 cm depth (22% and 17%, respectively).
    Although reduced SOC was observed in the 10–20 cm and 20–50 cm soil layers (−4%
    and −10%, respectively), NT could still enhance SOC sequestration in the entire
    soil profile up to 120 cm (Table S1). In comparison, RT could increase SOC in
    the 0–70 cm soil profile (Table S1) although decreased soil carbon (not statistically
    significant) was observed in the 10–50 cm soil layer (Figure 5). Figure 5 Open

    RT, reduced tillage; SOC, soil organic carbon. The average depths of each categorical
    group were presented in supplementary files (Tables S4–S7) All CSA management
    practices except RT positively influenced the SOC pool regardless of soil pH.
    The management-induced SOC uptake was generally higher in alkaline soils than
    in acid soils (Figure 6). Biochar use increased SOC by 65%, 35%, and 28% in alkaline,
    neutral, and acid soils, respectively. Cover crops increased SOC by 15% in neutral
    soils, followed by alkaline (9%) and acid soils (6%). No-till increased SOC by
    6% in acid soils and 13% in alkaline soils. The SOC increased by RT was greater
    in alkaline soils (9%) than in acid soils (6%), but RT had no significant influence
    on SOC in neutral soils. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison

    carbon 3.4 Combined effects of experiment duration and other agronomic practices
    The CSA management practices are generally applied together with other agronomic
    practices such as residue return, nitrogen fertilizer use, and irrigation. These
    agronomic practices may interact with the CSA management practices with positive
    or negative effects on the capacity of soils to sequester carbon. In this study,
    we considered experiment duration and four other agronomic practices, including
    residue return, nitrogen fertilization, irrigation, and crop sequence, to quantify
    these effects. Our results demonstrated that the influences of three CSA management
    practices on SOC varied with experiment duration. Biochar amendments significantly
    increased SOC by 45% and 36% in short-term and medium-term experiments, respectively.
    Cover crops significantly increased SOC by 5%, 11%, and 20% in the short-term,
    medium-term, and long-term experiments, respectively (Figure 7). No-till significantly
    increased SOC by 13% in the long-term experiments, followed by medium-term (7%)
    and short-term experiments (6%). Reduced tillage increased SOC by 12% in long-term
    studies, followed by medium-term (9%) and short-term experiments (3%). The average
    durations differed in each group (Table S2), which may influence the effect of
    CSA management practices on SOC. When excluding short and medium experiment durations
    (≤20 years) and shallow sampling (<20 cm), RT significantly increased SOC by 14%,
    while NT had no significant effect on SOC (Figure S4). Figure 7 Open in figure

    alter the magnitude of soil carbon uptake induced by CSA management practices.
    Biochar boosted SOC the most among CSA management practices regardless of nitrogen
    fertilizer levels, with the strongest effects under the low-level nitrogen inputs,
    followed by the high-level (38%), medium-level (29%), and no nitrogen fertilizer
    use (27%; Figure 9). Cover crops increased SOC by 6% under both low-level and
    medium-level nitrogen inputs, slightly higher than that under the high-level nitrogen
    fertilizer use (3%). No-till tended to sequester more soil carbon when nitrogen
    fertilizer input was relatively lower (11%, 8%, and 6% for low-level, medium-level,
    and high-level nitrogen fertilization, respectively). While RT increased SOC by
    13% at the medium-level nitrogen fertilizer rate, approximately two times larger
    than those under the low-level and high-level nitrogen fertilizer use (Figure
    9). Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart management

    results suggested that biochar markedly stimulated SOC increases in irrigated
    croplands (49%), three times higher than those under rainfed condition. Similarly,
    NT increased SOC by 15% in irrigated croplands, twice as much soil carbon as that
    in rainfed croplands. Cover crops increased SOC by 7% and 4% in irrigated and
    rainfed croplands, respectively. In contrast, the RT-induced SOC increase was
    16% under the rainfed condition, 5% higher than that in irrigated croplands (Figure
    10a). Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart management

    carbon The CSA management practices significantly promoted SOC uptakes in both
    rotational and continuous cropping systems (Figure 10b). Specifically, biochar
    amendments enhanced SOC by 52% in rotational cropping systems, much higher than
    that in the continuous cropping system (31%). While SOC uptakes induced by NT
    and RT showed no obvious differences in the rotational and continuous cropping
    systems (9% and 8% vs. 8% and 7%). Cover crops increased SOC by 4% in rotational
    cropping systems, lower than that in continuous cropping systems (8%). 3.5 Combinations
    of CSA management practices Our results demonstrated that combining different
    CSA management practices might significantly enhance SOC sequestration. In warm
    regions, SOC increased by 13% with the combination of conservation tillage and
    cover crops (Figure 11). In loamy sand and sandy clay loam soils, associated SOC
    uptakes increased to 31% and 21%, respectively. A similar effect was also observed
    in medium-term experiments. However, in clay soils, the combination of cover crops
    and conservation tillage significantly decreased SOC by 19%. Figure 11 Open in

    4.1 Effects of CSA management practices on SOC Common approaches for enhancing
    SOC focus on increasing carbon inputs, decreasing losses, or simultaneously affecting
    both inputs and losses. All CSA management practices discussed here, that is,
    biochar, cover crops, and conservation tillage, increase soil carbon sequestration
    to different extents. For example, SOC enhancement by biochar applications can
    reach up to 40% (Liu et al., 2016), while conservation tillage and cover crops
    increase SOC by only 3%–10% (Abdalla et al., 2016; Du, Angers, Ren, Zhang, & Li,
    2017; Luo, Wang, & Sun, 2010; Zhao et al., 2017) and ~10% (Aguilera, Lassaletta,
    Gattinger, & Gimeno, 2013), respectively. Our results agree with these earlier
    findings: biochar use increased SOC by 39%, followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation
    tillage (5%). The discrepancies among various CSA management practices in enhancing
    SOC fundamentally lie in their functional mechanisms. Biochar addition, with a
    low turnover rate, contributes directly to soil carbon storage and indirectly
    decreases native SOC decomposition rates by negative priming (Wang, Xiong, & Kuzyakov,
    2016). Cover crops are green manure that increases carbon inputs to the soil and
    subsequent SOC (Poeplau & Don, 2015). Conservation tillage practices may not necessarily
    add carbon; their contribution is primarily accomplished by protecting SOC from
    decomposition and erosion (Lal, 2005; Six, Elliott, & Paustian, 2000). Additionally,
    all three CSA management practices can potentially improve soil properties, thereby
    stimulating more carbon inputs from residue return and rhizodeposition due to
    promoted plant growth, and reducing carbon losses via decreasing leaching and
    erosion. However, the effectiveness of these practices on SOC sequestration and
    the mechanisms involved vary with environmental factors and other agronomic practices.
    4.2 Environmental control in CSA management practices Environmental factors such
    as climate and soil properties may influence carbon inputs to the soil and affect
    the processes that regulate carbon loss, considering that all CSA practices are
    implemented in site-specific climate and soil conditions. The effects of CSA management
    practices on SOC could be biased by environmental factors. 4.2.1 Climate variability
    Climate is one of the major driving forces that regulate SOC distribution. On
    average, SOC accumulation is greater than decomposition in wet areas than in dry
    and warm regions (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000). Soil carbon is positively related
    to precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature (Rusco, Jones, & Bidoglio,
    2001), with the former correlation tending to be stronger (Martin, Wattenbach,
    Smith, & Meersmans, 2011; Meersmans et al., 2011). High precipitation is usually
    associated with abundant growth and high rates of carbon inputs to soils (Luo,
    Feng, Luo, Baldock, & Wang, 2017), while low temperatures may remarkably reduce
    microbial activity, resulting in low rates of organic matter decomposition and
    measurable amounts of SOC accumulation (Castro, Steudler, Melillo, Aber, & Bowden,
    1995; Garcia, Nannipieri, & Hernandez, 2018). Biochar applications result in greater
    SOC accumulation in arid/cool areas than in humid/warm environments (Figure 3),
    probably due to the porous structure and the capacity of biochar to promote greater
    soil water retention (Abel et al., 2013; Karhu, Mattila, Bergström, & Regina,
    2011). It is not clear why biochar has a greater impact on SOC accrual in cool
    regions. A possible explanation is that high soil temperatures may promote biochar
    decomposition and oxidation (Cheng, Lehmann, Thies, & Burton, 2008). Cover crops
    and NT increased SOC with no significant difference between aridity conditions
    (Table 1), although they performed better at storing SOC in arid areas (Figure
    3a). This result suggests that arid-region soils have a high potential to store
    carbon when using proper management practices (Tondoh et al., 2016). In addition,
    cover crops and NT can enhance carbon sequestration more in warm areas than in
    cool areas. Temperature could affect the establishment and growth of cover crops
    (Akemo, Regnier, & Bennett, 2000). In warm areas, cover crops may develop well
    and potentially capture more carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, thus providing
    more carbon inputs into soils after they die (e.g., Bayer, Dieckow, Amado, Eltz,
    & Vieira, 2009). Table 1. Between-group variability (QM) of the variables controlling

    results in the breakdown of macroaggregates and the release of aggregate-protected
    SOC (Mikha & Rice, 2004; Six et al., 2000). Tillage-induced SOC decomposition
    usually proceeds at higher rates in warm than in cool areas. Implementing NT,
    with minimal soil disturbance, protects SOC from decomposition. As a result, SOC
    increases can be more significant in warm conditions considering the relatively
    higher baseline of the decomposition rate compared to that in cool areas. 4.2.2
    Soil properties Soil organic carbon is strongly correlated with clay content,
    with an increasing trend toward more SOC in fine-textured soils (Meersmans et
    al., 2012; Stronkhorst & Venter, 2008). The SOC mineralization rate probably diminishes
    as clay concentrations increase (Sainju, Singh, & Whitehead, 2002). Clay minerals
    can stabilize SOC against microbial attack through absorption of organic molecules
    (Ladd, Foster, Nannipieri, & Oades, 1996). By binding organic matter, clay particles
    help form and stabilize soil aggregates, imposing a physical barrier between decomposer
    microflora and organic substrates and limiting water and oxygen available for
    decomposition (Dominy, Haynes, & Antwerpen, 2002). Biochar use and cover crops
    promote carbon sequestration for all soil texture types. Such an enhancement of
    SOC does not vary significantly with soil texture (Table 1). The ability of conservation
    tillage to enhance SOC, however, differs with soil texture (Figure 4). Conservation
    tillage merely reduces soil disturbance and normally does not add extra materials
    to soils. It can be inferred that the effect of conservation tillage on SOC is
    more texture dependent than the other two management practices. Biochar is a carbon-rich
    material with a charged surface, organic functional groups, and a porous structure,
    which can potentially increase soil aggregation and cation exchange capacity (Jien
    & Wang, 2013). Similarly, cover crops directly provide carbon inputs to soils,
    and their root development and rhizodeposition can also benefit soil structure.
    These benefits are embedded in the source of biochar and cover crops per se. Thus,
    the effectiveness of biochar and cover crops in increasing SOC may depend on their
    properties other than soil texture. Soil depth may potentially influence the effects
    of the CSA practices on SOC (Baker, Ochsner, Venterea, & Griffis, 2007). The CSA
    practices were most beneficial to SOC accumulation in surface soils. For example,
    NT increased SOC by 7% in the 0–3 cm soil layer (Abdalla et al., 2016) and by
    3% at the 40 cm depth (Luo et al., 2010). Our findings suggested that CSA practices
    can enhance SOC sequestration in the entire soil profile, although the positive
    effects vary with soil depths (Table S1). Conventional tillage breaks soil aggregates
    and increases aeration and thus enhances soil organic matter mineralization (Cambardella
    & Elliott, 1993). Conventional tillage also incorporates residues into deeper
    soil layers, resulting in a more uniform distribution of SOC (albeit at lower
    concentrations) in the soil profile (Plaza-Bonilla, Cantero-Martinez, & Alvaro-Fuentes,
    2010; Sainju et al., 2006). In contrast, conservation tillage keeps residues at
    the soil surface and reduces their degree of incorporation into soil (Franzluebbers,
    Hons, & Zuberer, 1995). Nevertheless, positive effects of NT on SOC have been
    found in a deep soil profile (0–60 cm, Liu et al., 2014). As noted, in the 10–50
    cm soil layer, the effect of cover crops on SOC was found to be the greatest among
    all the CSA management practices we discussed (Figure 5). This is perhaps because
    much of the crop and cover crop root growth occurs in the surface soil (e.g.,
    Box & Ramsuer, 1993; Sainju, Singh, & Whitehead, 1998) and the generally greater
    contribution of roots to SOC than aboveground biomass (Allmaras, Linden, & Clapp,
    2004; Balesdent & Balabane, 1996). Soil pH is recognized as a dominant factor
    governing the soil organic matter turnover rate, although its mode of impact is
    still unclear (Van Bergen, Nott, Bull, Poulton, & Evershed, 1998). Soil pH affects
    selective presentation or metabolic modification of specific components (e.g.,
    lignin-cellulose, lipids) during decomposition (Kemmitt, Wright, Goulding, & Jones,
    2006) and therefore abiotic factors (e.g., carbon and nutrient availability) and
    biotic factors (e.g., the composition of the microbial community). Also, soil
    pH can change the decomposition rate of crop residues and SOC via its effect on
    SOC solubility and indirectly by altering microbial growth, activity, and community
    structure (Pietri & Brookes, 2009; Wang, Butterly, Baldock, & Tang, 2017). The
    levels of soluble organic carbon may increase with increasing acidity (Kemmitt
    et al., 2006; Willett, Reynolds, Stevens, Ormerod, & Jones, 2004). Motavalli,
    Palm, Parton, Elliott, and Frey (1995) suggested that increased soil acidity would
    cause greater soil organic matter accumulation due to reduced microbial mineralization;
    however, this was challenged by Kemmitt et al. (2006) who found no significant
    trend in SOC in response to pH changes. In this study, most CSA management practices
    resulted in greater increases in SOC in neutral or alkaline soils compared to
    acid soils. 4.3 CSA and other agronomic practices Crop residues provide substantial
    amounts of organic matter and may influence the effect of CSA practices on SOC.
    Residue retention changes the formation of soil macroaggregates (Benbi & Senapati,
    2010), promoting SOC preservation and accumulation (Six, Conant, Paul, & Paustian,
    2002). Residue cover protects the soil surface from direct impact by raindrops
    (Blanco-Canqui, Ferguson, Shapiro, Drijber, & Walters, 2014). In addition, crop
    residues provide organic substrates to soil microorganisms that can produce binding
    agents and promote soil aggregation (Guggenberger, Frey, Six, Paustian, & Elliott,
    1999). Conversely, residue removal reduces carbon input to the soil system and
    ultimately decreases SOC storage (Koga & Tsuji, 2009; Manna et al., 2005). This
    suggests that the amount of carbon inputs predominantly controls changes in SOC
    stocks (Virto, Barré, Burlot, & Chenu, 2012). For the conditions of cover crops
    and NT, enhancing SOC was significantly greater with residue return than with
    residue removal. Our study suggests that changes in SOC did not differ with residue
    management in RT (Table 1), although a slightly greater increase in SOC occurred
    with residue retention than with residue removal (Figure 8). This unexpected result
    is likely due to the limited number of observations with residue removal. Another
    possible reason is that the interaction between residue management and soil type
    may lead to various responses in SOC stocks. For example, residue removal increased
    SOC by 3.6% while residue retention had no effect on SOC in clay and clay loam
    soils. The decomposition of crop residues involves complex processes, which are
    controlled by multiple biogeochemical and biophysical conditions. Nitrogen fertilization
    noticeably increases SOC stock but with diminishing returns. For example, Blanco-Canqui
    et al. (2014) indicate that nitrogen fertilizer increases SOC when the nitrogen
    fertilization rate is below 80 kg N ha−1, above which it reduces aggregation and
    then decreases SOC stocks. Nitrogen fertilization can stimulate biological activity
    by altering carbon/nitrogen ratios, thereby promoting soil respiration and decreasing
    SOC content (Mulvaney, Khan, & Ellsworth, 2009); however, excessive nitrogen addition
    may reduce soil fungi populations, inhibit soil enzyme activity, and decrease
    CO2 emissions (Wilson & Al Kazi, 2008). These findings suggest that nitrogen fertilization
    enhances the positive effect of CSA management practices on SOC, likely through
    increased plant biomass production (Gregorich, Liang, Ellert, & Drury, 1996).
    However, nitrogen addition complicates the effects of biochar on SOC (Figure 9).
    Nitrogen fertilizer may affect biochar stability and the response of native SOC
    decomposition to biochar addition (Jiang, Haddix, & Cotrufo, 2016). Positive (Bebber,
    Watkinson, Boddy, & Darrah, 2011; Jiang, Cao, & Zhang, 2014) and negative (Pregitzer,
    Burton, Zak, & Talhelm, 2008) effects of nitrogen on SOC mineralization rates
    have been reported. These contrasting effects could be an alleviation of microbial
    nitrogen limitations (Jiang et al., 2016) and changes in the microbial decomposer
    community toward more efficient carbon-users (Janssens et al., 2010). A possible
    explanation of the various responses of nitrogen rate in biochar-modified soils
    is that either inadequate or excessive nitrogen addition may inhibit microbial
    activity to some extent, whereas medium-level nitrogen fertilization rates benefit
    microbes the most, which needs to be confirmed in future research. Aridity can
    limit plant growth and crop residue return and ultimately compromise SOC accumulation
    (Moreno, Murillo, Pelegrín, & Girón, 2006). Jien and Wang (2013) suggest that
    CSA management practices can potentially enhance soil water retention by improving
    soil porosity and erosion control. Irrigation ensures sufficient water for plant
    growth, resulting in more biomass production than in rainfed conditions (Capowiez
    et al., 2009; Chan, 2004; Shipitalo, Edwards, Dick, & Owens, 1990; Swanepoel,
    Laan, Weepener, Preez, & Annandale, 2016). The crop root density is much higher
    in irrigated conditions compared to rainfed conditions (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000),
    leading to higher organic matter input. Thus, CSA management practices in combination
    with irrigation could further increase SOC content. Rotational cropping potentially
    provides high carbon input to soils. Compared to continuous cropping systems,
    crops in rotational cropping systems have a greater belowground allocation of
    biomass (Van Eerd, Congreves, Hayes, Verhallen, & Hooker, 2014), resulting in
    more inputs of crop residue to the soil system. Enhancing rotation complexity
    can benefit carbon sequestration (West & Post, 2002). The present analysis suggests
    that all CSA practices can prominently increase SOC sequestration regardless of
    the crop rotation system. Biochar addition increased SOC more in rotational cropping
    systems than in continuous cropping systems, while cover crops increased SOC more
    in continuous systems (Figure 10). This is likely because cover crops increased
    the diversity of the original continuous systems, resulting in larger percentage
    changes in SOC content compared to rotational systems. Cover crop species introduce
    large uncertainties because the quantity and quality of cover crop residues may
    vary greatly with species. Residues with a high carbon/nitrogen ratio probably
    increase the amount of SOC (Duong, Baumann, & Marschner, 2009). The growth period
    of legume cover crops may be longer in continuous than in rotational cropping
    systems, thus providing more organic matter and nitrogen input to the soil. Ultimately,
    these processes would increase SOC stocks. The effect size of combined cover crops
    and conservation tillage was generally less than 11% (the sum of the effect size
    of cover crops and conservation tillage). However, in sandy clay loam and loamy
    sand soils, the sum of the effect size was 21% and 31%, respectively. Coarse-textured
    soils are not carbon-saturated and have great potential for carbon uptake. Cultivated
    land tends to suffer from SOC degradation, and SOC accumulation could quickly
    increase upon initiating farming practices due to high carbon inputs to the soil
    system (Vieira, Bayer, Zanatta, Mielniczuk, & Six, 2009). For example, in sandy
    loam soils, Higashi et al. (2014) showed that SOC increased by 22% with a combination
    of cover crops and NT. These results may be attributed to the stability of soil
    water-stable aggregates when cover crops are grown in sandy clay loam soils (McVay,
    Radcliffe, & Hargrove, 1989), given that aggregate stability has been linked to
    protection of SOC from mineralization (Unger, 1997). The combination of cover
    crops and conservation tillage significantly decreased SOC in clay soils. The
    reason for this unexpected result may be due to the limited number of study sites
    where this combination of treatments was evaluated (a few data pairs in our meta-analysis),
    and burning of cover crop biomass (Tian et al., 2005). 4.4 Uncertainty analysis
    and prospects Our meta-analysis, based on 3,049-paired comparisons from 417 peer-reviewed
    articles, quantitatively analyzed SOC changes as influenced by major CSA management
    practices and associated environmental factors and other agronomic practices.
    The publication bias analysis suggested that most results in this study are robust
    (Table S3). The accuracy and robustness of metadata analysis depend highly on
    both the data quality and quantity. A detailed statement of the experimental conditions
    will provide more information for in-depth analysis. Future CSA research also
    requires standardized field management, for example, the definitions and names
    of different conservation tillage methods should be uniform across studies to
    facilitate classification research. To the best of our knowledge, this study made
    the first attempt to examine synergistic effects when two or more CSA management
    practices are used together. Although our results present the positive effects
    of CSA management on soil carbon storage, especially when multiple management
    practices are adopted collectively, each practice may have constraints regarding
    enhancing soil carbon sequestration. The SOC benefit of CSA management practices
    strongly depends on environmental factors and other agronomic practices. Therefore,
    the choice of proper practices is potentially highly region specific. Our results
    imply that CSA may have great potential for climate change mitigation as the combination
    of conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar can theoretically enhance SOC
    by 50%. However, field experiments are still needed to support this claim. In
    addition, some CSA management practices may promote nitrous oxide or methane emissions
    (e.g., Huang et al., 2018; Kessel et al., 2013; Six, Ogle, Conant, Mosier, & Paustian,
    2004; Spokas & Reicosky, 2009), which, to some extent, would offset their benefit
    on climate change mitigation. Therefore, evaluating the CSA effects should also
    include non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane. We call for
    field experiments that can fully examine key indicators (such as soil carbon and
    greenhouse gases) in response to single and combined CSA management practices.
    Additionally, incorporating cover crops into current cropping systems could potentially
    alter conventional rotations. For example, cover crops in herbaceous crop rotations
    can substitute bare fallows or commercial crops. We only considered studies that
    treated cover crops as treatments and fallow (or weeds) as controls in this study.
    In comparison to bare fallows, cover crops can enhance soil health and quality
    (Jarecki & Lal, 2003). The benefits of cover crops include uptakes and stores
    of soil nutrients between seasons when they are susceptible to leaching (Doran
    & Smith, 1987). However, the substitution of commercial crops could reduce the
    productivity of the system, which has climatic implications related to the opportunity
    cost of the extra land required (e.g., Balmford et al., 2018; Searchinger, Wirsenius,
    Beringer, & Dumas, 2018). Thus, future studies should further address these potential
    side effects caused by land use change. Materials producing biochar may have other
    uses or fates, and the biochar-making processes may produce CO2 (e.g., Llorach-Massana
    et al., 2017), although biochar addition is an effective way to sequester SOC.
    These uncertainties, to some extent, can offset the benefits of biochar for climate
    change mitigation through SOC sequestration (Powlson, Riche, Coleman, Glendining,
    & Whitmore, 2008). The carbon footprint of biochar production depends on production
    technology and the types of feedstocks (Meyer et al., 2017). Mukherjee and Lal
    (2014) found that “carbon dioxide emissions from biochar-amended soils have been
    enhanced up to 61% compared with unamended soils.” However, with a low carbon
    footprint, each ton of biochar could sequester 21–155 kg of equivalent CO2 (Llorach-Massana
    et al., 2017). Matovic (2011) also suggested that 4.8 Gt C/year would be sequestered
    if 10% of the world''s net primary production were converted into biochar, “at
    50% yield and 30% energy from volatiles.” To fully understand the net impacts
    of biochar on climate mitigation, future studies should stress the carbon footprint
    in the lifecycle of biochar. It is essential to realistically examine the effects
    of CSA management practices on SOC and greenhouse gases at multiple scales from
    plot and field levels to regional and global scales. Therefore, future CSA research
    is expected to include varied climate and geographic conditions, address more
    biogeochemical and hydrological processes, and apply diverse methods such as the
    data-model fusion approach. For example, modeling studies have attempted to investigate
    regional cropland SOC dynamics as influenced by multiple global environmental
    changes while considering more traditional and less CSA practices (e.g., Molina,
    Moreno Pérez, & Pérez, 2017; Nash et al., 2018; Ren, Tian, Tao, Huang, & Pan,

    multiple common CSA management practices. Additional model evaluations are needed
    to quantify the potential of cropland carbon sequestration by adopting multiple

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\
    \ conceived the study idea and \ndeveloped the analysis plan. R.M. and S.W. analyzed\
    \ the data \nand wrote the initial paper.  \nM.N.H. helped to prepare the figures\
    \ and tables and \nfinalizing the manuscript. R.M. completed the final editing\
    \ \nand figures of the manuscript. All authors read the manuscript. \nREFERENCES\

    In this work, the Loma de Quinto irrigation district, located in Zaragoza (Spain)
    was characterised, and water use (WU) was assessed. The study was performed to
    contribute to the diagnostic analysis phase of an incipient management improvement
    process in this sprinkler-irrigated district. The objectives of this first paper
    of the series include: (1) characterising the irrigation systems, soil types and
    crops; (2) evaluating irrigation performance through the relationship between
    on-farm WU and net irrigation requirements (NIR); (3) identifying factors affecting
    on-farm WU. In order to accomplish these objectives, statistical analyses of field
    data, district records on WU and farmers’ interviews were performed. Technical
    deficiencies were detected in solid-sets, centre-pivots and linear-moves. A seasonal
    irrigation performance index (SIPI), defined as the percentage of NIR to seasonal
    water billing, was determined at each plot and for each of the three study years.
    The average inter-annual SIPI amounted to 127%, indicating that crops in the district
    were consistently water stressed. An analysis of the SIPI for the main crops in
    the district revealed that water stress was more intense in drought resistant
    and/or heavily subsidised crops (SIPI for sunflower was 142%). The average irrigation
    interval (12.3 days) and irrigation depth (44 mm) were too high for some of the
    soils in the district. Farmers adjusted the irrigation interval to meet the seasonal
    change in irrigation requirements. The irrigation depth was reduced in windy days.
    In two of the three study years, large plots used less water than small plots,
    at a rate of about −5 mm ha−1. The high cost of irrigation water in relation to
    crop revenues, the technical deficiencies of the irrigation systems, and the limitations
    imposed by climate and soils appeared to be major causes of local water management
    problems. In a companion paper, irrigation evaluations and simulations are presented,
    and irrigation schedules for optimal crop yield are proposed and evaluated via
    simulation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Sprinkler
    irrigationIrrigation performanceWater useFarm management 1. Introduction In many
    irrigation projects around the world, water use (WU) efficiencies are below the
    expected levels (Clemmens and Dedrick, 1992). Low efficiency can be attributed
    to inadequate irrigation structures, poor on-farm management and/or insufficient
    water availability. Currently, farmers are confronted with severe economical and
    environmental pressures. In the European Union, the Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) seeks to ensure the sustainability of agricultural systems without creating
    surpluses. Agricultural products must become more competitive in markets that
    are increasingly open at the international level (De Juan et al., 1996). In this
    context, farmers must change their production systems so that water is considered
    not only as a limited resource, but also as a production factor and a relevant
    economic input. A number of on-farm irrigation performance indexes have been defined
    (Merriam and Keller, 1978, Burt et al., 1997). These indexes quantify water management,
    and serve to identify problematic areas within an irrigated area. However, they
    do not inform on the reasons for the observed level of performance or provide
    guidance on how to improve it. Addressing performance problems is complex since
    improvement in farm water management must be viewed in the context of overall
    farm management. A Management Improvement Program (MIP) (Dedrick et al., 1993,
    Dedrick et al., 2000) is an effective way to identify both the strengths and the
    weaknesses of irrigated agriculture. The concept of MIP has evolved over the past
    20 years. Its main objective is to improve the performance and sustainability
    of irrigated agriculture. According to Dedrick et al. (2000), the MIP process
    incorporates: (1) a thorough understanding of the performance of irrigated agriculture
    in an area; (2) involvement by key decision makers in a joint decision process;
    (3) implementation of the planned changes by responsible operational managers.
    The MIP consists of three phases: diagnostic analysis, management planning and
    performance improvement. In the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District
    (MSIDD), located in central Arizona, an inter-organisational demonstration MIP
    was implemented in 1990 to assess its usefulness in the evaluation of the performance
    management. In the Ebro valley (Spain), irrigation districts have a varied technological
    level. Surface irrigation, using borders and level basins, is the most common
    irrigation method. In general, these irrigation systems are characterised by a
    low efficiency. Typical problems include: distribution systems with capacity below
    the peak demand; inflexible delivery rate and duration (usually in 24 h shifts);
    and poor on-farm land levelling (Faci et al., 2000, Playan et al., 2000). These
    authors analysed a surface irrigated district representative of the Ebro valley:
    the Almudévar Irrigation District (AID). The study characterised the district’s
    water management problems and evaluated modernisation scenarios. The authors concluded
    that the irrigation systems needed improvement and that the water distribution
    system was not able to provide a flexible and dependable water supply to the farmers.
    Consequently, they proposed a modernisation strategy based on the improvement
    of the conveyance structures and on conversion from surface to sprinkler irrigation.
    Currently, the Government of Spain is working on a program to modernise many irrigation
    districts. At the same time, public and private investments are being used to
    develop new irrigated areas using pressurised irrigation systems. These systems
    can attain irrigation efficiencies greater than 80% if adequately designed and
    managed (Keller and Bliesner, 1990, Clemmens and Dedrick, 1994). Little information
    is available in Spain about the current levels of irrigation efficiency under
    sprinkler irrigation systems. Therefore, assessing irrigation performance in these
    modern districts is an important issue to improve water management and preserve
    the quality of the environment. In this series of two papers, an analysis of WU
    and irrigation performance in the Loma de Quinto District (LQD) is presented.
    This analysis represents a contribution to the diagnostic analysis phase (Clyma
    and Lowdermilk, 1988, Dedrick et al., 2000) of an incipient MIP for the LQD. The
    next step will be to discuss this report in a multidisciplinary committee which
    will perform the diagnostic analysis not just on water issues, but on the current
    state of irrigated agriculture. The objectives of this first paper of the series
    include: (1) characterising the irrigation systems, soil types and crops present
    in the LQD; (2) evaluating irrigation performance through the relationship between
    on-farm WU and net irrigation requirements (NIR); (3) identifying factors affecting
    on-farm WU. In order to accomplish these objectives, statistical analyses of field
    data, district records on WU and farmers’ interviews were performed. 2. The study
    area The LQD was selected as the study area because farmers and district managers
    are interested in improving the profitability and sustainability of irrigated
    agriculture. From a technical point of view, the district is interesting because
    of the high cost of irrigation water (in comparison with crop revenues), the existence
    of WU records, the use of a wide variety of sprinkler irrigation systems, the
    limitations on irrigation operation imposed by the wind, and the variability in
    crops and soil types. The LQD is located about 40 km southeast of Zaragoza, Spain
    (Fig. 1). The district is an extension of an old irrigation district, the Traditional
    Quinto District (TQD), which diverts water from the Ebro River. The TQD, consisting
    of about a 1000 ha of surface irrigated land, was the basis of the Quinto economy
    for centuries. Since 1987 farmers in Quinto cultivate the old irrigated area plus
    the sprinkler-irrigated LQD. The LQD is located in a plateau about a 100 m above
    the TQD. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location of the LQD. The
    LQD covers 2606 ha, divided into 490 cadastral plots, and services 284 farmers
    (Lasierra, 1993). Each farmer cultivates a number of cadastral plots, which are
    usually spread throughout the district. Plot size varies between 0.2 and 71.8
    ha. A variety of sprinkler irrigation systems (solid-set, centre-pivot and linear-move),
    are used to irrigate field crops (alfalfa, corn, sunflower and wheat). Fruit trees
    are produced in a few plots equipped with micro irrigation systems. District soils
    are shallow, have low organic matter, and are high in calcium carbonate and gypsum.
    The Quinto climate is semiarid, with an average annual rainfall of 266 mm and
    an average reference evapotranspiration (ET0) of 1243 mm. A relevant feature of
    the Quinto climate is the presence of an intense wind from the NW–W, locally called
    “cierzo”. This wind produces large wind drift and evaporation losses and severely
    reduces irrigation uniformity in solid-sets (Faci and Bercero, 1991). Irrigation
    water is pumped from the Ebro River to a reservoir located at an elevation of
    132 m. Due to the energy requirement, the cost of water (0.034  m−3 in 1997) is
    very high in comparison with other districts of the Ebro basin growing field crops
    with surface irrigation (about 0.006  m−3). Water is supplied through a 60 km
    network of pressurised pipes. No additional pumping is required to convey water
    from the reservoir to the plots, although some farmers use booster pumps to increase
    the available pressure. All the hydrants are equipped with volumetric water meters.
    The distribution system is limited rate demand, as defined by Clemmens (1987).
    The board of the LQD manages the district. The board is composed of district farmers,
    who are elected by fellow farmers, occupying the positions of president, financing
    administrator and consultants. The LQD hires personnel such as the secretary and
    a number of technicians to operate and maintain the pumping station, the irrigation
    network, and the reservoir. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Temporal and spatial
    units of the study The current level of irrigation management was analysed using
    records of irrigation practices for three different irrigation seasons, chosen
    according to their ET0 (dry, average and humid) and to the availability of crop
    maps. The selected years were 1989, 1995 and 1997. The spatial unit of the study
    was the cadastral plot. This choice was dictated by the structure of the LQD management
    database and by the use of a geographic information system (GIS) containing cadastral
    information for mapping purposes. 3.2. Irrigation systems and cropping patterns
    A 1997 field survey was used to prepare maps of district irrigation systems and
    crop spatial distribution (Dechmi et al., 1998). Farmers have not changed their
    irrigation systems since district operations began, so the same irrigation systems
    map was used for all 3 years of the study. Crop maps for the 1989 and 1995 irrigation
    seasons were obtained from Casterad (1990). In 1998, a field survey was conducted
    to collect LQD irrigation systems characteristics in each plot (Tejero, 1999).
    This information includes sprinkler spacing, sprinkler line azimuth, pivot or
    ranger length, nozzle(s) diameter(s), operating pressure and nozzle height. 3.3.
    District water records Since farmers irrigate on demand, the district personnel
    does not take an active role in organising WU. The district technicians write
    down all the water meter readings monthly, and the district secretary uses a computer
    database to store the readings, determine the volumes of water used and prepare
    a monthly water bill for each farmer. Some hydrants supply water to a single farmer,
    while others are shared by a number of farmers. In the latter case, the secretary
    splits the cost of water according to the name, date and water volume recorded
    by the farmers themselves. A custom-made software is used to perform the database
    operations. This tool stores additional information, such as the size of the plots,
    the name and code of the owner, and the name of the irrigator. A general and a
    detailed study of WU in the district were conducted. In both cases we used information
    on water billing, and assumed that these volumes corresponded to actual WU. The
    technology applied in the LQD for water conveyance and measurement (pipes and
    water meters) makes this assumption much more reasonable than for districts using
    open ditches for water delivery, such as the AID (Faci et al., 2000). The general
    analysis examined the seasonal volume of water billed during the three years of
    study for entire district area. The detailed analysis focused on 17 plots (accounting
    for 44 ha), irrigated with solid-sets from 10 shared hydrants during the 1997
    the irrigation season. These plots were selected because the individual irrigation
    dates and volumes were available at the district database. Alfalfa (10 plots),
    corn (four plots) and wheat (three plots) were grown on these plots. 3.4. Soils
    Soil properties analysed in this study were soil depth (p, m) and total available
    water (TAW, mm). TAW was defined according to Walker and Skogerboe (1987), and
    computed after the following expression: (1) where θFC is the gravimetric water
    content ratio at 0.03 MPa (field capacity), θWP the gravimetric water content
    ratio at 1.50 MPa (wilting point), ρb the soil bulk density (Mg m−3), ρw the water
    density (Mg m−3), and S the volumetric ratio of stoniness. For the general study,
    the 19 soil units defined by Artieda (1998) in the Quinto soil map were grouped
    into five classes according to their p and TAW (Table 1). For the 17 plots analysed
    in detail, p and S were determined in situ. Pressure plates were used to determine
    θFC and θWP, with two replicates per sample. In total, 39 samples were collected,
    using two or three samples per plot (characterising different soil horizons).
    ρb was set to 1.5 Mg m−3, based on studies in the area (Artieda, 1998). Table

    practices were analysed through an interview prepared and conducted in 1998. Twenty-one
    farmers were randomly selected for the interviews. The questionnaire consisted
    of 67 multiple choice questions about the farmer’s irrigation systems and management
    practices. Other questions were devoted to establish if the farmers cultivated
    plots on lease and to compare irrigated agriculture in the LDQ and TQD (Tejero,
    1999). 3.6. Net irrigation requirements Irrigation requirements were estimated
    using the standard FAO procedures, as described by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977)
    and Allen et al. (1998), and implemented in the CROPWAT software (Smith, 1993,
    Clarke et al., 1998). Following these procedures, Penman–Monteith reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0), crop coefficients (Kc), crop evapotranspiration (ETc), effective precipitation
    (PE) and NIR (mm) were estimated. These estimations relied on mean monthly meteorological
    data recorded at the Quinto climatic station, located at a north latitude of 41°25′25″,
    a west longitude of 0°30′30″ and an altitude of 190 m. The data used included:
    maximum and minimum air temperature, maximum and minimum relative air humidity,
    precipitation, sunshine duration and wind speed. Missing minimum air humidity
    and sunshine duration data were replaced with data from the Zaragoza climatic
    station. Duration of the crop development phases and primary crop coefficients
    (Kc) were obtained from Martinez-Cob et al. (1998). Monthly effective precipitation
    (PE) for 1989 and 1995 was determined using the USDA method (Cuenca, 1989). In
    view of the abnormally large rainfall recorded in 1997, PE for this season was
    calculated using the empirical method of PE (Smith, 1993). NIR were determined
    for the dominant crops (alfalfa, corn, sunflower and wheat). 3.7. WU, irrigation
    efficiency and seasonal irrigation performance index (SIPI) The performance measure
    used to characterise WU in the LQD was the SIPI, as defined by Faci et al. (2000)
    and applied to the AID. The SIPI is defined as the percentage of NIR to seasonal
    WU (mm), estimated from billing records. SIPI represents a simplification of the
    irrigation efficiency standard concept defined by Burt et al. (1997) and Clemmens
    and Burt (1997). However, if a crop is water stressed, the value of the SIPI can
    be higher than 100%. In fact, if the SIPI is higher than the potential application
    efficiency of the irrigation system, the crop will be water stressed. Clemmens
    and Dedrick (1994) presented values of potential application efficiency for well
    designed and managed irrigation systems. Solid-sets range from 70 to 85%, while
    pivots and rangers range from 75 to 90%. We estimated an average value of potential
    application efficiency of 80% for all irrigation systems in the district. This
    value was considered as a threshold separating full irrigation (SIPI<80%) from
    deficit irrigation (SIPI>80%). The SIPI was computed for each representative crop
    and year of the study. 3.8. Identifying factors affecting WU Contingency tables
    were used to test possible interactions between the crops and three other categorical
    variables: type of irrigation system, type of farmer (owner or leaser) and soil
    TAW class. The goal of this analysis was to determine if these factors affected
    the choice of crop for each plot and study year. Two types of correlation analyses
    were conducted for the detailed study. Their purpose was to gain insight on farmers’
    irrigation decision making, with particular reference to the main climatic limiting
    factor: wind speed. The first type of analysis involved data from individual irrigation
    events. The selected variables were: irrigation depth (mm), irrigation interval
    (days), wind speed (m s−1) and date of each irrigation event (DOY, day of the
    year). The second type of analysis involved seasonal variables: the seasonal depth
    of water applied to each plot (mm), the average wind speed during the irrigation
    days (m s−1), the average irrigation depth (mm), the average irrigation interval
    (days) and the SIPI (%). Multiple regression with dummy variables was applied
    to study the interaction between quantitative and categorical variables in the
    general study, following the procedures used by Clemmens and Dedrick (1992) to
    analyse WU in the MSIDD. The dependant variables considered in this work were
    the seasonal WU and the SIPI. The plot area and the total area managed by the
    farmer in the LDQ were introduced as independent quantitative variables. These
    variables were included to assess the relationship between WU and land tenure,
    under the hypothesis that large plots or more professional farmers would promote
    water conservation. The independent categorical variables were the type of crop,
    the irrigation system, the soil class and the type of farmer (owner vs. leaser).
    The statistical model was developed by first including all the factors and then
    removing insignificant factors individually and iteratively. 4. Results and discussion
    4.1. Characterisation of irrigation systems, soils and crops The spatial distribution
    of irrigation systems is depicted in Fig. 2. Solid-sets are used mainly in the
    north and northeast areas, while centre-pivots and linear-moves are common in
    the southwest, where plots are larger. This distribution can also be related to
    soil surface elevation, which is higher in the south. Higher pressures are available
    to operate the solid-set systems in the northern part of the LQD. The average
    area of solid-set plots is 4.0 ha. The most common sprinkler spacing is triangular,
    with sprinklers at every 21 m in the line and the lines separated 18 m. This spacing
    is used in 79% of the total solid-set area. Most of the plots (54%) are equipped
    with 5.1 and 2.4 mm diameter nozzles. The average operating pressure in the solid-set
    systems was 270 kPa. For similar hardware and operating conditions, Tarjuelo (1995)
    recommended an operating pressure in the range of 300–400 kPa, sensibly higher
    than the average observed value. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Map
    of irrigation systems in the LQD. Solid-set uniformity can be severely reduced
    in the presence of strong winds. A common wind defence is to set the sprinkler
    lines perpendicular to the dominant winds (Keller and Bliesner, 1990). In the
    case of triangular sprinkler spacings, this recommendation becomes more complicated,
    due to the fact that three possible sprinkler lines (forming angles of 60°) could
    be drawn around any given sprinkler (Fig. 3). In this particular case, the best
    protection against wind is an orientation with one of the lines (the horizontal
    line in Fig. 3) perpendicular to the wind direction. Therefore, the minimum angle
    between the dominant wind and a sprinkler line is 30°. In this case, the distance
    between sprinklers in a direction perpendicular to the wind is minimum, with a
    value of 10.5 m. As a result, the applied irrigation water attains a reasonable
    coverage of the soil. In the worst case one of the sprinkler lines is parallel
    to the wind direction. In this case the sprinkler spacing in the wind direction
    attains a maximum value of 18 m. This results in strips of non-irrigated land
    during windy irrigations. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Representation
    of best and worst orientation cases between the wind and the sprinkler line for
    a triangular 21 m×18 m spacing. Dots represent sprinklers and ellipsoids represent
    the area wetted by each individual sprinkler. In order to assess the wind protection
    characteristics of the LQD solid-sets, plots were classified according to the
    sprinkler line azimuth. Considering the axes of symmetry in Fig. 3, azimuths were
    reduced to an interval of 5–65°, divided into six 10° intervals. Accordingly,
    the average wind azimuth of 293° was reduced to an orientation of 53° (subtracting
    240°). Fig. 4 confronts a histogram of the sprinkler line orientation groups with
    the dominant wind direction. The best sprinkler line orientation would be between
    15° and 25° (approximately 30° angle with the dominant wind direction). Plots
    with optimally oriented lines represent 19.5% of the total solid-set area (Fig.
    4). In the LQD, 58.9% of the sprinkler lines present adequate orientations (considered
    between 5° and 35°), suggesting that the design principle was only slightly considered.
    Additional wind protection could have been obtained at the design phase through
    a more careful sprinkler line orientation. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. Histogram of sprinkler line orientation in LQD, with indication of the
    dominant wind direction. The average area of the plots irrigated with centre-pivots
    is 13.6 ha. Centre-pivot systems are usually equipped with low pressure fixed
    spray plate sprinklers of different diameters located on top of the lateral, at
    4.5 m over the soil surface. Recent developments in irrigation technology, such
    as rotating spray plate sprinklers (Faci et al., 2001) have not been introduced
    in the area. In 12% of centre-pivots, farmers have lowered the nozzles in order
    to conserve irrigation water. In some cases, nozzles have only been lowered at
    the outer part of the centre-pivot. The average area of the plots irrigated with
    linear-move systems is 7.2 ha. These machines are also equipped with low pressure
    fixed plate spray sprinklers. In half of the linear-move machines the spray sprinklers
    are located at an elevation of 4.7 m over the soil surface. In the rest, the spray
    sprinklers have been lowered to an average height of 2.6 m. A common trait of
    the LQD systems is the lack of irrigation automation. The interview revealed that
    86% of the farmers did not use any automation equipment, while the remaining 14%
    used automation in some farms. The lack of automation devices poses a severe limitation
    to irrigation scheduling and to adapting the irrigation depth to the soil TAW.
    Soils in the LQD show a large variation in water holding capability (Table 1).
    Most soils (70% of the area) have values of TAW ranging from 60 to 140 mm. Because
    of its low TAW, the S1 class shows relevant limitations for irrigation, and requires
    frequent, light irrigations. Soil classes S4 and S5 have a high TAW (160–300 mm)
    but are fine textured, saline and exhibit low infiltration and poor aeration.
    Therefore, they have low agronomic value. Main crops in the LQD were wheat and
    corn in 1989, and alfalfa in 1995 and 1997 (Table 2). The category “mixed crops”
    was relevant in the 3 years of study. It includes the plots in which farmers divide
    the total area to grow more than one crop at a time. This is a common practice
    in large plots. Table 2. Crop distribution in the LQD during the study years Crop

    4.2. Evaluation of irrigation performance Seasonal water diversions in the LQD
    varied strongly during the study years. According to the pumping station records,
    the highest diversion occurred in 1995 (21.7×106 m3), while in 1989 and 1997 diversions
    were much lower (10.9×106 and 13.2×106 m3, respectively). The average WU was 477,
    995 and 585 mm, for the 1989, 1995 and 1997 years, respectively. Table 3 presents
    the distribution of the district plots in classes of WU for the 3 years of study.
    The variability in water application may reflect differences in crops, soils,
    irrigation systems and irrigation management. The effect of the crop on WU is
    illustrated in Table 4. The associated coefficients of variation ranged from 27
    to 63%, indicating that additional factors determine WU. Table 3. Percent distribution

    stress their crops (Table 4). Only in one case (wheat in 1995) the average SIPI
    was lower than the estimated potential application efficiency (80%). Sunflower
    was severely water stressed during all the study years, with an inter-annual average
    SIPI of 142%. Alfalfa and wheat had average values of SIPI of 128 and 113%. The
    inter-annual average of the SIPI value for corn was 111%, the lowest among all
    crops. These data suggest that farmers try to optimise irrigation WU restricting
    application on drought resistant crops (sunflower, wheat, alfalfa), and limiting
    water stress on drought sensitive crops (corn). The subsidies of the European
    Union play a relevant role in the SIPI. Subsidies are applied by the hectare,
    and amount to a variable percentage of each crop gross income. In the case of
    sunflower subsidies were comparatively high in the years of study, and therefore
    farmers did not consider yield as the main source of income. Consequently, sunflower
    was systematically underirrigated. Faci et al. (2000) reported a similar finding
    for the AID, based on data from 1994. The district average SIPI (computed in all
    plots) was 155, 95 and 131 for the years 1989, 1995 and 1997, respectively. These
    values indicate that the SIPI followed inter-annual trends that could not be explained
    by the aridity of the analysed years. Crop water stress was considerable during
    the years 1989 and 1997. In 1995, which was considered as an average year with
    an average evaporative demand, the seasonal amount of irrigation water applied
    to alfalfa, corn and wheat was higher than their NIR. A correlation analysis between
    the SIPI values obtained in the same plots in the three study years was performed.
    The purpose of this analysis was to assess how on-farm irrigation performance
    changed in the study years. Results showed a weak correlation between the SIPI
    values of years 1989 and 1995 (0.168*), with no significant correlation between
    years 1989 and 1997. However, there was a strongly significant correlation between
    the SIPI values of years 1995 and 1997 (0.484***). This finding suggests that
    on-farm irrigation performance has evolved during the life of the LQD. The criteria
    for water allocation in each plot were particularly consistent between 1995 and
    1997, after almost 10 years of irrigation operation. Results from the detailed
    analysis showed that the average irrigation depth per irrigation event ranged
    from 18 to 73 mm, with an average of 44 mm and a CV of 30%. This irrigation depth
    is compatible with the interview results: 60% of the farmers use solid-set irrigation
    durations of 8 h or more. The average irrigation interval varied from 8.6 to 28.0
    days, with an average of 12.3 days and a CV of 40%. These irrigation depths and
    intervals are too high for sprinkler irrigation in general and for the LQD soils
    in particular. The irrigation systems used in the district permit to apply frequent,
    light irrigations, at the only additional expense of labour or automation equipment.
    The previous results state that farmers underirrigate their crops in the LQD.
    The interview included a few questions on this topic, formulated as a comparison
    between WU in the LQD and the TQD. The 43% of the farmers used “more water” in
    the TQD than in the LQD, while the remaining 57% used “much more water”. The 89%
    of the farmers reported that crop yield was higher in the TQD than in the LQD.
    All of the interviewed farmers obtained higher profits in the TQD. Low seasonal
    irrigation depths, large irrigation intervals and poor soils seem sufficient to
    explain the low yields. The added factor of high water cost explains the reduced
    economic benefit in the LQD as compared to the TQD. 4.3. Identifying factors affecting
    WU The first step was the analysis of contingency tables between categorical variables
    of the general analysis. Only in the first year of study (1989), a statistical
    relationship was found between crops and irrigation systems. Farmers did not grow
    alfalfa and sunflower in the plots equipped with irrigation machines (linear-move
    and pivot), using them for corn and wheat. This trend was discontinued in the
    following years. Both types of farmers (owners and leasers) grow the same crops
    in the LQD, and distribute them throughout the district area regardless of the
    soil types. The second phase of the statistical study involved the analysis of
    correlation matrices established between the quantitative variables of the detailed
    study. First, the correlation analysis was performed on individual irrigation
    events (Table 5). One of the most relevant characteristics of this table is that
    the correlation coefficients are low (below 0.3 in absolute value). This will
    be a constant in the rest of this study. The explanation for this fact lies in
    the nature of the data, which were obtained from the farmers’ database. In our
    opinion, farmers have not been particularly careful in checking the accuracy of
    some variables. We believe that the water measurements are reliable, since water
    billing depends on these measurements and farmers use about one-fourth of their
    gross income to pay the water bill. Problems seem to accumulate in the estimation
    of the irrigated area. In some cases, not all the plot area was actually irrigated.
    In other cases, the water assigned to a plot seems to have been used to irrigate
    neighbouring plots owned by the same farmer. Our perception is that even if the
    farmers’ database adequately allocates costs among farmers, it shows limitations
    when it comes to ensuring water traceability with respect to plots and crops.

    interval (days) 0.0487 ns −0.2753*** Wind speed (km h−1) −0.2099*** Date (–) A
    weak, negative correlation coefficient (r=−0.1411*) was found between irrigation
    depth and wind speed (Table 5). In windy days farmers applied light irrigations,
    and seemed to wait for calm days to apply the gross of water requirements. The
    interview confirmed that this practice was followed by 70% of the farmers. As
    an additional confirmation, the average wind speed in irrigation days (for all
    plots in the detailed study) was 0.92 m s−1, whereas the average seasonal wind
    speed was 1.25 m s−1. According to the farmers’ interview, 95, 85, and 50% of
    the farmers avoided irrigating in windy days with their solid-sets, pivots and
    rangers, respectively. The irrigation depth (per irrigation event) was not related
    to the irrigation date (Table 5), suggesting that farmers used fixed irrigation
    depths throughout the season, and met the irrigation requirements adjusting the
    irrigation interval. In fact, the irrigation interval showed a decrease in time
    during the irrigation season, reflecting the increased water demand during spring
    and mid summer. According to the interview, this procedure was followed by 76%
    of the farmers. A significant, negative correlation between wind speed and irrigation
    date was found. Since the wind speed did not show a significant time dependence
    during the irrigation season (data not presented), it can be concluded that farmers
    became increasingly selective with the wind speed on irrigation days as the season
    progressed. A second set of correlation analyses was performed using seasonal
    data from each plot of the detailed study. The correlation between seasonal WU
    and average irrigation interval (r=−0.5563*) serves to confirm part of the previous
    results: those farmers applying large seasonal irrigation depths used small irrigation
    intervals. The lack of correlation between seasonal WU and average irrigation
    depth confirms that the management variable was the number of irrigation events
    (and therefore the irrigation interval). The last step of the statistical analysis
    consisted on formulating multiple regression models using dummy variables to incorporate
    categorical variables. Such models were first applied to explain the variability
    on WU (Table 6). The plot area resulted significant in 1989 and 1997, with coefficients
    of −4.2 and −5.4 mm ha−1, suggesting that large plots have a potential to conserve
    water. The total area managed by the farmer and the type of farmer (owner vs.
    leaser) did not result significant in any of the three study years. Since management
    does not seem to be the key of a lower WU, the benefits of large plots seem to
    be due to a better irrigation technology. Clemmens and Dedrick (1992), when analysing
    the MSIDD, found that the area managed by the farmer was statistically relevant
    on WU, and determined a coefficient of about 1 mm ha−1, between four and five
    times smaller than the one reported in this research for plot size. In the MSIDD
    the type of farmer was also significantly related to WU. Faci et al. (2000), analysing
    the AID, identified a large dependence of WU on plot size, although they reported
    a number of administrative procedures increasing the volume of water billed to
    small farms. Table 6. Results of the multiple regression with dummy variables

    −14.1 ns Hand move – a −612.7* a In 1995 the plots equipped with hand move systems
    were excluded from the statistical analysis since their number was very low. The
    other factors affecting WU were the type of crop and the type of irrigation system.
    As expected, corn, sunflower and wheat used less water than alfalfa, although
    in some cases the contrast between alfalfa and corn and even sunflower was not
    significant. In 1995 and 1997 wheat and particularly sunflower showed a reduced
    WU. As for the irrigation systems, differences were not significant in 1989. In
    1995 and 1997 the variable was significant, solid-sets were the systems using
    most water, and only one contrast was significant in each year (linear-move in
    1995 and hand move in 1997). In a context of increasing labour scarcity, hand
    move systems showed small WU, and were associated to marginal plots. When multiple
    regression was used to explain the variability on the SIPI, the number of significant
    factors increased towards the end of the study period (Table 7). In 1989, the
    SIPI could not be explained by any of the considered factors. In the 1995 irrigation
    season, crop type was the only significant variable, and sunflower was the only
    crop showing significant differences with alfalfa. Factors affecting the SIPI
    during the 1997 irrigation season were the type of crop, the irrigation system
    and the soil type. The statistical analysis showed that the corn SIPI values were
    49% smaller than the alfalfa SIPI values. The effect of the type of irrigation
    system only served to separate the hand move system from the rest of the systems.
    The relationship found between the soil type and the SIPI values indicated significant
    differences between low and average TAW values. Table 7. Results of the multiple
    regression with dummy variables used to characterise the factors affecting the

    performed for WU and SIPI were low (ranging between 7.7 and 41.7%). The quality
    of the data sources and the variability induced by irrigation farming operations
    are probable causes of this dispersion. 5. Conclusions The analysis of irrigation
    WU during three irrigation seasons (dry, average and humid) was used to characterise
    the performance of relatively modern irrigation systems in the LQD. The following
    conclusions can be drawn from this analysis: 1. Most of the solid-set sprinkler
    systems in the LQD use wide sprinkler spacings (  m). The current operating pressure
    is too low to ensure adequate water distribution. Additional wind protection could
    have been obtained through a narrower spacing and/or a more careful sprinkler
    line orientation. 2. Centre-pivot and linear-move irrigation machines use fixed
    spray plate sprinklers. Recent developments in sprinklers for irrigation machines
    have not been introduced in the LQD. In about one-third of the machines, sprinklers
    have been lowered (from about 4.7 to 2.6 m) to improve water conservation. 3.
    Field crops are grown in the LQD (alfalfa, corn, sunflower and wheat). The average
    WU was 477 mm in 1989, 995 mm in 1995 and 585 mm in 1997. This variability in
    water application could not be adequately explained by the aridity of the study
    years or the changes in the cropping pattern. 4. The average inter-annual SIPI
    was 127%. Farmers regularly stressed their crops, particularly those characterised
    by their drought resistance and those receiving large subsidies applied by the
    hectare. 5. The average irrigation depth per irrigation event was 44 mm, and the
    seasonal average irrigation interval was 12.3 days. These values are too high,
    particularly for the soils characterised by a low TAW. 6. Farmers seem to respond
    to strong winds by applying light irrigations, and reserve large irrigation events
    for calm days. In general, farmers modify the irrigation interval rather than
    the depth in order to accommodate the irrigation schedule to the NIR. 7. Large
    plots used less water than small plots, at a rate of about −5 mm ha−1. Similar
    findings (but different rates) were reported in previous works on surface-irrigated
    districts (Clemmens and Dedrick, 1992, Faci et al., 2000). 8. Multiple regression
    models on SIPI became more complex along the three study years. In 1997 the significant
    dependent variables included the crop, type of irrigation system and soil type.
    The high cost of irrigation water in relation to crop revenues, the technical
    deficiencies of the irrigation systems, and the limitations imposed by the climate
    and soils appear to be major causes of the water management problems identified
    in the LQD. The validity of our results may be limited by the origin of the WU
    data (the district’s database). While these data are used for water billing in
    an area in which the cost of irrigation water represents a large percentage of
    the crop gross income, the database may include water allocation errors. In a
    companion paper, irrigation evaluations and simulations performed on different
    irrigation systems at the LQD will be presented. Irrigation schedules for optimal
    crop yield will also be proposed and evaluated via simulation. Acknowledgements

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.

    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    Abstract In order to simulate historical Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and
    Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) solar resources, a method using MODIS level 3 (L3)
    daily satellite data as input to the REST2 clear sky model is presented to derive
    clear sky solar irradiance for California. MODIS L3 precipitable water (PW) and
    especially aerosol optical depth (AOD) were found to be significantly biased and
    were therefore calibrated based on AOD and PW from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)
    ground monitoring sites. For reference, MODIS input data was replaced by the following
    input data sources: 3 hourly PW and AOD from Monitoring Atmosphere Composition
    and Climate (MACC) and monthly climatological Linke Turbidity from Solar radiation
    Data (SoDa). Similarly, other clear sky models, specifically Ineichen and McClear,
    were also run for reference. Validation was conducted using irradiance anomalies
    defined as the difference between irradiance and its 15 day moving average against
    ground measurement from California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS),
    National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Integrated Surface Irradiance
    Study (ISIS) stations. It was found that the calibration of MODIS data markedly
    improves the accuracy of modeled GHI and DNI anomalies and REST2 clear sky model
    with calibrated MODIS data achieved the highest accuracy among all model and input
    data combinations. The improvement in accuracy of PW and AOD input data through
    calibration is relatively more important than the choice of clear sky model. Previous

    Solar energy potential in a specific area depends on the local solar radiation
    resource. Since the atmospheric composition changes over minutes to seasonal and
    sometimes even annual time scales, solar resource assessment requires assessing
    the variation of solar radiation over multiple years (Gurtuna and Prevot, 2011).
    The ideal case is to use data from a well-maintained ground station near the site,
    but this scenario is unlikely since there are few such ground stations throughout
    the world. Alternatively, satellite data consisting of a clear sky model that
    is modulated by a cloud index (Gueymard and Thevenard, 2009, Gueymard and Wilcox,
    2011, Mueller et al., 2004) allows nearly global coverage at fine spatial resolutions
    of one to a few km and temporal resolutions of 5–30 min (Gueymard, 2008, Miller
    et al., 2013, Perez et al., 2013, Renné et al., 2008). Therefore, satellite-derived
    solar irradiation is becoming more widely accepted and important to obtain financing
    for solar power projects (Gueymard, 2012a, Gurtuna and Prevot, 2011, Vignola et
    al., 2012). One critical input to most semi-empirical satellite irradiance models
    is the clear sky irradiance. For example, Jamaly et al. (2012) showed that clear
    sky differences in a satellite based solar resource product, SolarAnywhere, explained
    most of the annual bias at sites throughout California. SolarAnywhere is a 1 km
    high resolution solar resource dataset and provides irradiation derived from Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible imagery at 1 km spatial and
    30 min temporal resolution. REST2, METSTAT and Ineichen are considered the most
    accurate simple broadband clear sky irradiance models with an accuracy of a first
    class pyrheliometer (Gueymard, 2010, Reno et al., 2012). Lefèvre et al. (2013)
    developed an entirely physically-based clear sky model, McClear, with aerosol
    properties (primarily aerosol optical depth, AOD) as well as precipitable water
    (PW) provided by Monitoring Atmosphere Composition and Climate (MACC). MACC combines
    atmospheric modeling with earth observation data including both satellite and
    in-situ data, to provide aerosol properties and total column water vapor globally
    (Kaiser et al., 2012). In this paper, the accuracy of REST2, Ineichen, and McClear
    derived Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
    is compared. The REST2 model accuracy depends mostly on the quality of the input
    data, especially the AOD and PW (Gueymard, 2012b, Reno et al., 2012). A sensitivity
    study and error analysis (Gueymard, 2003) demonstrated that the predicted irradiances
    are very sensitive to errors in the Angstrom turbidity coefficient that is calculated
    using AOD and Angstrom’s wavelength Exponent. Generally, satellite observations
    of AOD over land are less accurate because variable surface reflectance, e.g.
    due to seasonal changes of vegetation, leaves a similar signature as variability
    in AOD (Hauser et al., 2005a). Currently, AOD data is available from e.g. the
    Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MISR), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite platforms.
    AVHRR has been in orbit continuously since 1981 but an AOD product over land has
    only recently been developed (Hauser et al., 2005b). MISR and MODIS were designed
    for AOD retrievals and provide robust retrievals of AOD over land. Statistical
    comparisons of coincident AOD over land between MISR and MODIS by Kahn et al.
    (2009) showed a correlation coefficient of 0.7. In addition, MODIS provides PW
    with typical errors estimated to range between 5% and 10% (Gao and Kaufman, 2003).
    The combined land and ocean AOD MODIS level 3 (L3) daily (derived from one image
    at the overpass time) product is derived from the 0.55 μm channel of the Terra
    satellite and has been available since 2000. Ruiz-Arias et al. (2012) showed a
    reduction in the bias of GHI and DNI when the MODIS L3 AOD was input to the Goddard
    Space Flight Center (GSFC) shortwave scheme (Chou and Suarez, 1994) in the regional
    Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Ruiz-Arias et al. (2012) also compared
    GHI and DNI from GSFC against REST2 and showed that the GSFC is comparable to
    REST2 for GHI and less accurate than REST2 for DNI. In this paper, AOD, MODIS
    L3 daily PW, and Angstrom exponent are input into REST2 to model clear sky GHI
    and DNI. Since large biases in satellite PW and AOD were observed in California,
    MODIS PW and AOD were calibrated using ground data from 11 AERONET sites (Section
    3). For comparison, MACC reanalysis AOD and PW as well as the derived Angstrom
    exponent from AOD at 0.55 and 1.24 μm (Lefèvre et al., 2013) are input to REST2
    (without calibration). REST2 GHI and DNI and the Ineichen and McClear clear sky
    models are validated against GHI and DNI ground observations (Sections 4 GHI and
    DNI validation methods, 5 Validation). GHI (DNI) anomalies were calculated by
    subtracting the moving average of GHI (DNI) on clear days within a 15 day period
    at the Terra overpass time (see Eq. (9) later). The flow chart for the analysis
    is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow chart for
    the calibrations, model applications, and validations in the paper. 2. Data 2.1.
    REST2 input data Table 1 shows the input parameters to REST2 (Gueymard, 2012b).
    The MODIS aboard two satellites, Terra and Aqua, measures atmospheric, oceanic,
    land surface, and cryospheric features of the entire Earth surface every 1–2 days
    (John, 2014, Remer et al., 2005). Over highly reflective surfaces such as deserts
    (e.g. Sahara) and snow covered mountains, MODIS data is not available (Ruiz-Arias
    et al., 2013). MODIS L3 atmospheric products are available over Daily, 8-Day,
    and Monthly temporal scales. In this paper, the MODIS L3 daily product is chosen,
    which becomes available approximately 20 days after measurement. The daily variability
    of clear sky solar radiation, which is important for solar power forecasting,
    cannot be demonstrated if only monthly data is used, since monthly AOD data captures
    only about half of the AOD variability (Gueymard, 2012c). Ruiz-Arias et al. (2013)
    concluded that MODIS L3 AOD is of sufficient quality to produce accurate GHI at
    the regional scale introducing an uncertainty of approximately 15% in DNI and
    less than 5% for GHI using REST2 (for AOD smaller than 0.5). In this paper we
    show that calibration (Section 3) makes the MODIS L3 AOD and PW more accurate.

    is calculated using the linearization of Angstrom’s law (Gueymard, 2008) which
    yields (1) from (see Table 1 for nomenclature). MODIS L3 AOD at  μm is used for
    and α is the average MODIS L3 Angstrom Exponent (Land) for 0.47 and 0.66 μm. Both
    and α are derived from MODIS L2 data using quality assurance (QA) weighted statistics
    (Hubanks et al., 2008) as where is MODIS L3 AOD or Angstrom exponent, di is the
    L2 AOD or Angstrom exponent, and wi is the L2 QA value.1 While REST2 treats the
    UV and visible (from 0.29 to 0.70 μm), and near-infrared (from 0.7 to 4 μm) bands
    separately (Gueymard, 2008), the α above is used for both bands because Angstrom
    exponents are only available for 0.47 and 0.66 μm. Since the average MODIS pixel
    elevation is different from that of an AERONET ground site within the pixel, and,
    on average, AOD tends to decrease exponentially with altitude in the free troposphere
    the scale height (Ha) concept (Gueymard and Thevenard, 2009) is used to correct
    for elevation changes as (2) where h0 is the average elevation of the MODIS pixel
    derived from the 1 km by 1 km elevation data from the Weather Research and Forecasting
    (WRF) model within the MODIS pixel (see Table 4, Section 3); h is the elevation
    of the corresponding AERONET site; AOD(h0) is the MODIS L3 AOD before elevation
    correction; and Ha is 2100 m for the six coastal (CalTech, El Segundo, La Jolla,
    Monterey, Trinidad Head and UCSB) and 2900 m for the six inland AERONET sites
    respectively. Similarly, MODIS L3 PW is corrected for elevation using Eq. (2)
    since water vapor is concentrated near the surface; Hw is 2100 m for coastal and
    2500 m for inland AERONET sites respectively. We use the following elevation-corrected
    MODIS products from the Terra satellite: Aerosol Optical Thickness at 0.55 μm
    for both Ocean and Land (variable name: “Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean_Mean”) and
    Precipitable Water Vapor (IR Retrieval, variable name: “Atmospheric_Water_Vapor_QA_Mean”).
    Pressure is temporally interpolated from 3 hourly pressure from the NCEP North
    American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) which assimilates comprehensive observational
    data. NARR pressure is extrapolated to the ground station elevation using (3)
    where p2 and h2 are the pressure and elevation of the ground station, p1 is 3
    hourly NARR pressure at the Terra overpass time, h1 is the average elevation of
    the NARR pixel covering the ground station and R is the gas constant for dry air.
    NARR temperature is used as T which is a reasonable assumption because of small
    sensitivity and small height differences between ground stations and NARR pixels.
    MACC reanalysis has been provided by the European Center for Medium-range Weather
    Forecast (ECMWF) since 2003. MODIS total aerosol optical depth is assimilated
    in the MACC reanalysis aerosol optical properties (Bellouin et al., 2013, Benedictow
    et al., 2014). However, unlike MODIS L3 which is an area average, MACC data are
    gridded point data (ECMWF, 2014). In this paper, MACC reanalysis 3 hourly data
    at 0.125° spatial resolution from MACC (2014) are used including “Total Aerosol
    Optical Depth at 550 nm”, “Total Aerosol Optical Depth at 1240 nm” as well as
    “Total column water vapour”. MACC Angstrom exponents are derived from AOD at 0.55
    and 1.24 μm (Lefèvre et al., 2013) using (4) where and optical thickness at  μm
    and  μm. Scale height corrections are also applied to MACC AOD and PW data and
    the MACC grid point elevation (h0 in Eq. (2)) is calculated from the MACC surface
    geopotential height and provided in Table 4. 2.2. Ineichen input data Ineichen
    and Perez (2002) developed a clear sky model for GHI based on the Linke turbidity
    factor TL. In this paper the Ineichen model serves as a benchmark for other more
    complicated models. Ineichen (2008a) developed an expression for TL (for airmass
    equal to 2) as a function of atmospheric water vapor, aerosol optical depth, and
    altitude of the site as (5) where p0 is the sea level atmospheric pressure. Eq.
    (5) showed negligible mean bias difference when evaluated against the radiative
    transfer model Modtran (Berk et al., 1989). Using Eq. (5), both MODIS and MACC
    data are converted to TL and input to Ineichen model. In addition the Ineichen
    model is run with climatological TL input data from Solar radiation Data (SoDa),
    a global TL database based on satellite data (Remund et al., 2003, SoDa, 2012).
    2.3. McClear input data A free Web service2 delivers historical timeseries of
    global McClear clear sky irradiation with time steps as short as 1 min. The inputs
    to McClear are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. McClear inputs. In addition, solar
    zenith angle and other parameters related to geographical location and time are
    required. MCD43C1 are MODIS L3 16-day products at spatial resolution of 0.05°
    and provide three parameters fully describing the bidirectional reflectance distribution

    aerosol species (Benedetti et al., 2009) 2.4. AERONET data The AERONET (Aerosols
    Robotic Network, Holben et al., 1998, Holben et al., 2001) is a globally distributed
    network of identical robotically controlled ground-based sun photometers which
    measure atmospheric aerosol properties and compute AOD at three data quality levels:
    Level 1.0 (unscreened), Level 1.5 (cloud-screened), and Level 2.0 (cloud-screened
    and quality-assured). Since AERONET does not measure at 0.55 μm the comparison
    with MODIS L3 AOD at 0.55 μm requires that AOD at 0.55 μm is calculated from the
    level 2.0 AOD centered at 0.675 μm together with the level 2.0 Angstrom exponent
    derived from the 0.44 and 0.87 μm channels, consistent with Ruiz-Arias et al.
    (2013). Only AERONET sites (Table 4) that were continuously in operation for at
    least 190 days between 2009 and 2011 were selected. Three AERONET sites outside
    California are included because they are expected to be more representative of
    the eastern part of California, where considerable utility-scale solar power plant
    development is occurring. 2.5. CIMIS, NREL and ISIS validation data The California
    Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) with 124 active weather stations
    is operated by the Department of Water Resources and has been operational since
    1982 (CIMIS, 2009a). Each CIMIS station is equipped with a Li-Cor LI200S photodiode
    pyranometer accurate to ±5% based on sensor specifications (CIMIS, 2009b) and
    GHI is reported as an hourly average of 60 samples within the hour. A CIMIS station
    maintenance visit is called for every three or four weeks during the warmer months
    of the year and every five or six weeks during the cooler months (CIMIS, 2015).
    During the maintenance visit, the CIMIS stations sensors are checked for operation
    and accuracy and cleaned or replaced as needed. Since CIMIS stations are not centrally
    maintained, data quality issues exist for individual stations and this motivated
    a careful additional quality control by the authors. CIMIS provides quality control
    based on data averages, standard deviations, theoretical limits, and other procedures
    described by Meek and Hatfield (1994) and Eching and Moellenberndt (1998) and
    suspicious data is flagged and was removed for the analysis in this paper. Since
    this quality control is not sufficient to detect small measurement biases, Luoma
    and Kleissl (2012) visually examined data from each CIMIS station individually
    and excluded all questionable data. This manual quality control yielded 65 sites
    with higher quality data (Jamaly et al., 2012). However, post-processing corrections
    for air mass, temperature and spectral effects are not applied here (Geuder et
    al., 2009, Geuder et al., 2008, King and Myers, 1997, Vignola, 2006). Moreover,
    the GHI from the clear sky models is also compared with presumably more accurate
    ground measured GHI from the Integrated Surface Irradiance Study (ISIS, Hicks
    et al., 1996) site in Hanford and several National Renewable Energy Laboratory
    (NREL) supported sites shown in Table 3. ISIS uses Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometers
    and a Normal Incidence Pyrheliometer to measure GHI and DNI directly and report
    it as 3 min averages. ISIS also provides the quality control flag following each
    measurement: a zero flag indicates a valid data point that passed all quality
    control checks; a flag greater than zero indicates that data failed at least one
    level of quality control. The NREL sites gather 1 minute DNI and GHI and instruments
    are listed in Table 3. The NREL sites do not contain flags, but the data was visually
    examined for outliers by comparing irradiance on clear days against the REST2
    + Calibrated MODIS clear sky model and found to be consistent. Since soiling is
    a particular concern for DNI measurements, the station environment were verified
    to be far away from large sources of soiling (highways, agricultural) and no evidence
    of rapid soiling was found in the clear sky data comparison. Maintenance records
    were requested for all sites and the records for Humboldt State University (HSU),
    Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), Loyola Marymount University (LMU),
    University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and ISIS Hanford show frequent maintenance
    visits during the period of interest. Table 3. Geographical information on GHI
    and DNI validation sites: 4 NREL sites and 1 ISIS site in Hanford (last row).

    over high albedo sites and should be calibrated before application. AOD and PW

    indicates the AERONET site elevation above mean sea level (MSL), the average elevation
    of MODIS L3 pixel and MACC grid point elevation. The year column indicates what
    AERONET time period is used to calibrate MODIS data (ground measured GHI will
    be compared against the clear sky models for the same time period later). The
    MODIS latitude and longitude are for the center of the MODIS pixel containing

    US are generally small with annual means smaller than 0.1 and will affect GHI
    only by less than 5% (Ruiz-Arias et al., 2013). The inland sites tend to have
    smaller AODs with the exception of Fresno that may be impacted by agricultural
    activity. Overall we observe a significant correlation between MODIS and AERONET
    (0.39–0.73), but MODIS is usually biased large consistent with Ruiz-Arias et al.
    (2013) and (Levy et al., 2010), which may be attributed to the misrepresentation
    of the land surface and/or assumed aerosol properties in the algorithm (Levy et
    al., 2010). Especially, at the inland AERONET stations (e.g. at Goldstone, Fig.
    3) MODIS AOD is up to 7 times larger than AERONET AOD. MODIS AOD biases are generally
    large with the exception of a few coastal sites (e.g. CalTech, Trinidad Head and
    UCSB). Clearly, uncalibrated MODIS AOD is not a suitable input to solar resource
    models. However, due to the significant correlation a linear regression fit could
    remove much of the errors while retaining information on the day-to-day variability
    in AOD. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Comparison of AOD at 0.55
    μm from MODIS and AERONET at Goldstone (Table 4, Table 5) in 2011. Each datapoint
    represents one day, where AERONET data is averaged over ±30 min around the Terra
    overpass time. Data for days with clouds within ±30 min of the Terra overpass
    time were removed. There is no quality assured AERONET level 2.0 AOD from Goldstone
    after Oct 13, 2011. Similarly, MACC AOD is biased large by 128%, on average, which
    is not surprising since MODIS AOD is assimilated into MACC. Our results are consistent
    with Benedictow et al. (2014) who performed evaluation of the MACC reanalysis
    AOD against AERONET level 2.0 AOD for 2003–2012. Their Fig. 3.5.2 illustrates
    high biases in several years (2003–2012) in western, central and northern North
    America. Although the average correlation between MACC and AERONET is only 0.34,
    higher correlations are expected in other parts of the world. 3.2. Validation
    of MODIS L3 daily and MACC reanalysis 3 hourly PW Table 6 compares the MODIS L3
    and MACC reanalysis PW against the 11 AERONET sites. MODIS overestimates at all
    sites, but the largest errors and relative errors come from the coastal sites
    (Fig. 4) with rMBEs greater than 30%, presumably due to a large part of the respective
    MODIS pixels covering the ocean. MACC PW is more accurate than MODIS PW in terms
    of average MBE and MAE. Overall, the correlation coefficients are mostly larger
    than 0.8, so both MODIS and MACC PW are well correlated with AERONET PW. The PW
    and AOD analysis demonstrates that the MODIS products are valuable inputs to clear
    sky solar resource models if bias and most of the MAE are removed through calibration
    against ground data. Table 6. Comparison of MODIS L3 and MACC reanalysis PW against

    diversity of climates which varies from Mediterranean to subarctic. For building
    energy modeling, California is typically divided into 16 Climate Zones (Pacific
    Gas and Electric Company, 2006). We assume that the California Climate Zones are
    representative of atmospheric conditions including PW and AOD. Therefore when
    applying MODIS calibrations, rather than using the nearest AERONET site, the climate
    zones are used to match MODIS calibrations from the 11 AERONET sites to the 49
    MODIS L3 pixels in California (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 a linear regression
    is applied to the AOD and PW data from MODIS versus AERONET in Table 5, Table
    6. One regression is obtained per MODIS pixel using the AERONET sites assigned
    in Table 7 and the regression is then applied to the MODIS data across the entire
    year. Also, the MACC reanalysis AOD and PW could be calibrated in a similar way
    as MODIS products. Table 7. Climate zone, MODIS pixels and corresponding AERONET

    DNI outputs of the following clear sky models were compared with GHI and DNI from
    ground measurements at the Terra overpass time: (a) REST2 with (i) calibrated
    MODIS, (ii) uncalibrated MODIS, and (iii) MACC reanalysis. (b) Ineichen with (i)
    derived TL from uncalibrated and calibrated MODIS L3 data, (ii) monthly climatological
    Linke turbidity from the SoDa database, and (iii) derived TL from MACC reanalysis
    data. (c) 1 min timeseries of McClear irradiation (integral of solar irradiance
    over a time period with units of W h/m2) are downloaded and converted to irradiance
    (has units W/m2) for comparison. Fig. 1 shows a flowchart of all permutations
    of input data and clear sky models. The CIMIS station closest to the center of
    the MODIS pixel or the MACC grid point is used for validation. Since the clear
    sky models provide GHI in clear conditions, data in cloudy conditions within ±30
    min of the Terra overpass time (1000–1100 PST) are removed by retaining only data
    with a CIMIS clear sky index for the hourly interval of larger than 0.9 and smaller
    than 1.1. The clear sky index is calculated using clear sky GHI from the Ineichen
    model (Ineichen, 2008b) with Linke Turbidity monthly climatological averages from
    the SoDa Service (8) Outliers in the data meeting the average clear sky index
    criteria were removed if they differed by more than three standard deviations
    from the annual average GHI. Since the NREL and ISIS sites report 1 min and 3
    min, respectively, GHI and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) an algorithm that
    also considers temporal standard deviations in clear sky index is applied to select
    clear periods (Long and Ackerman, 2000). GHI comparisons result in large correlations
    due to the underlying annual and daily cycle of solar angles. Therefore, Gueymard
    (2012c) used the relative difference between annual average GHI and long-term
    average GHI to define an annual GHI anomaly. Similarly, to test the day-to-day
    variability caused by differences in atmospheric composition, the GHI anomaly
    ΔGHI is here calculated by subtracting the 15 day moving average (only using clear
    days within a 15 day period at the Terra overpass time) from the GHI at Terra
    overpass time on the each day of interest (Eq. (9)). (9) where t is the Terra
    overpass time on the day of interest and i is the clear sky Terra overpass time
    on one of the days within the 15 day period. For DNI, REST2 and McClear are compared
    against 4 NREL and 1 ISIS site for 2009–2011 and Eq. (9) is also applied to calculate
    DNI anomalies ΔDNI. Quality control was conducted by (i) eliminating DNI smaller
    than 100 W m−2 (since only clear conditions were of interest), (ii) eliminating
    flagged (Section 2.5) ISIS measurements, and (iii) applying a triplet stability
    criterion by requiring that 3 subsequent measurements (for NREL 1 min averages
    and for ISIS 3 min averages) vary by less than 3%, (iv) eliminating values that
    differed by more than three standard deviations from the mean, and (v) visually
    detecting and removing outliers in graphs of the fraction of direct horizontal
    to GHI. 5. Validation 5.1. Global horizontal irradiance Fig. 5a shows a typical
    timeseries of CIMIS, REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS, and Ineichen + SoDa predicted
    GHI. By design the climatological Ineichen + SoDa model does not capture the day-to-day
    GHI variability, while the REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS predicted GHI captures the
    range of CIMIS daily variability reasonably well except for when the MODIS AOD
    is biased significantly. For reference, non-anomaly GHI results for relatively
    higher quality and better maintained NREL and ISIS stations are compared in Table
    A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3 (Appendix A). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Timeseries of CIMIS measured, REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS predicted and Ineichen
    + SoDa predicted GHI (a) and GHI anomaly (b) for uncalibrated MODIS AOD at 0.55
    μm and PW at MODIS pixel #11 and CIMIS station 170 in coastal northern California
    in 2009. Days with clouds within the ±30 min of the Terra overpass time were removed.
    5.2. Global horizontal irradiance anomaly We now focus on anomaly results which
    removes effects of the diurnal cycle resulting in smaller but more relevant correlation
    coefficients and error metrics (Table 8.1, Table 8.2 and Figs. 5b, 7, 8). Anomaly
    errors better illustrate model performance as they are independent of long-term
    measurement biases or erroneous low frequency signals in the sensor data, e.g.
    from soiling. Given that rMBE of anomalies is negligible by design, the rMBE comparison
    is not included in Table 8.1, Table 8.2. The rMAE comparison in Table 8.1 shows
    that the REST2 and Ineichen models with calibrated MODIS exhibit the smallest
    average relative rMAEs of 1.56% and 1.58% respectively, and Ineichen + uncalibrated
    MODIS produces the largest error. Since AODs in the California are generally small
    (Table 4) clear sky GHI is more sensitive to absorption by PW, which explains
    why REST2 and Ineichen with calibrated MODIS have smaller rMAEs than those of
    REST2 and Ineichen with uncalibrated MODIS. Ineichen + SoDa, the only model with
    monthly climatological input data, shows smaller rMAE than Ineichen + uncalibrated
    MODIS, but also the lowest correlation (Table 8.2) since the day-to-day variability
    and deviations from the climatology are not considered. Comparing REST2 and Ineichen
    with the same input data, REST2 outperforms the rMAE of Ineichen. Table 8.1. rMAE
    of REST2 (columns 5, 6, and 11), Ineichen (columns 7–9, and 12) and McClear (column
    10) predicted GHI anomalies against CIMIS, NREL and ISIS measured GHI anomalies.
    Anomalies were calculated by subtracting 15 day moving averages (Eq. (9)). The
    other columns are (1) the MODIS pixel number, (2) the CIMIS station ID (rows 2–28)
    and names of NREL (rows 29–32) and ISIS sites (row 33), (3) the AERONET site that
    was used to calibrate MODIS AOD and PW, and (4) the distance (km) between the
    center of the MODIS pixel and the ground station. Further, “cal_” means that MODIS
    data was “calibrated” (Section 3). All errors are relative errors normalized by
    annual average ground measured GHI. # ID AERONET Distance (km) REST2 + MODIS Ineichen

    + indicate AERONET sites. Number in boxes is the MODIS pixel number. Since REST2
    with calibrated MODIS achieves the smallest rMAE, we proceed to evaluate the impact
    of MODIS calibration on the results. Fig. 6 compares REST2 predicted GHI anomaly
    for uncalibrated and calibrated MODIS AOD and PW. Similarly, for most other MODIS
    pixels, the erroneous enhancement of AOD and PW causes the REST2 + uncalibrated
    MODIS predicted GHI anomaly to have a larger variance than the measured GHI anomaly.
    Calibration moves the GHI anomaly data close to the 1:1 line resulting in a large
    reduction in mean absolute errors (on average 27%, Table 8.1) and a small improvement
    in correlation coefficients (from 0.50 to 0.53, on average, Table 8.2). For Ineichen,
    the calibration of MODIS data reduces rMAE by almost 31% and increases the correlation
    coefficients by 10%, on average. Fig. 7, Fig. 8, which spatially display the error
    metrics of GHI from Table 8.1, Table 8.2 for uncalibrated and calibrated MODIS
    input data, confirm that calibration of AOD and PW reduces rMAEs and increases
    correlation coefficients, but spatial patterns or other determinants of errors
    did not emerge from this analysis. 5.3. Direct normal irradiance anomaly While
    Ineichen is a clear sky model for GHI only, for McClear DNI can be calculated
    using the GHI and clear sky diffuse irradiance. Fig. 9 and Table 9 compare ISIS
    and NREL measurements against REST2 predicted DNI anomaly for uncalibrated and
    calibrated MODIS input data. Calibration reduces rMAE of the DNI anomaly by 45%,
    on average (Table 9). The non-anomaly DNI results are compared in Table A-4, Table
    A-5 (Appendix A). While REST2 + calibrated MODIS outperforms the other models,
    the REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS, McClear and REST2 + MACC show nearly the same
    overall performance, which indicates that the results are most sensitive to the
    quality of the input data. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Comparison

    predicting GHI and DNI The GHI and DNI anomaly errors may come from a variety
    of sources. In Section 3 we showed that there are errors in MODIS daily AOD and
    PW when compared to AERONET. The linear calibration of MODIS AOD and PW significantly
    improved the GHI and DNI anomaly errors, but random MODIS errors remain that are
    caused by spatial heterogeneity in AOD and PW fields over the 100 × 100 km MODIS
    L3 pixels, random errors in MODIS measurements, and assumptions in the postprocessing
    algorithms. In addition the MODIS Angstrom exponent fails to provide quantitative
    information about aerosol size over land (Levy et al., 2010). Other error sources
    are the assumption of REST2 inputs other than aerosols and water, such as ground
    albedo, total ozone abundance, total nitrogen dioxide abundance and aerosol single
    scattering albedo for both REST2 bands (Table 1). For example, ground albedo exhibits
    spatial and temporal variability due to land use change and rain or snow. Especially,
    the appearance of snow during winter time in the areas of three CIMIS stations
    (43, 57 and 183) leads to sudden and large changes in ground albedo. Fig. 10a
    shows the timeseries of directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) and bi-hemispherical
    reflectance (BHR) for solar spectrum shortwave (SW, 0.4-3 μm) for CIMIS station
    #57. Note that the blue-sky (actual) albedo is the interpolation between BHR and
    DHR using He et al. (2012). (10) where αblue, αws and αbs are the blue-sky, black-sky
    and white-sky albedo, and fdif is the portion of diffuse illumination, which is
    a function of optical depth, solar zenith angle, aerosol type, and band. Over
    the albedo range encountered at snowy sites (0.1–0.9), REST2 GHI varies close
    to linearly and by about 7% for CIMIS station #57 for Angstrom turbidity coefficient,
    Angstrom Exponent, PW, surface pressure and SZA of 0.03, 0.629, 0.75 cm, 880 mb
    and 67°, respectively (Fig. 10b). Albedo changes during the remainder of the season
    (0.1–0.3) only causes less than 1% change in REST2 GHI. Therefore, we suggest
    that measured albedo should be used for snowy sites, while the default albedo
    is sufficiently accurate for other sites where snow is not observed and albedo
    changes are more gradual and of smaller amplitude. Download : Download full-size

    was calculated relative to the reference GHI with albedo equals 0.2. 7. Comparison
    of non-anomaly error metrics against the literature The present study needs to
    be placed in the context of prior applications of REST2 and other clear sky models.
    Utilizing local ground measured data for all REST2 inputs (the best, albeit rare
    scenario) Gueymard (2008) tested the performance of REST2 predictions of GHI and
    DNI using a set of 30 individual measurements obtained at the Southern Great Plain
    (SGP) site of Billings, Oklahoma, USA. MBE and RMSE of GHI were 0% and 0.6% respectively,
    and MBE and RMSE of DNI were 0.3% and 0.8%. Gueymard (2010) validated five models
    to predict clear sky DNI with high quality datasets including aerosol and water
    vapor measurements by sun photometers as inputs against high quality measured
    clear-sky irradiance data. Under such ideal conditions, the REST2, METSTAT and
    Ineichen clear sky models achieved accuracy comparable to that of a first-class
    pyrheliometer (maximum rRMSE for DNI are 2.0%, 5.6% and 4.7% respectively). Rizwan
    et al. (2010) used the REST2 model with precipitable water calculated from measured
    relative humidity and atmospheric temperature to estimate the solar resource at
    four stations in India and the maximum REST2 rRMSE for GHI was 3.4%. In this paper,
    the error metrics of both GHI and DNI in Table A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3, Table
    A-4, Table A-5 (Appendix A) are larger than previously published results, because
    satellite-derived inputs to REST2 are much less accurate. Other investigators
    who used satellite derived inputs include Lefèvre et al. (2013), who validated
    McClear irradiances with MODIS and MACC as inputs against 1 min measurements under
    clear sky conditions at Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations in
    various climates. For GHI, the bias was between −6 and 25 W m−2, and RMSE ranged
    between 20 W m−2 (3% of the mean GHI) and 36 W m−2 (5%). The DNI bias ranged between
    −48 and 33 W m−2 and RMSE ranged between 33 W m−2 (5%) and 64 W m−2 (10%). The
    tables in Appendix A presents accuracies consistent with those of Lefèvre et al.
    (2013). Ruiz-Arias et al. (2013) found that MODIS L3 AOD is of sufficient quality
    to produce accurate enough GHI at the regional scale introducing an uncertainty
    of approximately 15% in DNI and less than 5% for GHI (for AOD smaller than 0.5).
    Comparing Table 8.1, Table 8.2 with 9 shows that relative error of DNI anomaly
    is generally larger than that of GHI anomaly, consistent with the findings by
    Ruiz et al. (2013). 8. Conclusions MODIS L3 daily AOD and PW were compared against
    AERONET ground measurements in California. Large biases were observed especially
    in AOD that were removed using a linear regression against AERONET observations
    in a similar climate zone. Validation against ground stations demonstrated that
    bias and random errors of REST2 GHI and DNI prediction are improved when calibrated
    MODIS L3 data is input to REST2. The improvements were quantified using the GHI
    and DNI anomalies thereby removing the issue of the always high correlation due
    to annual and daily cycle of solar angles. The daily REST2 + calibrated MODIS
    product also favorably compared against the anomaly obtained from the (a) REST2
    with MACC reanalysis data, (b) Ineichen model with (i) uncalibrated MODIS L3 data,
    (ii) the monthly climatological SoDa database for Linke turbidity, and (iii) MACC
    reanalysis data, as well as (c) McClear. The Ineichen + calibrated MODIS achieved
    similar accuracy to REST2 + calibrated MODIS, which indicates that the quality
    of the input data is a larger differentiator than the clear sky model. Our new
    operationalizable REST2 + calibrated MODIS product can improve the accuracy of
    satellite-based clear sky solar resource assessment and forecasting to an average
    rMBE of 1.5% and rMAE of anomalies of 1.6%. Since most semi-empirical satellite
    models require clear sky irradiance as a baseline and in California clear sky
    differences can contribute substantially to bias errors in satellite models (Jamaly
    et al., 2012), solar resources can be assessed more accurately and economically
    over a large region. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank (i) the

    provides validation data for the REST2 GHI and DNI before running means are removed
    to obtain anomalies. Comparison against CIMIS data shows generally positive bias
    errors, which may be an artifact of insufficient maintenance such as soiling (Geuder
    and Quaschning, 2006, Mejia and Kleissl, 2013) of the CIMIS stations that results
    in underestimating solar irradiance by a few percent. Given the less rigorous
    quality of CIMIS data, the results are more questionable and not provided. Table
    A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3 (Table A-4, Table A-5) validate the GHI (DNI) from REST2
    against NREL and ISIS measured GHI (DNI). rMBE in Table A-1 shows that with uncalibrated
    MODIS data, the REST2 and Ineichen underestimate GHI for four out of six stations.
    The general decrease in the GHI errors after calibration of MODIS data is consistent
    with the fact that MODIS usually overestimates AOD compared to AERONET. Since
    calibration decreases MODIS AOD the REST2 predicted GHI increases compared to
    NREL and ISIS measured GHI decreasing errors. On the other hand, for the SMUD
    station, where rMBE of REST2 + MODIS and Ineichen + MODIS is positive, GHI rMBE
    and rMAE also decrease after MODIS calibration, probably because Fresno is the
    only AERONET site where MODIS underestimated PW compared to AERONET. Since the
    decrease in GHI related to calibration of MODIS PW dominates over the increase
    related to calibrated MODIS AOD, GHI errors decrease for SMUD. For the same reason,
    GHI errors increase for the ISIS station Hanford which originally has negative
    GHI rMBE. Table A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3 demonstrate that Ineichen + calibrated
    MODIS predict GHI most accurately, REST2 + calibrated MODIS is slightly less accurate,
    and Ineichen + uncalibrated MODIS is of the lowest accuracy as measured by GHI
    rMAE. REST2 + MACC is shown to have the best performance excluding the REST2 and
    Ineichen + calibrated MODIS, indicating that better quality PW data is more critical
    than AOD in modeling clear sky GHI in California given that transmission of clear
    sky GHI is more determined by PW than generally small AOD. Table A-1. rMBE of

    and MACC data are also investigated as alternative inputs. All errors are relative
    errors normalized by the annual average GHI for each ground station. # ID AERONET

    Table A-4, Table A-5 compare the REST2 predicted DNI with NREL and ISIS DNI. Uncalibrated
    DNI is underestimated significantly for LMU and UNLV compared to the other 3 sites
    possibly due to the relatively large positive bias in uncalibrated AOD from the
    MODIS pixels near Goldstone (Table 5) and uncalibrated PW from MODIS pixels near
    UCSB (Table 6). DNI is much more sensitive to AOD than GHI. Similar to the GHI

    ground stations need to be well maintained to provide accurate data, several data
    quality checks were conducted. Soiling can cause overestimation by clear sky models.
    While soiling typically occurs slowly and is automatically corrected through the
    anomaly method, fast soiling has the potential to affect anomalies. Google Earth
    was used to determine whether surface cover near the site would have potential
    for fast soiling. The NPCS site is located at the Nevada Power Clark Station which
    creates potential for soiling from air pollution. Hanford is situated in an agriculture
    area which creates potential for soiling. The other sites were not found to be
    near sources of fast soiling. Since maintenance records were lacking at NPCS and
    either high AOD days or soiling days occurred around July 1st, the NPCS station
    was excluded in the paper. Further, maintenance records were examined. Afshin
    Andreas, Senior Scientist at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), provided
    point of contacts for all NREL associated sites. The site hosts who responded
    provided the following records: LMU: Jeremy Pal, Associate Professor at Department
    of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science, Loyola Marymount University, indicated
    that the data before May 2012 was reliable. Based on the LMU maintenance record,
    maintenance was performed at least once a month in 2011. Fig. B-1f confirms that
    the data appear to be of high quality as observation and model data follow the
    same trend. Download : Download full-size image Fig. B-1. Timeseries of NREL measured

    j) MODIS pixel #46 and UNLV station. UNLV: Aaron Sahm, Research Engineer at University
    of Nevada at Las Vegas, provided a cleaning log that documents cleaning at least
    four times a month in 2011. The model data also captured the observed data very
    well. Hanford: John Augustine, scientist at NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory
    Global Monitoring Division, mentioned that the local hosts at the National Weather
    Service clean the instruments on a weekly basis and did quasi-annual site visits
    to exchange instruments with freshly calibrated units, clean the equipment, and
    conduct preventative maintenance by replacing equipment regularly. For example,
    ventilator fans, data loggers are replaced on a three-year cycle. Fig. B-1, Fig.
    B-2 show DNI and GHI timeseries at 10:30 on every clear day in 2011. Overall,
    there is no obvious fast soiling event or maintenance issues observed for the
    five stations (HSU, SMUD, LMU, UNLV and Hanford) above in 2011. Download : Download

    Get rights and content Highlights • SMAP strongly agreed with the temporal dynamics
    of in-situ observations. • All remotely sensed soil moisture products were sound
    over moderately vegetated areas. • Over densely vegetated areas, ASCAT performed
    better than the other products. • The maximized R method was utilized to show
    the importance of individual datasets. • The SMAP-ASCAT combination performed
    better than the other combined products. Abstract Global-scale surface soil moisture
    (SSM) products retrieved from active and passive microwave remote sensing provide
    an effective method for monitoring near-real-time SSM content with nearly daily
    temporal resolution. In the present study, we first inter-compared global-scale
    error patterns and combined the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Advanced
    Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SSM
    products using a triple collocation (TC) analysis and the maximized Pearson correlation
    coefficient (R) method from April 2015 to December 2016. The Global Land Data
    Assimilation System (GLDAS) and global in situ observations were utilized to investigate
    and to compare the quality of satellite-based SSM products. The average R-values
    of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 were 0.74, 0.64, and 0.65 when they compared with in
    situ networks, respectively. The ubRMSD values were (0.0411, 0.0625, and 0.0708)
    m3 m− 3; and the bias values were (− 0.0460, 0.0010, and 0.0418) m3 m− 3 for SMAP,
    ASCAT, and AMSR2, respectively. The highest average R-values from SMAP against
    the in situ results are very encouraging; only SMAP showed higher R-values than
    GLDAS in several in situ networks with low ubRMSD (0.0438 m3 m− 3). Overall, SMAP
    showed a dry bias (− 0.0460 m3 m− 3) and AMSR2 had a wet bias (0.0418 m3 m− 3);
    while ASCAT showed the least bias (0.0010 m3 m− 3) among all the products. Each
    product was evaluated using TC metrics with respect to the different ranges of
    vegetation optical depth (VOD). Under vegetation scarce conditions (VOD < 0.10),
    such as desert and semi-desert regions, all products have difficulty obtaining
    SSM information. In regions with moderately vegetated areas (0.10 < VOD < 0.40),
    SMAP showed the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Over highly vegetated regions (VOD
    > 0.40) ASCAT showed comparatively better performance than did the other products.
    Using the maximized R method, SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 products were combined one
    by one using the GLDAS dataset for reference SSM values. When the satellite products
    were combined, R-values of the combined products were improved or degraded depending
    on the VOD ranges produced, when compared with the results from the original products
    alone. The results of this study provide an overview of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2
    reliability and the performance of their combined products on a global scale.
    This study is the first to show the advantages of the recently available SMAP
    dataset for effective merging of different satellite products and of their application
    to various hydro-meteorological problems. Previous article in issue Next article

    collocation error estimatorCombining datasets 1. Introduction Several methods
    for reproducing near-surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates from satellite-based
    microwave instruments have been proposed (Wagner et al., 1999, Njoku et al., 2003,
    Entekhabi et al., 2010, Jackson et al., 2010, Kerr et al., 2010). These investigations
    are crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle because SSM plays a key role
    in the partitioning of energy and water fluxes among the hydrosphere, biosphere,
    and atmosphere. In particular, SSM at global and regional scales is required in
    operational applications such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) at different
    time scale, climate and agricultural modeling, water resource and irrigation management,
    dust outbreak prediction, and many other surface processes (Koster et al., 2009,
    Brocca et al., 2010, Bolten et al., 2010, Kim and Choi, 2015, Kim et al., 2017,
    Brocca et al., 2017). Owing to its important role in the climate system, SSM was
    listed as a key variable among the “Essential Climate Variables” (ECVs) in 2010
    (GCOS, 2006). Several satellite missions including the Soil Moisture and Ocean
    Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) have been dedicated to
    measuring global SSM through space-borne remote sensing (Kerr et al., 2001, Entekhabi
    et al., 2010). Specifically, SMAP was recently launched by the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) in January 2015 to monitor SSM and to detect the
    frozen or thawed state of soils. Similarly, many other promising sensors (active
    and passive) capable of acquiring global SSM have been launched. These include
    the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard MetOp-A and B, the Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard Global Change Observations Mission 1-Water
    (GCOM-W1), and the Microwave Radiation Imager onboard Feng Yun (Albergel et al.,
    2009, Dorigo et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013, Parinussa et al., 2015, Cui et
    al., 2016). Although the SSM retrieved from these sensors has a coarse spatial
    resolution (20–50 km), they have a short repeat time (1–3 days) that is suitable
    for many hydro-meteorological applications (Walker and Houser, 2004). In addition
    to improved retrieval of satellite-based SSM-data from space, new land surface
    models and ground measurements are providing useful SSM information about near-surface
    to deeper layers. Ground-based SSM measurements reflect the true value of SSM
    at point scale (Brocca et al., 2007, Famiglietti et al., 1999, Ngunyen et al.,
    2017). Moreover, many previous studies have shown that point-based ground measurements
    can reflect temporal SSM dynamics of the field mean SSM value (Vachaud et al.,
    1985, Wagner et al., 2008, Brocca et al., 2009); therefore, such ground measurements
    are essential for validation and evaluation of both satellite-based and land surface
    model SSM products. In situ datasets have limitations in terms of vertical and
    spatial representation and spatial extent, especially for global-scale data analysis.
    For this reason, modeled SSM products such as those from the Modern-Era Retrospective
    Analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-Land) and Global Land Data
    Assimilation System (GLDAS), which are based on merged satellite and gauge-based
    datasets, are sometimes used for validation and calibration studies (Brocca et
    al., 2011, Chen et al., 2013, Al-Yaari et al., 2014a, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b).
    Not only satellite-based SSM data but also land surface models are tools that
    provide sufficiently reasonable guidance of SSM and profile SM information worldwide
    over regions where in situ observations are sparse (Lakshmi, 2004, Albergel et
    al., 2012). Understanding the spatio-temporal error characteristics of different
    satellite SSM products is of great importance for operational applications. In
    many previous studies, the consistency of satellite-based SSM products have been
    investigated using reference SSM values, including data from the Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), SMOS, ASCAT, and AMSR2. Such studies have
    shown that each product has different error characteristics under different surface
    and environmental conditions (Dorigo et al., 2010, Gruhier et al., 2010, Kim et
    al., 2015a, Konings et al., 2011, Leroux et al., 2014, Wagner et al., 2014, Griesfeller
    et al., 2016, Burgin et al., 2017, Cho et al., 2017). Because each satellite-based
    SSM product has shown different performance depending upon land cover conditions,
    sensor specifications, and SSM retrieval algorithms, the merging of these different
    datasets is regarded as a promising approach by which to establish a level of
    meta-performance superior to what is possible using the individual products (Liu
    et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2015b). Combining different satellite-based
    SSM products provides a mechanism for overcoming the drawbacks of an individual
    product (Houser et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2012, Wagner et al., 2012, Dorigo et
    al., 2015). To generate a combined SSM product, both passive and active microwave
    SSM datasets have been used. Liu et al. (2012) combined four passive and two active
    microwave products as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Program on Global
    Monitoring of ECV, which was initiated in 2010 and is known as the Climate Change
    Initiative (CCI; http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org). Starting from 1 November
    1978, the ECV CCI products have provided combined SSM products for long observation
    periods and preserved the relative dynamics of the original satellite-derived
    products (Dorigo et al., 2017). Furthermore, Kim et al. (2015b) introduced a method
    of combining two different parent datasets by maximizing the temporal correlation
    with a reference dataset. If the reference value (e.g., a modeled SSM dataset)
    is assumed to be the highest-quality SSM dataset, the maximized R method is capable
    of improving the temporal correlation coefficient values between the combined
    and reference datasets when two parent products are combined. Because each product
    performs differently under different environmental conditions, complementary aspects
    can be distinctly observed. However, the reference values do not always represent
    the highest-quality dataset, which can lead to deterioration of the parent products.
    Nonetheless, in many cases, the combined dataset shows generally superior results
    compared with individual datasets by showing higher values of temporal correlation
    with ground-based measurements. In the present study, we first inter-compared
    and combined a recently available SMAP dataset with specific versions of ASCAT
    and AMSR2 SSM products using statistical metrics including triple collocation
    analysis and presented the results through the Taylor diagram. As previously mentioned,
    SSM is retrieved using many different algorithms that can show better or worse
    performance over some areas even though the observational system is identical.
    Wagner et al. (2014) clearly showed that different performance rankings of SSM
    datasets (and subsequent conclusions) could be obtained by specific selection
    of processing and interpretation of the datasets. Considering this point, the
    present study compares algorithms and metrics to determine whether a particular
    satellite-based SSM product enables improved quality and performance when combined
    with other datasets. The three main objectives of this study were as follows.
    First, we aimed to assess the global performance of individual SSM products (from
    SMAP, ASCAT, and ASMR2) by comparison with ground-based and model SM datasets
    produced from April 2015 to December 2016. Second, we aimed to investigate global-scale
    error patterns of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 using triple collocation analysis; with
    performance assessments to consider different land cover classifications and vegetation
    fractions. Third, we aimed to combine SMAP with other satellite-based SSM products
    and evaluate the results to investigate practical applications of the newly available
    SMAP dataset. Regarding the combined SSM product, the SMAP SSM was considered
    a candidate product for combination with others. This research provides novel
    insight into the use of the recently available SMAP SSM dataset in various practical
    applications including satellite-based SSM data merging, assimilation in NWP,
    and hydrological modeling. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Remotely sensed surface
    soil moisture SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 were evaluated against GLDAS and in situ
    SSM datasets, which were assumed to be reference SSM values. Because the SMAP
    dataset was made available in April 2015, the period of analysis was April 2015
    to December 2016. All three satellite-based SSM datasets were projected to the
    WGS84 geographic grid and resampled using the nearest neighbor distance algorithm
    to establish a uniform georeferenced 0.25° grid, which is the same as that used
    in the GLDAS datasets (Rüdiger et al., 2009, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b). In addition,
    the GLDAS datasets were reconstructed from UTC time-based to local time-based
    in order to match the SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 local overpass times. This reconstruction
    was achieved by considering the navigational time zone based on longitude and
    by neglecting local statutory deviations (Fig. S1). Similarly, data from the in
    situ datasets were extracted at a time closest to the local overpass time of each
    satellite product. Because the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) provides
    hourly data, we set a one-hour threshold for the maximum time difference between
    the in situ and satellite overpass time (local time). For instance, we used the
    in situ datasets of 06:00–07:00 A.M. for the half orbit SMAP, 9:00–10:00 P.M.
    for the descending path of ASCAT, and 01:00–02:00 A.M. for the ascending path
    of AMSR2. In order to calculate sound results, the in situ stations for which
    the corresponding pixels had > 100 data points in time were selected for all satellites
    and GLDAS products. 2.1.1. SMAP soil moisture retrievals Successfully launched
    in January 2015, the SMAP mission is the first Earth observation satellite developed
    by NASA in response to the National Research Council''s Earth Science Decadal
    Survey (Entekhabi et al., 2010, Colliander et al., 2017). This mission was designed
    to enhance scientific understanding of the interaction between the Earth''s surface
    and atmosphere to predict natural disasters and improve climate forecasting. The
    main goal of the SMAP mission is to obtain high-accuracy SSM information. The
    accuracy requirements of SMAP mission specify that SSM should be retrieved with
    ubRMSE of 0.04 m3 m− 3 accuracy in low or moderately vegetated areas in order
    to use this data for effective monitoring and prediction of natural hazards such
    as droughts, floods, and dust outbreaks. SMAP carries an L-band radiometer (1.41
    GHz) and rotating reflector radar (1.26 GHz non-imaging SAR), which was designed
    to provide a conical scanning-antenna beam. SMAP has a near-polar sun synchronous
    orbit and overpasses the Equator at approximately 06:00 and 18:00 local time (LT)
    in descending and ascending orbits, respectively. In addition, SMAP was expected
    to provide different SSM resolutions, at 3, 9, and 36 km. However, only the 36
    km and enhanced L3 radiometer 9 km resolution datasets are currently available
    because the radar unit failed to transmit after 7 July 2015. For this reason,
    only a few months of the active/passive combined SSM datasets are available. The
    data from the descending half-orbit has been used as input for SSM retrievals
    because of the equilibrium assumption of early morning thermal conditions for
    hydro-meteorological variables (e.g., air, vegetation, and near-surface soil).
    In this study, we used the 36 km half-orbit descending SMAP Level-3 radiometer-based
    SSM product because it is expected that the descending overpass time of SMAP (06:00
    LT) is closest to thermal equilibrium and uniformity among the SSM conditions
    available at this time (Hornbuckle and England, 2005, Entekhabi et al., 2010,
    Das and Dunbar, 2015). It is this product (SMAP Level-3) that is hereafter referred
    to as SMAP. All radiometer data products from SMAP were obtained from the National
    Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC DAAC, http://nsidc.org/data/smap/). The SMAP dataset
    was masked where soil temperature was below 273.15 K from the GLDAS 0–10 cm layer,
    for SSM lower than 0.02 m3 m− 3 and higher than 0.50 m3 m− 3, and when the flag
    for the freeze/thaw fraction indicated an unfrozen soil and when the retrieval
    quality flag was set as ‘recommended’. The validation grid processing corresponds
    to the SMAP data version R14010. Please refer to O''Neill et al. (2015) for detailed
    description of the algorithm theoretical basis document for the SMAP. 2.1.2. ASCAT
    soil moisture retrievals The ASCAT sensors onboard the Meteorological Operational
    A and B (MetOp-A and MetOp-B) satellites are active microwave remote-sensing instruments
    operated by the European organization for the exploitation of METeorological SATellites
    (EUMETSAT). METOP-A was launched in October 2006. ASCAT acquires radar backscatter
    measurements at a frequency of 5.3 GHz (C-band), has a spatial resolution of 25
    km with a 1–3 day revisit time (Scipal et al., 2008a, Naeimi et al., 2012, Wagner
    et al., 2013). The ASCAT overpasses at 09:30 LT in descending orbit, and at 21:30
    LT in ascending orbit. ASCAT SSM retrievals are distributed by the EUMETSAT''S
    Satellite Application Facility as Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management
    (H-SAF). The change-detection method was introduced by Wagner et al. (1999) and
    improved by Naeimi et al. (2009). Specifically, the SSM content (ms), or the so-called
    degree of saturation, can be calculated from the basic ASCAT measurement, which
    is the backscattering coefficient (σ°) measured at a reference angle of 40° and
    based on the method of Wagner et al. (1999). For details about the change detection
    algorithm, please refer to Wagner et al. (2013). The porosity values were estimated
    by applying the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006). The texture characteristics
    were obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-CAS/JRC,
    2009). In this study, we focused on ASCAT SSM products for a 25 km-swath grid
    generated from the EUMETSAT Data Service Centre, which are available for download
    through the EUMETSAT website (https://rs.geo.tuwien.ac.at/products/). The ASCAT
    dataset was masked out to remove grid cells for wetland fractions above 15%, topographic
    complexity above 20%, SSM error above 10%, and soil temperature below the freezing
    point (Draper et al., 2012, Parrens et al., 2012, Paulik et al., 2014). It is
    worth noting that all three products have different flag information for masking
    abnormal SSM datasets; thus, if new flag information is developed in future datasets,
    it would help provide masks for retrieval of higher quality SSM datasets. In addition,
    different ASCAT SSM products, such as the time series products distributed by
    H-SAF (http://www.geo.tuwien.ac.at), may show better quality than the NRT data
    found in the EUMETSAT archive. However, owing to the availability of the dataset,
    we used EUMETSAT NRT products in this study. We considered only the descending
    path of the ASCAT SSM product, hereafter referred to as ASCAT, because it showed
    slightly better statistical metrics when compared with in situ observations (Table
    S1). 2.1.3. AMSR2 soil moisture retrievals The AMSR2 sensor onboard the GCOM-W1
    platform was launched in May 2012 (Kachi et al., 2013). This satellite mission
    is the successor of Aqua AMSR-E, which ceased operation in October 2011. AMSR2
    is a passive microwave remote sensing instrument developed by the Japan Aerospace
    Exploration Agency (JAXA) with the cooperation of NASA. It utilizes microwave
    frequency bands: C1 (6.9 GHz), C2 (7.3 GHz), and X (10.6 GHz), for SSM measurements
    and provides a 1450 km swath-width. It has three different ground resolutions
    that depend on frequency channels (C1-band: 24 × 42 km, C2-band: 34 × 58 km; X-band:
    35 × 62 km) with a revisit time of one to two days (Maeda and Taniguchi, 2013).
    The AMSR2 crosses the equator at 01:30 LT and 13:30 LT in descending and ascending
    orbits, respectively. AMSR2-based SSM products can be derived from two widely
    used algorithms: the JAXA and Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) (Maeda and
    Taniguchi, 2013a, Kim et al., 2015a, Parinussa et al., 2016, van der Schalie et
    al., 2017). Both algorithms utilize a simple radiative transfer model (Mo et al.,
    1982) based on microwave emissions from the land surface, which were measured
    in terms of satellite brightness temperature (Tb). The JAXA algorithm produces
    SSM products in the X-band only, whereas the LPRM products are available in both
    C- and X-band microwave frequencies. Moreover, the LPRM algorithm retrieves the
    vegetation optical depth (VOD) product along with the SSM product from AMSR2 Tb
    measurements using the Microwave Polarization Difference Index (Owe et al., 2001,
    Meesters et al., 2005). VOD is a measure of vegetation water content and aboveground
    vegetation structure, and has been used for estimates of aboveground vegetation
    (Konings and Gentine, 2017). In this study, we used the AMSR2 descending overpass
    VOD to evaluate the different satellite SSM products in terms of vegetation fraction.
    Furthermore, for this study we used the most recently improved LPRM AMSR2 dataset
    (descending path), hereafter referred to as AMSR2. This dataset has shown significantly
    improved ability, relative to existing LPRM algorithms, for capturing the temporal
    variability of SSM when compared with in situ observations (Parinussa et al.,
    2016, van der Schalie et al., 2017). Moreover, in comparison with other satellite-based
    SSM datasets, AMSR2 can provide SSM and VOD retrieval at three different frequencies.
    Therefore, it can minimize the effects of contamination from radio frequency interference
    (RFI), which means that the C1-, C2-, and X-bands can be used for selective SSM
    and VOD retrieval (de Nijs et al., 2015). The C-band frequency is usually expected
    to have higher-quality SSM information than with the X-band because of the deeper
    penetration provided by lower frequencies. Therefore, we used the newly developed
    RFI detection method, the standard error of estimate (SE) proposed by de Nijs
    et al. (2015), to set the lower frequency-based SSM product as a priority product
    for AMSR2 (Fig. S2). We note that care in the use of LPRM AMSR2 products distributed
    by JAXA is encouraged because Cho et al. (2017) found that Version 1 LPRM AMSR2
    C1- and C2-band retrieved SSM showed unusual temporal patterns when compared with
    the modeled and X-band SSM products. The AMSR2 dataset over densely vegetated
    regions was screened using the VOD value and setting an upper threshold of 0.6,
    which was retrieved along with the SSM values (Meesters et al., 2005, Owe et al.,
    2008) (Fig. 1a). Similar to the SMAP and ASCAT dataset preprocessing, when the
    soil temperature was below 273.15 K (freezing point of water), the AMSR2 dataset
    was masked out. Download : Download high-res image (558KB) Download : Download

    from the BATS model based on six VOD ranges. 2.2. GLDAS soil moisture product
    Along with the satellite-based SSM datasets, Global Land Data Assimilation System-1
    (GLDAS-1) Noah, which became available in 2000, also provides numerous atmospheric
    and land surface variables with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution
    of 0.25°. The model is constrained to using heterogeneous forcing datasets including
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/GDAS atmospheric analysis,
    the spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged
    Analysis of Precipitation field, and observation-based radiation fields derived
    from the Air Force Weather Agency''s Agricultural Meteorological modeling system
    (Rodell et al., 2004). GLDAS has been widely used as a reference dataset for merging
    active and passive products (Liu et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2015b). In this study,
    the SSM of the top 10 cm layer from GLDAS-1-Noah, hereafter referred to as GLDAS,
    was utilized as the reference value of SSM when combining satellite-based SSM
    products based on the maximized R method. In addition, it is worth noting that
    some depth mismatch between the satellite-based SSM (top few cm) and the GLDAS
    SSM (10 cm) is certainly expected; however, GLDAS-1 Noah SSM represents 0–10 cm
    depth, which implies that the GLDAS SM contains information about depths shallower
    than 10 cm as well. Moreover, in many previous studies, the top 10 cm SM-dataset
    from land surface models was utilized to validate and improve various satellite-based
    SSM retrievals (Dorigo et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2012, Wagner et al., 2012). GLDAS
    SSM was validated with in situ SSM datasets from the ISMN to verify its reliability,
    as discussed in Section 3.1. 2.3. International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) To
    evaluate the individual remotely sensed SSM products, we used in situ observations
    from the ISMN. ISMN is a web-based data center that collects and organizes in
    situ soil moisture measurements from different operational networks and validation
    campaigns, and freely shares the data with users through a web interface (https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/;
    accessed on 4. Oct. 2017). The soil moisture data provided by ISMN are crucial
    for validating different satellite-based SSM retrievals and land surface models
    and for studying the climate system (Dorigo et al., 2011, Dorigo et al., 2013,
    Ochsner et al., 2013). The ISMN soil moisture has been widely used in many validation
    studies. Currently, the ISMN holds numerous soil moisture datasets provided by
    > 2000 measurement stations and operated by > 55 different networks (Dorigo et
    al., 2015). In this study, however, we chose only stations measuring SM at a depth
    of 10 cm or less with data covering the study period (April 2015 to December 2016).
    Moreover, to obtain robust statistical results, we masked the stations for which
    the corresponding pixel had < 100 data points in time (for GLDAS and the three
    satellite products). Furthermore, if more than one station was situated in a grid
    pixel, we took an average of all station values. After this preprocessing step,
    the data at 213 sites in eight different monitoring networks remained, most of
    which are located in the United States and Europe (Fig. 2). All datasets were
    quality controlled, and were cross-screened in order to retain only overpass times
    and pixels for which all satellite-based datasets were attainable. A brief description
    of the ISMN used is summarized in Table 1. A detailed description of the ISMN
    used is provided in the Supplementary Data file. Download : Download high-res

    Transfer Model (BATS) is a simple boundary layer scheme first introduced by Dickinson
    (1986). Subsequent improvements in the model have been well documented by Dickinson
    (1984) and Dickinson et al. (1993). The BATS scheme considers three soil layers
    and one vegetation layer for predicting seven variables: canopy temperature, surface
    soil temperature, subsurface soil temperature, surface soil water, root zone soil
    water, total soil water, and canopy water content. The surface cover and soil
    types are based on Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985). This scheme was designed
    for incorporation into the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community
    Climate Model; however, its many features have also been used in other land surface
    models (Liang et al., 1994). In this study, land cover classifications from the
    BATS model were used to evaluate the performance of the individual and combined
    SSM products for different land cover types. 2.5. Data preparation Satellite-based
    SSM retrieval from space provides observations of the thin top-layer SSM; however,
    in situ soil moisture sensors are installed at a certain depth below the surface
    and can sense the soil moisture profile. Therefore, a depth discrepancy occurs
    between satellite and in situ sensors that has been noted and widely discussed
    in previous studies (Al-Yaari et al., 2014a, Dorigo et al., 2015, Shellito et
    al., 2016, Zohaib et al., 2017). Simple techniques like the exponential filter
    make it possible to overcome the depth discrepancy between ground measurements
    and satellite SSM products by estimating root-zone soil moisture, as proposed
    by Wagner et al. (1999). In their study, this semi-empirical approach generally
    improved the R-values with respect to in situ measurements. We calculated the
    satellite profile layer soil moisture using an exponential filter developed by
    Wagner et al. (1999) and given by Albergel et al. (2008) in its recursive form
    as follows: (1) where SWIm(n-1) is the profile soil moisture estimate at tn-1,
    and ms(tn) is the SSM estimate at tn. The gain K at a time tn is given by. (2)
    where T represents the characteristic time length in days, which is considered
    a proxy for all processes that affect the temporal dynamics of subsurface soil
    moisture such as layer depth, soil hydraulic properties, evapotranspiration, runoff,
    and vertical heterogeneity of the soil properties (Albergel et al., 2008). In
    previous studies, an optimum T (Topt) value approach was proposed based on the
    Nash-Sutcliffe score, to match the profile soil moisture at each in situ station.
    The exponential filter has been detailed in various studies (Wagner et al., 1999,
    Albergel et al., 2008, Ford et al., 2014). In the present study, we also used
    Topt to match the depth of satellite and in situ soil moisture at each station.
    SWI was only considered when satellite-based SSM datasets were compared with in
    situ observations. 2.6. Statistic metrics used for the comparison and combination
    methodology 2.6.1. Comparison metrics and triple collocation error estimator We
    considered three conventional statistical indicators to evaluate each remotely
    sensed SSM (SSMSAT): the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), bias, and unbiased
    root-mean-square deviation (ubRMSD). These metrics were considered for validation
    of three satellite and model datasets against in situ observations, and for validating
    the combination of three satellite products. We assumed that in situ datasets
    have the highest quality SSM values in order to calculate the unbiased RMSD and
    bias values. In addition, we set the GLDAS datasets as the highest-quality reference
    SSM values for combining two parent products, which is an inevitable assumption
    for combining processes via the maximized R method. All conventional statistical
    metrics were applied only when the number of data points used for calculation
    was larger than 100. The ubRMSD metric was considered to investigate each product''s
    RMSD value after removing a possible bias from ancillary information (e.g., porosity)
    (Albergel et al., 2012, Al-Yaari et al., 2014a, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b). Only
    the R-values at p < 0.05 were considered in the comparison analysis. In order
    to provide global-scale analysis of the satellite-based SSM products, we considered
    triple collocation (TC) statistics. TC analysis enables evaluation of global-scale
    satellite-based SSM products without having additional reference datasets as conventional
    metrics. Through TC analysis, we could calculate the random error variances of
    three collocated datasets. Most recently, Gruber et al. (2016) suggested the use
    of decibel units of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR[dB], Eqs. (3), (4), which is physically
    intuitive and has low sensitivity to estimation uncertainties. In addition, on
    the basis of the SNR value, the fractional mean squared error (fMSE, Eq. (5))
    and linear correlation coefficient (Ri2, Eq. (6)) of the individual datasets could
    be calculated. Details of the TC analysis have been presented in previous research
    (Scipal et al., 2008b, Draper et al., 2013, Su et al., 2014a, Su et al., 2014b,
    Gruber et al., 2016). TC assumes independent errors; therefore, we selected SSM
    products with derivations as different as possible because similarly derived datasets
    might have partially correlated errors. This might happen for AMSR2 and SMAP,
    for example, because they are both radiometers. For these reasons, we repeated
    the TC calculations twice: once with a triplet including SMAP, ASCAT, and GLDAS
    and once with a triplet including AMSR2, ASCAT, and GLDAS. Then we used the ASCAT
    TC statistics from the SMAP triplet because ASCAT is more dissimilar in frequency
    to SMAP than AMSR2. However, the error estimates for each product were consistent
    when using the two different triplets, we expect that this process did not impact
    the final results discussed later. Aside from the value of error variance, the
    SNR metric enables objective comparison of the error metric among various satellite
    SSM products (Gruber et al., 2016) because the individual SSMSAT has a subjective
    scaling of the range of SSM variation. (3) where the subscript 1 and 2 denotes
    two independent satellite dataset, cov is the covariance of the two independent
    satellites dataset or a satellite and GLDAS dataset, and var. is variance of the
    SAT1 error. By taking SNR with the decadic logarithm, the SNR was distributed
    symmetrically around zero, which gave easier and clearer insight into the value
    of SNR interpretation. (4) Every positive or negative 3 dB interval of SNR[dB]
    indicates an additional doubling or halving of the ratio of two different SNR[dB]
    values. The fMSE for dataset i can be calculated using Eq. (5) and is inversely
    related to the SNR value (Draper et al., 2013). (5) The scale of fMSE is between
    ‘0’ and ‘1’. A lower/higher fMSE indicates a clearer/noisier signal of the SSM
    value. Thus, when the fMSE is ‘0’, its SSM observation does not include noise.
    Here, an fMSE of ‘1’ means there is only noise in its SSM observation. If the
    fMSE value is lower than 0.5, its SSM observation signal is stronger than its
    noise. The Ri2 value can be calculated from following equation: (6) The Ri2 is
    different with conventional R-values in terms of its independency (McColl et al.,
    2014). Ri2 does not require a reference dataset as a conventional R value, which
    can degrade the value of R owing to random errors in the reference dataset. Details
    of the TC statistics described above are presented in Gruber et al. (2016). In
    addition, because Ri2 does not provide a more distinctive perspective than SNR[dB],
    we focused on the SNR and fMSE results. 2.6.2. Taylor diagrams A Taylor diagram
    can represent multiple statistics for comparison of different SSMSAT against the
    SSMREF (e.g., in situ) data on two-dimensional plots. Normalized standard deviation
    (SDV) indicates the ratio between the SSMSAT and in situ measurement standard
    deviations. In the Taylor diagram, the SDV values are shown as radial distance,
    R-values (Eq. (5)) with in situ data are shown as an angle in the polar plot,
    and the in situ observation is shown as a point on the x-axis at R = 1 and SDV
    = 1. The centered RMSD (E) between SSMSAT and the in situ dataset, which was normalized
    using the in situ standard deviations, is the distance to this point. E quantifies
    errors in the pattern variations, whereas SDV provides the relative amplitude
    and does not include information on bias (Albergel et al., 2012). SDV and E are
    computed using Eqs. (7), (8), respectively. (7) (8) The E value can be calculated
    from SDV and R (Eq. (9)) because they are complementary but not independent (Taylor,
    2001). (9) 2.6.3. Maximized R method for combining soil moisture datasets One
    of the main goals of this research was to determine whether the SMAP product contributes
    to better performance of the combined datasets when it is considered as a candidate
    for combining with multiple SSM products. Combinations of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2
    were considered for the final blended product. SMAP and ASCAT, hereafter referred
    to as SMAP + ASCAT; AMSR2 and SMAP, hereafter referred to as AMSR2 + SMAP; and
    ASCAT and AMSR2, hereafter referred to as ASCAT + AMSR2, were combined using the
    maximized R method. As mentioned in Section 1, the maximized R method is capable
    of improving the temporal R-values between combined and reference datasets if
    the reference value is well chosen. Kim et al. (2015b) suggested that the maximized
    R method can improve the temporal R-value of certain products with respect to
    reference values, and determined that the combined dataset is generally superior
    to those of the individual products. The combined SSM products were calculated
    by applying a weighting factor (w) with a constrained range of 0–1 as follows:
    (10) This combination process was only implemented for a given pixel when both
    parent products were available. Moreover, if the R-value of the combined product
    in a given location was less than the R-value of one of the parent products, then
    the parent product with the higher skill was used instead of the combined product.
    The R-value between SSMC and SSMREF can be expressed as a function of w: (11)
    where μ is the mean of the combined and reference value of SSM (SMC and SMREF),
    and σ is the standard deviation of the combined and reference value of SSM (SMC
    and SMREF). To combine two different SSM products (i.e., SSM1 and SSM2) from Eq.
    (10), the systematic differences between the reference SSM and each parent product
    (i.e., SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2) should be removed. Draper et al. (2009) suggested
    that the normalization of each product against a reference dataset (accomplished
    using Eq. (12)), could be used to remove systematic differences: (12) where SSMNOR
    is the normalized SSM against the reference product. After normalization, Eq.
    (11) was differentiated with respect to w to determine the value of w that optimizes
    the maximum R-value between SSMC and SSMREF. Finally, we obtained w using (13)
    where Rx·y is the correlation coefficient between the two products. In addition,
    a numerical method was utilized to maximize R if either parent product showed
    a negative R-value. In order to find the maximum of a constrained non-linear function,
    we used the MATLAB function fmincon (http://au.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html).
    By setting the constraints (0 ≤ w ≤ 1) and the objective function (Eq. (11)),
    the weight factors could be optimized numerically. In total, 157,710 pixels were
    combined and numerical calculations occurred 5150, 12,798, and 2548 times for
    the SMAP + ASCAT, ASCAT + AMSR2, and AMSR2 + SMAP combinations, respectively.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Comparison with in situ observations The results
    of the statistical metrics for the comparison of GLDAS SSM, SMAP, ASCAT, AMSR2,
    and in situ SSM are shown in Table 2 for the period from 2015 to 2016. The average
    R-values for all networks were 0.73, 0.74, 0.64, and 0.65 for GLDAS, SMAP, ASCAT,
    and AMSR2, respectively. The average ubRMSD values were (0.0438, 0.0411, 0.0625,
    and 0.0708) m3 m− 3, and the average bias values were (0.0035 (0.03), − 0.0460
    (0.06), 0.0010 (0.04), and 0.0418 (0.06)) m3 m− 3 for GLDAS, SMAP, ASCAT, and
    AMSR2, respectively. The values in the parenthesis indicate the average absolute
    bias value. In terms of average R-value, GLDAS and SMAP showed better performance
    than the other products. The highest averaged R-value from SMAP compared with
    the in situ results were very encouraging; moreover, among all three satellite
    SSM products, only SMAP had a higher R-value than GLDAS in COSMOS (20 of 73),
    RSMN (17 of 19), SCAN (76 of 1018), SOLSCAPE (3 of 291), and USCRN (49 of 486)
    networks. In terms of the average ubRMSD, GLDAS and SMAP had the lowest values,
    with SMAP showing an overall dry bias. AMSR2 had the highest ubRMSD value and
    an overall wet bias. In addition, because we chose the GLDAS dataset to provide
    the reference values (which show low ubRMSD, bias, and absolute bias values against
    in situ observations), the ubRMSD and bias values in the combined products are
    expected to be greatly improved in relation to the in situ observations. However,
    many observations of R-values from GLDAS were similar to or less than those of
    SMAP; therefore, the R-value for the combination of SMAP with other products is
    expected to be barely improved; perhaps even decreased. Please find details in
    the discussion in Section 3.3. Table 2. Summary of statistical results comparing

    The in situ-based statistical results provide only limited regional satellite
    SSM performance and have scale mismatch issues. These limitations can be addressed
    by employing TC analysis. This enables inspection of global scale satellite-based
    SSM datasets. In this section, each product was compared using TC metrics. A simple
    sensitivity analysis was conducted in terms of different VOD ranges because vegetation
    is one of the most important parameters in the SSM retrieval algorithm (O''Neill
    et al., 2016). Furthermore, the results were interpreted using land classification
    datasets to provide the advantages and limitations of using certain satellite
    products for practical applications at global scale. 3.2.1. Global trends from
    TC statistics Fig. 3 shows global maps of three different TC metrics (SNR[dB],
    Ri2, and fMSE) for SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2. Similarly, in Fig. 4, the statistical
    performance of SNR[dB] for three satellite products was calculated and is ranked
    on the basis of higher value. Download : Download high-res image (697KB) Download

    The TC results (Fig. 3) indicate that all satellite products have limitations
    in retrieving SSM in northern Africa, the Middle East, northern Asia, regions
    of Central Australia, and the western USA; where most of the world''s large, bare
    deserts and arid regions are located. Most of these regions were classified as
    desert and semi-desert by the BATS model (Fig. 1), had a VOD value < 0.20, and
    showed a high average sand fraction value (49.35%). These regions are known for
    high systematic retrieval error because the soil is extremely dry, and microwave-based
    SSM retrieval systems suffer significant challenges in providing a reading (Dorigo
    et al., 2010). First, these challenges are associated with problems in estimating
    the thickness of the emitting layer and the effective temperature (Holmes et al.,
    2006). Microwave bands of lower frequency (i.e., L- or C1-bands) penetrate dry
    soils even deeper and signals from deeper layers; therefore, significant problems
    arise when SSM is retrieved not only from passive microwave band instruments but
    also from active microwave band instruments in arid and semi-arid environments
    (Ulaby et al., 2015, Escorihuela et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013). Also, arid
    regions have very little SSM variation and changes in the SSM signal are often
    too small to exceed the background noise of the instrument. This adds to difficulties
    in retrieving SSM information using microwave-frequency observations. However,
    in the present research, only 3211 of 33,850 pixels (9.5%) (total number of desert
    and semi-desert pixels) were available for investigation of these regions. This
    means that definitive results can only be obtained after getting more and larger
    datasets to study in the future. Fig. 5a shows that ASCAT had the lowest number
    of the best SNR[dB] pixels in these areas, as indicated by the negative SNR[dB]
    (see the x-axis VOD range of 0.00–0.20). This is a well-known active sensor issue:
    they appear to be more sensitive to sub-surface heterogeneities or surface roughness
    (Wagner et al., 2003, Gruhier et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013). Wagner et al.
    (2013) also indicated that over some desert areas, passive SSM products are recommended
    for use, particularly over regions for which the value of VOD is ~ 0.00–0.20,
    and the average desert and semi-desert areas account for 82.5% of the land surface
    (Figs. 1 and S3). Download : Download high-res image (376KB) Download : Download

    interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is
    referred to the web version of this article.) For the VOD range between 0.00 and
    0.10, the TC statistics for SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 are shown in Fig. 5b (SNR[dB]:
    1.57, − 1.48 and 0.66), Fig. 5c (Ri2: 0.56, 0.45, and 0.53), and Fig. 5d (fMSE:
    0.44, 0.55, and 0.47). All products showed high fMSE in these regions. Over an
    extremely dry surface, an active sensor can produce a wet bias from the unpredictable
    volume scattering from deeper soil layers or scattering from subsurface heterogeneity;
    as a result, erroneously higher SSM retrievals can be produced. This is supported
    by previous research indicating that the amount of backscatter decreased when
    the soil became slightly wet over desert or semi-arid environments (Wagner et
    al., 2013). Moreover, the dielectric property of quartz, which is significant
    given the very high sand fractions in desert and semi-desert regions (see Figs.
    1 and S4), can hamper retrieval of SSM by passive satellites (Pan et al., 2016).
    However, the passive-based datasets showed slightly better performance than did
    the ASCAT dataset for arid regions. This is apparent in the result of fMSE in
    Fig. 5d. The average value of the fMSE of ASCAT was > 0.5 and showed only negative
    SNR[dB] among all products. This indicates that the ASCAT SSM observations for
    such regions have higher noise variance than that of the observed SSM signals.
    As VOD increased from a sparsely vegetated value (0.00 < VOD < 0.20) to a moderately
    vegetated value (0.20 < VOD < 0.40), where crop and mixed farming, and tall and
    short grass are the major surface covers (Fig. 1c), the average SNR[dB] values
    for ASCAT and SMAP remarkably increased, whereas those for AMSR2 notably decreased
    after VOD exceeded 0.20. Over the moderately vegetated areas, SMAP had the highest
    SNR[dB], at 5.16–7.38 (red bars in Fig. 5b). Over more vegetated regions (0.40
    < VOD < 0.60), where > 76% of the area was covered by trees (Fig. 1c), ASCAT had
    the best SNR[dB] (green bars in Fig. 5). These results imply that ASCAT has better
    ability to reproduce accurate temporal patterns of the SSM than those of passive-based
    satellite products over densely vegetated areas. Moreover, the apparent contrast
    of fMSE between active and passive products are shown in the red boxes in Fig.
    3(g)–(i). One of the reasons for this result is that active microwave sensors
    are known to be less sensitive to surface temperature effects than passive sensors.
    This is a known characteristic of the instrument; thus, the active sensor can
    show better performance over widely varying temperature regions. Therefore, ASCAT
    showed less susceptibility to diurnal surface temperature variation over densely
    vegetated areas. Our results were consistent with the findings in several previous
    studies (Scipal et al., 2008b, Dorigo et al., 2010, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b). However,
    considering alternative technologies, the passive microwave SSM retrievals could
    be improved if the effective temperature estimates were parameterized (Parinussa
    et al., 2011). When two passive products were compared, SMAP showed better results
    in the statistical metrics for almost all the vegetation ranges. Over densely
    vegetated regions, the average SNR[dB] from SMAP decreased from 7.38 to 3.17 (red
    bars in Fig. 5b), and the SNR[dB] from AMSR2 remained < 3 (blue bars in Fig. 5b).
    This difference is likely attributable to the operating band. The C- and X-band
    frequencies of the passive sensors can easily be attenuated by vegetation, which
    makes their measurements relatively insensitive to SSM variability. The lower
    frequency band of SMAP (i.e., L-band) penetrates vegetation better than the AMSR2
    high-frequency bands (i.e., C1-, C2-, and X-bands). Furthermore, during the early
    morning, both the near-surface temperature change and Faraday rotation effects
    were at their minimum (Kerr et al., 2001). These conditions aid in the retrieval
    of SMAP SSM from the passive microwave radiometer at the 06:00 LT overpass time
    (Le Vine and Abraham, 2000, Jackson et al., 2010). In addition, it is noteworthy
    that areas with VOD values of > 0.6 had SSM datasets masked out, meaning that
    SSM retrieval from dense forests, such as those of the Amazon and Southeast Asia,
    remains impossible. When the fMSE values were carefully investigated, as Fig.
    5d shows, it became clear that the AMSR2 product should be carefully reviewed
    before using it for practical applications in densely vegetated areas (VOD > 0.50),
    as was also apparent from the negative SNR[dB] results in Fig. 5b (average fMSE
    value > 0.50). This indicates that AMSR2 SSM observations in these regions have
    higher noise variance than the observed SSM signal variance. 3.3. Evaluation of
    combined soil moisture products As discussed in Section 3.2, different products
    showed distinctive performance and error characteristics over land with different
    properties and in different climate zones. We assumed that the combination of
    different products would provide complementary abilities that could increase the
    R and lower the ubRMSD and bias values. To combine a pair of different SSM products,
    the maximized R approach was utilized (Section 2.6.3) using the GLDAS products
    as the reference data set. Table 3 shows the results of the statistical metrics
    for GLDAS (Table 3; first column), the original satellite SSM (Table 3; second
    column), and the combined product based on GLDAS (Table 3; third column) against
    the in situ observations. The datasets were separated into two parts: calibration
    dataset for 2015, and validation dataset for 2016, to achieve an independent validation
    process. Table 3. Statistical results comparing GLDAS, different satellite SSM,

    m3 m− 3. Except for the R-value results of SMAP, the R-values of combined product
    AMSR2 + ASCAT were improved when compared with the original products alone. This
    result can be explained by the performance of the reference dataset against in
    situ observations. Because many in situ observations in GLDAS had lower R-values
    than in SMAP, the computation of the weights was affected and resulted in calculation
    of sub-optimal weights. Therefore, the SMAP R-value rarely showed large improvement
    or even decreased, even after combination with other products. However, these
    points also imply that SMAP could be utilized to provide reference values to improve
    the temporal dynamics of GLDAS SSM datasets. In addition, because we chose a reference
    dataset with low ubRMSD (0.0411 m3 m− 3) and bias (0.0109 m3 m− 3) values against
    in situ observations, the ubRMSD and bias values in the combined products were
    greatly improved. Fig. 6 presents the box plots of R-values for the parents and
    combined products for six different VOD ranges worldwide. The red boxes represent
    the R-values of each original product, and the green and blue boxes indicate combined
    products. In Fig. 6a, the average R-values of SMAP consistently increased as the
    VOD ranges increased. When SMAP was combined with ASCAT (i.e., SMAP + ASCAT),
    increased average R-values for VOD ranges over 0.50 were observed in the combined
    product. However, for VOD ranges < 0.40, the R-value of SMAP products were hardly
    improved by the combination process because ASCAT and AMSR2 showed lower SNR[db]
    than did SMAP in these regions (Fig. 5). Considering the TC results, in which
    SMAP showed the best SNR[db] over the VOD range 0.00–0.40 and ASCAT showed the
    best SNR[db] over the VOD range 0.40–0.60, these results are natural consequences.

    for each VOD bin appears above each box plot. (For interpretation of the references
    to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) As shown in Fig. 6b, the R-values from ASCAT (red boxes) continuously
    increased as the VOD increased. When ASCAT was combined with SMAP (SMAP + ASCAT;
    green boxes in Fig. 6b) and AMSR2 (SMAP + AMSR2; blue boxes in Fig. 6b), the averaged
    values of R increased rapidly at VOD < 0.20. Moreover, SMAP + ASCAT slightly increased
    as the VOD increased, before reaching 0.40. ASCAT + AMSR2 (blue boxes in Fig.
    6b) did not show improvement for VOD > 0.20 (green boxes in Fig. 6b). These results
    indicate that AMSR2 could be utilized to improve the performance of ASCAT over
    sparsely vegetated areas, and that SMAP is a good choice to improve ASCAT except
    over densely vegetated areas. These results are well explained by the SNR[db]
    results as well. As shown in Fig. 6c, the average R-value of AMSR2 (red boxes)
    increased for VOD < 0.30 (0.28–0.67); however, it decreased for VOD > 0.30. In
    particular, for VOD > 0.40; ASCAT + AMSR2 (blue boxes in Fig. 6c) compensated
    for the decreasing pattern in average R-value from AMSR2 better than AMSR2 + SMAP
    did (green boxes in Fig. 6c). These results suggest that for VOD > 0.40, ASCAT
    can be recommended as a strong candidate for combination with passive SSM retrieval.
    However, in the lower VOD range, AMSR2 is a relatively stronger contributor because
    it improves the temporal dynamics of both ASCAT and SMAP products (blue boxes
    in Fig. 6a and b). When ASCAT is considered for combination with passive satellite
    data over densely vegetated areas, it is better to choose a lower frequency (L-band)
    for SSM retrieval than a higher frequency. The L-band frequency offers the added
    advantage of being able to take measurements in conditions with denser vegetation
    than is possible with the C- or X-bands (green boxes versus blue boxes in Fig.
    6b). The results above emphasize that utilizing a variety of SSM datasets has
    great potential for remedying the shortcomings of individual products in challenging
    surface regions. Box plots of the ubRMSD and bias are included in Figs. S5 and
    S6. Because the ubRMSD and bias values were calibrated using a normalization approach,
    the combined products had ubRMSD values around 0.04 (m3 m− 3) and bias values
    around 0.01 (m3 m− 3). Fig. 7 presents two Taylor diagrams, illustrating the statistical
    comparison of the original and the combined products against in situ observations
    from each ISMN in 2016. The temporal variability in the original products is demonstrated
    by the SDV value results. In Fig. 7(a), the SDV values of the original SMAP, ASCAT,
    and AMSR2 products, represented by red, green, and blue symbols in the figure,
    are scattered widely in the SDV range 0.4–2.3. In Fig. 7(b), the SDV values of
    the combined SMAP + ASCAT, AMSR2 + SMAP, and ASCAT + AMSR2 products, represented
    by red, green, and blue symbols in the figure, are gathered near the SDV range
    1; straight lines with red, green, and blue colors indicate the average R-values
    for each product. The SDV value is the ratio between the SMSAT and SMIN SITU standard
    deviations. This statistic indicates that the variability from ground observation
    is lower than that of the original and combined products if the SDV is < 1, and
    vice versa. Moreover, the combined product SDV values are more tightly clustered
    than the original SDV values; most values are close to ‘1’. This means that for
    the products showing temporal variation similar to that of the in situ observations,
    the combined reproduced lower bias SSM information than the other original products.
    As we discussed in Section 3.3, the maximized R method highly depends on the performance
    of the reference values with in situ observations. We utilized the GLDAS datasets
    that showed better R-values than ASCAT and AMSR2 datasets, but similar or smaller
    R-values than SMAP datasets. However, the GLDAS datasets showed better results
    of ubRMSD and a higher absolute bias than all three products against in situ observations
    (Table 3). For these reasons, ASCAT and AMSR2 could be improved by SMAP at all
    sites (straight lines in Fig. 7). Unsurprisingly, the R-value of SMAP hardly improved
    because SMAP showed a better performance against in situ observations than the
    reference value. However, ubRMSD and bias highly improved because ubRMSD and bias
    of the reference datasets were closer to zero compared to in situ observations
    (SDV values in Fig. 7). These results emphasize that SMAP can be utilized as a
    reference value for combining the two different datasets to improve the temporal
    pattern of SSM for satellite-based datasets as well as the model SSM datasets.
    However, GLDAS datasets are recommended as the reference value to reduce the ubRMSD
    and bias value. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download

    the widely used (ASCAT and AMSR2), and a relatively new (SMAP), satellite-based
    SSM datasets from active and passive microwave sensors and combined them to evaluate
    the performance of each combined product. First, we compared ASCAT, AMSR2, and
    SMAP SSM retrievals using in situ observations from 213 stations worldwide. These
    products were evaluated considering the degree of vegetation and surface properties
    using TC statistics. Second, we combined these three products using the maximized
    R method, which can be used to maximize the temporal correlation coefficient of
    the combined products. The GLDAS dataset was used assuming that it had the highest
    data quality for use with the maximize R method. Finally, we evaluated the performances
    of the combined products, focusing on the SMAP for the combination process. The
    major findings of this study are given in the following points. 1. The validation
    results of all satellite-based SSM products and the GLDAS dataset compared with
    in situ observations showed that SMAP had the strongest agreements with the temporal
    dynamic of SSM. SMAP had an average R-value of 0.74 along with a low value of
    ubRMSD (0.0411 m3 m− 3) and dry bias (− 0.0460 m3 m− 3). In comparison, AMSR2
    had a wet bias on average (0.0418 m3 m− 3). ASCAT had the least bias and absolute
    bias (0.0010 m3 m− 3 and 0.04 m3 m− 3) among all the satellite products. In addition,
    AMSR2 had the highest ubRMSD among all products (0.0708 m3 m− 3), which suggests
    special care be taken in using the AMSR2 product for certain applications. 2.
    When all satellite products were investigated on the basis of TC statistics on
    a global scale, it was difficult to retrieve SSM from certain regions of northern
    Africa, the Middle East, northern Asia, Central Australia, and the western USA.
    These regions are mostly arid, with 82.5% of the land surface either desert or
    semi-desert. In particular, ASCAT showed only negative SNR[dB] and the highest
    fMSE among all products. 3. Over the moderately vegetated areas (VOD range 0.10–0.40),
    the average SNR[dB] of all products increased significantly compared to that over
    low- and high-vegetated areas. Although the SNR[dB] from ASCAT increased as the
    VOD increased, the SNR[dB] from SMAP decreased slightly, and the SNR[dB] from
    AMSR2 decreased more rapidly. Furthermore, when VOD < 0.40, SMAP had the best
    SNR[dB] among all products. 4. Over densely vegetated areas (VOD range 0.40–0.60),
    ASCAT showed higher SNR[dB] than other products. In contrast, AMSR2 showed only
    negative SNR[dB] and the highest fMSE among all products. 5. Over the highly vegetated
    regions (VOD > 0.50) ASCAT performed better, especially when combined with SMAP,
    which increased the temporal variability of the SSM. This indicates that SSM retrieved
    using an active microwave sensor has the potential to enhance passive microwave
    sensor products. In particular, the accuracy of temporal variability from SMAP
    + ASCAT tended to be better than that in other combined products. 6. SMAP showed
    good performance when combined with other products, which improved its accuracy
    in reproducing SSM temporal variability over the sparsely- and moderately-vegetated
    areas. This suggests that SMAP is a strong candidate for combination with several
    satellite-based SSM products except over the densely-vegetated regions. 7. The
    combined products from different satellite-based SSM datasets demonstrated the
    possibility of overcoming the limitations of individual products in challenging
    regions. Hence, this work contributes to the improvement of the application of
    satellite-based SSM in various fields such as NWP, agriculture and forest management,
    dust outbreaks, water resource and irrigation management, and many other surface
    processes. In the future, study of various correction methods such as cumulative
    distribution function matching, linear regression correction, and the time-varying
    weight approach will lead to better performance of the combined products. Also,
    we used the original version of the SMAP SSM dataset, and its SSM retrieval algorithms
    will be improved in the near future by field campaigns such as the SMAP Validation
    Experiment. Especially, different ASCAT SSM products such as the time series products
    distributed by H-SAF may show better quality than the NRT data found in the EUMETSAT
    archive. These datasets are expected to be significantly improved in the upcoming
    product release. Moreover, use of the improved datasets of the parent products
    provides potential for the combination products to be improved as well. All satellite
    products currently improve rapidly when spurred by positive competition; thus,
    the new mission, SMAP, has considerable potential for being complemented with
    existing satellite SSM products. In addition, many possibilities remain for improving
    AMSR2 SSM retrieval because the AMSR2 LPRM SSM products are expected to be much
    improved through enhanced versions before the final version was released. The
    updated and alternate choice for satellite-based SSM and re-analysis datasets
    can be utilized in future research to provide a better understanding of operational
    hydrological investigations and to improve combined active/passive satellite products.

    \ in the understanding of physical, chemical, and biological processes influencing\
    \ water quality, cou-\npled with improvements in the collection and analysis of\
    \ hydrologic data, provide opportunities for significant innovations \nin the\
    \ manner and level with which watershed-scale processes may be explored and modeled.\
    \ This paper provides a re-\nview of current trends in watershed modeling, including\
    \ use of stochastic-based methods, distributed versus lumped pa-\nrameter techniques,\
    \ influence of data resolution and scalar issues, and the utilization of artificial\
    \ intelligence (AI) as part \nof a data-driven approach to assist in watershed\
    \ modeling efforts. Important findings and observed trends from this work \ninclude\
    \ (i) use of AI techniques artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL),\
    \ and genetic algorithms (GA) to im-\nprove upon or replace traditional physically-based\
    \ techniques which tend to be computationally expensive; (ii) limitations \nin\
    \ scale-up of hydrological processes for watershed modeling; and (iii) the impacts\
    \ of data resolution on watershed model-\ning capabilities. In addition, detailed\
    \ discussions of individual watershed models and modeling systems with their fea-\n\
    tures, limitations, and example applications are presented to demonstrate the\
    \ wide variety of systems currently available \nfor watershed management at multiple\
    \ scales. A summary of these discussions is presented in tabular format for use\
    \ by \nwater resource managers and decision makers as a screening tool for selecting\
    \ a watershed model for a specific purpose.  \nKey Words: Watershed modeling,\
    \ water resources, hydrology, catchments. \nINTRODUCTION \nGlobal advances in\
    \ economies and standards of living \nhave resulted in a growing dependency on\
    \ water resources. \nMany societies have experienced water scarcity as a result\
    \ of \ncurrent patterns with societal advances; these are associated \nwith factors\
    \ such as population growth, increased urbaniza-\ntion and industrialization,\
    \ increased energy use, increased \nirrigation associated with advances in agriculture\
    \ productiv-\nity, desertification, global warming, and poor water quality \n\
    [1-4]. Improved understanding of how each of these factors \ninfluences water\
    \ supply, demand, and quality require im-\nproved abilities to understand underlying\
    \ processes and their \nimpact on water availability and use. This entails employing\
    \ \na holistic approach which integrates hydrologic processes at \nthe watershed\
    \ scale to determine an overall watershed re-\nsponse to both user demands and\
    \ changing climates [1]. Cen-\ntral to this effort, watershed modeling is being\
    \ utilized as a \ntool to better understand surface and subsurface water \nmovement\
    \ and the interactions between these water bodies. \nMore importantly, they offer\
    \ tools to guide decision making \non water resources, water quality, and related\
    \ hazard issues \n[2]. \nThis paper begins with a brief overview of the regulatory\
    \ \ncontext for the use of a watershed-based approach. An ex-\namination of various\
    \ watershed modeling methods, key \nprocesses involved, and new modeling techniques\
    \ are then  \n \n \n*Address correspondence to this author at the Vanderbilt University,\

    \ and the impact of data resolution and watershed \nscale on the modeling process.\

    \ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n2006 – 2011 Strategic Planmaintains\
    \ the five goals that were \ndescribed in the 2003 - 2008 Strategic Plan: (i)\

    \ of water infra-\nstructure, and improved quality of rivers, lakes, and streams.\
    \ \nThe new plan provides increased focus on achieving more \nmeasurable, environmentally-relevant\
    \ results, including use \nof a watershed-based perspective. Sub-Objective 2.2.1:\
    \ \nImprove Water Quality on a Watershed Basis, outlines \nUSEPA’s plan to “work\

    \ and others in three key areas: \nmaintaining strong core programs that emphasize\

    \ \nincreased regulations of Total Maximum Daily Loads \n(TMDLs) of the watershed-wide\
    \ pollutant influx to a water \nbody, typically referenced as non-point source\
    \ pollution, has \ncreated strong demand for new assessment tools that take \n\
    into consideration multiple sources of flow (e.g., overland \nflow) [4]. Several\
    \ watershed-scale models have been devel-\noped that provide assistance in predicting\
    \ non-point source \npollution. Borah and Bera [5] provide a detailed summary\
    \ of \nmany of these including the Agricultural Non-Point Source \nPollution Model\
    \ (AGNPS), Areal Non-Point Source Water-\nshed Environment Simulation (ANSWERS),\

    \ (HSPF), MIKE SHE, Soil \nand Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and others; therefore,\
    \ \nthey are only briefly considered in this review.  \nWATERSHED MODELING  \n\
    A watershed model simulates hydrologic processes in a \nmore holistic approach\
    \ compared to many other models \nwhich primarily focus on individual processes\
    \ or multiple \nprocesses at relatively small-or field-scale without full incor-\n\
    poration of a watershed area [6]. Watershed-scale modeling \nhas emerged as an\
    \ important scientific research and man-\nagement tool, particularly in efforts\
    \ to understand and con-\ntrol water pollution [7-11]. In the subsequent section,\
    \ differ-\nent types of watershed models are discussed along with sug-\ngested\
    \ applications. In addition, the role of artificial intelli-\ngence in assisting\
    \ in watershed modeling is discussed in \nsome detail. Genetic algorithms (GAs),\
    \ artificial neural net-\nworks (ANN), and fuzzy logic (FL) are currently being\
    \ em-\nployed to assist in processing data, develop improved rela-\ntionships\
    \ between hydrologic processes, and in some cases, \nassist in filling voids in\
    \ measured data. While much work \nhas been done to model individual hydrological\
    \ processes, \ncombining these processes at a much larger, watershed-scale \n\
    requires additional expertise and data resources. A short dis-\ncussion on the\
    \ difficulties encountered and some solutions \nused in scaling-up to the watershed\
    \ level is provided, includ-\ning discussions on data resolution, over parameterization,\
    \ \nand the impacts of digital elevation model (DEM) mesh size \non model accuracy.\
    \  \nModel Types \nWatershed models can be grouped into various categories \n\
    based upon the modelling approaches used. Melone et al. [7] \nnote the primary\
    \ features for distinguishing watershed-scale \nmodelling approaches include the\
    \ nature of the employed \nalgorithms (empirical, conceptual, or physically-based),\
    \ \nwhether a stochastic or deterministic approach is used for \nmodel input or\
    \ parameter specification, and whether the spa-\ntial representation is lumped\
    \ or distributed. Each of these \nfeatures is briefly outlined below in order\
    \ to provide context \nto subsequent watershed-scale modelling approaches. \n\
    Empirical models consist of functions used to approxi-\nmate or fit available\
    \ data. Such models span arange of com-\nplexity, from simple regression models\
    \ [8-10] to hydroin-\nformatics-based models which utilize Artificial Neural Net-\n\
    works (ANNs), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic, and other algorithms \n[11-19]. Additional\
    \ discussion on use of artificial intelli-\ngence in empirical watershed modelling\
    \ is provided in sub-\nsequent sections of this work. \nWatershed models can be\
    \ categorized as deterministic or \nstochastic depending on the techniques involved\
    \ in the mod-\nelling process. Deterministic models are mathematical mod-\nels\
    \ in which outcomes are obtained through known relation-\nships among states and\
    \ events. Stochastic models will have \nmost, if not all, of their inputs or parameters\
    \ represented by \nstatistical distributions which determine a range of outputs\
    \ \n[7]. Even though most models are deterministic in nature, \nstochastic models\
    \ provide two important advantages. First, \ntheir conceptually simple framework\
    \ makes it possible to \ndescribe heterogeneity when there are limited spatial\
    \ or tem-\nporal details. Second, they provide decision makers with the \nability\
    \ to determine uncertainty associated with predictions \n[7, 20-26].  \nWatershed-scale\
    \ models can further be categorized on a \nspatial basis as lumped, semi-distributed,\
    \ or distributed mod-\nels. The lumped modeling approach considers a watershed\
    \ as \na single unit for computations where the watershed parame-\nters and variables\
    \ are averaged over this unit. Compared to \nlumped models, semi-distributed and\
    \ distributed models ac-\ncount for the spatial variability of hydrologic processes,\
    \ in-\nput, boundary conditions, and watershed characteristics [4, \n27]. For\
    \ semi-distributed models, the aforementioned quanti-\nties are partially allowed\
    \ to vary in space by dividing the \nbasin into a number of smaller sub-basins\
    \ which in turn are \ntreated as a single unit [7, 28, 29]. Spatial heterogeneity\
    \ in \ndistributed models is represented with a resolution typically \ndefined\
    \ by the modeller [7]. Physically-based models are \nbased on the understanding\
    \ of the physics associated with the \nhydrological processes which control catchment\
    \ response \nand utilize physically based equations to describe these proc-\n\
    esses [30]. Examples of widely accepted physically based \nmodels on the market\
    \ include GSSHA [31, 32], HSPF, \nKINEROS2 [33], MIKE SHE [34], and SWAT [35,\
    \ 36]. \nDiscussion on the impacts of spatial data resolution and scal-\ning issues\
    \ in watershed modelling is provided later in this \ndocument. \nWatershed-scale\
    \ models can be further subdivided into \nevent-based or continuous-process models.\
    \ Event-based \nmodels simulate individual precipitation-runoff events with a\
    \ \nfocus on infiltration and surface runoff, while continuous-\nprocess models\
    \ explicitly account for all runoff components \nwhile considering soil moisture\
    \ redistribution between storm \nevents [7]. Further discussions of the aforementioned\
    \ classi-\nfication and watershed modeling approaches are presented in \nBorah\
    \ and Bera [5], Kalin and Hantush [37], Refsgaard [27], \nSingh and Frevert [38],\
    \ and Singh and Woolhiser [39]. \nAdvances inPhysically-based Models \nIn physically-based\
    \ models, mass transfer, momentum, \nand energy are simulated using partial differential\
    \ equations \nwhich are solved by various numerical methods such as the \nSt.\
    \ Venant equations [40] for surface flow, Richards [41] \nequation for unsaturated\
    \ zone flow, Penman-Monteith [42] \nequation for evapotranspiration and Boussinesq\
    \ equation for \nground water flow. Typically, the data and computation re-\n\
    quirements for these equations are enormous and demanding. \nFor example, the\
    \ traditional inversion methods using re-\npeated model runs are computationally\
    \ intensive and are not \n28    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \n\
    Daniel et al. \nappropriate for operational application for regional and \nglobal\
    \ data [43]. Significant effort has gone into addressing \nthese data and computational\
    \ issues.  \nIn a review of current projects in the United States, Re-\nstrepo\
    \ and Schaake [44] note that emphasis is being placed \non models with parameters\
    \ that can be derived from physical \nwatershed characteristics. However, it was\
    \ also noted that \npurely physically-based models may be unattainable or im-\n\
    practical, and, therefore, models resulting from a combina-\ntion of physically\
    \ and conceptually approached processes \nmay be required. Restrepo and Schaake\
    \ [44] further suggest \nthat the future needs and directions of research for\
    \ hydro-\nlogic modeling include: \n(1) Reliable modeling of the different sources\
    \ of uncer-\ntainty; \n(2) A more expeditious and cost-effective approach by \n\
    reducing the effort required in model calibration;  \n(3) Improvements in forecast\
    \ lead-time and accuracy;  \n(4) An approach for rapid adjustment of model parame-\n\
    ters to account for changes in the watershed, both \nrapid as the result from\
    \ forest fires or levee \nbreaches, and slow, as the result of watershed refor-\n\
    estation, reforestation or urban development; and  \n(5) An expanded suite of\
    \ products, including soil mois-\nture and temperature forecasts, and water quality\
    \ \nconstituents. \nRestrepo and Schaake [44] also emphasize the develop-\nment\
    \ of improved precipitation estimation techniques such as \nstatistical merging\
    \ of remote-sensor observations and fore-\ncasts from high-resolution numerical\
    \ prediction models. \nBeckers et al. [45] reviewed many of the widely used hydro-\n\
    logic models and suggest one key area for computational \nimprovement is the need\
    \ to better quantify climate change \nwhich include possible future shifts in\
    \ temperature and pre-\ncipitation, the occurrence of extreme events, and the\
    \ changes \nin glacier mass balances. Central to this research is under-\nstanding\
    \ how best to link hydrologic models to climate \nchange predictions which present\
    \ downscaling issues which \nare well documented by Wood et al., [46], Merritt\
    \ et al., [47] \nand Stahl et al., [48]. Climate change projections are gener-\n\
    ated from global-scale, general circulation models which are \ntoo coarse for\
    \ hydrologic models and some level of statistical \ndownscaling will be required\
    \ [49]. Four recent statistical \ndownscaling techniques that have been applied\
    \ with some \nsuccess in western North America include the delta method \n[50],\
    \ ClimateBC [51], Bias-correction statistical downscaling \n[52-54] and the Tree-GEN\
    \ method [48].  \nAn essential component of each physically-based model \nis the\
    \ availability of sufficient data to represent each of the \nmodeled processes.\
    \ Significant advances to improve data \ngeneration, preparation, and management\
    \ are being realized \nthrough the utilization of geospatial technologies such\
    \ as \ngeographic information system (GIS), global positioning \nsystems (GPS),\
    \ and remote sensing. Typical model prepara-\ntion tasks include the use of remotely\
    \ sensed images for ex-\ntraction of the terrain canopy data or the use of a digital\
    \ ter-\nrain model (DTM), or digital elevation model (DEM) data \nfor extraction\
    \ of hydrologic catchment properties, such as \nelevation matrix, flow direction\
    \ matrix, ranked elevation \nmatrix, and flow accumulation matrix. Notable GIS-based\
    \ \nextraction tools include MapWindowsTauDEM (Terrain \nAnalysis Using Digital\
    \ Elevation Models) [55], GIS Weasel \n(An Interface for the Development of Spatial\
    \ Parameters for \nPhysical Process Modeling) [56], and ArcHydro [57]. Recent\
    \ \nwork by Prodanovi\x03 et al. [58] utilized DEM-based GIS al-\ngorithms to\
    \ improve DEM data accuracy and usability. \nWhen digital data is employed for\
    \ hydrological modeling, \nthey offer the following data evaluation procedures\
    \ to im-\nprove accuracy and usability: (i) check the fraction of the \narea that\
    \ has the slope of 0%; (ii) use of the surface flow \nrouting tool (can be found\
    \ in most GIS packages) in order to \ncheck whether water will flow across the\
    \ whole study area if \narbitrary source point is selected; (iii) check of the\
    \ orienta-\ntion and interconnection of the stream network; and (iv) use \nof\
    \ streams as “cut-outs” across the DEM and check whether \nthe slope of a longitudinal\
    \ section toward the lowest, exit \nnode, is continuous. \nIn many instances,\
    \ limited or no data is available for \nstudied watersheds. GIS automated tools\
    \ based on geostatis-\ntics interpolation techniques (e.g., inverse distance weight-\n\
    ing, splines, and kriging) offer improved options for generat-\ning new DEMs datasets\
    \ from point and contour datasets. \nRecent studies (e.g., Flipo et al., [59];\
    \ Frei, et al., [60], San-\ntini, et al., [61]) continue to improve these techniques.\
    \ Flipo \net al., [59] demonstrated kriging provides a satisfactory rep-\nresentation\
    \ of aquifer nitrate contamination from local ob-\nservations to set initial conditions\
    \ for the physically-based \nmodel. It was further noted that the use of geostatistics\
    \ and \nphysically-based modeling allows assessment of nitrate con-\ncentrations\
    \ in aquifer systems. Frei et al., [60] also utilized \nthe same method in a parallel\
    \ physically-based surface–\nsubsurface model to investigate the spatial patterns\
    \ and tem-\nporal dynamics of river–aquifer exchange in a heterogeneous \nalluvial\
    \ river–aquifer system with deep water table. Tague \nand Pohl-Costello [62] also\
    \ examined how flow data from a \nsimilar watershed can serve to compensate for\
    \ this data limi-\ntation in the context of understanding impacts on hydrologic\
    \ \nbehavior. \nModel Parameter Estimation and Calibration \nParameter estimation\
    \ and calibration of hydrologic mod-\nels inherently possess significant challenges\
    \ associated with \nthe nature of most hydrologic models; namely (i) nonlinear-\n\
    ity; (ii) data errors; (iii) data insufficiency; (iv) correlation \namong parameters;\
    \ (v) irregular response surfaces that may \nbe insensitive to select model parameters;\
    \ and (vi) single or \nmulti-objective nature of the models [63]. Parameter estima-\n\
    tion techniques often further attempt to quantify uncertainty \nof these estimates\
    \ and may be divided into two primary ap-\nproaches: (i) Bayesian; and (ii) frequentist\
    \ [64]. Bayesian \nmethods treat model parameters as random variables that \n\
    possesses probability distributions that are iteratively refined \nby comparing\
    \ measured data with model outputs based on \nselection of different model parameters\
    \ derived from an ini-\ntial, best estimate, distribution [64]. In contrast, frequentist\
    \ \napproaches model parameters as fixed entities that are then \nadjusted through\
    \ comparison with a calibration data set \nthrough various means [64], including\
    \ (i) a priori estima-\ntions; (ii) curve fitting (including trial and error calibration,\
    \ \nmethod of moments, least squares, maximum likelihood, and \nlinear and nonlinear\
    \ regression); and (iii) combination meth-\nWatershed Modeling and its Applications\
    \ \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    29 \nods [63, 65]. Numerous earlier\
    \ and more recent reviews out-\nline parameter estimation, calibration, and uncertainty\
    \ analy-\nsis as applied to hydrologic models (e.g., [65-87]). As noted \nby McDonnell\
    \ et al. [88], improved predictions for ungauged \nbasins is critical for overall\
    \ advancement in watershed hy-\ndrologic modeling. So here we focus briefly on\
    \ select recent \nadvances employed where data is especially sparse, such as \n\
    in ungauged basins.  \nModel parameter estimation and calibration processes are\
    \ \nespecially challenging for ungauged basins, where sparse or \npoor data quality\
    \ often favor the use of empirical versus \nphysically-based models [89]. Recent\
    \ advances include use \nof a hydrological distributed model, linking GIS with\
    \ system \ndynamics, employing linear, nonlinear, and Markov Chain \nMonte Carlo\
    \ (MCMC) uncertainly analyses, and use of areal \nevapotranspiration in lieu of\
    \ stream flow. Velez et al. [90] \nemployed the conceptual, distributed runoff\
    \ model, TETIS, \nwith a parameter estimation methodology, generating a cor-\n\
    rection function that compared model parameter values at \nindividual model section\
    \ scale to overall watershed charac-\nteristics derived from available data, taking\
    \ into account spa-\ntial and temporal scale effects enabling reduction in the\
    \ \nnumber of parameters requiring calibration. Aragon et al. \n[91] explored\
    \ the modeling of ungauged tributaries through \nuse of GIS to model hydrological\
    \ response units and a sys-\ntem dynamics model to represent physical processes.\
    \ Here, \nGIS was used to convert time series outputs from the process \nmodels\
    \ to spatial representations, which then formed the \nbasis for estimating parameter\
    \ inputs to subsequent model \nruns. Although the system reflected reasonable\
    \ behaviors, \nthe model was not calibrated [91]. Gallagher and Doherty \n[64]\
    \ examined the performance of three separate parameter \nestimation and uncertainly\
    \ analysis methods employed in a \nlumped parameter surface flow model Hydrological\
    \ Simula-\ntion Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) [64]. Both linear and non-\nlinear uncertainly\
    \ methods provided relative parameter un-\ncertainty assessment and understanding\
    \ degree of correlation \nbetween model parameters, but both were limited in predic-\n\
    tive uncertainty. MCMC proved especially useful in provid-\ning qualitative information\
    \ on parameter probability distribu-\ntions, but required significantly greater\
    \ number of model \nruns to generate the probability distributions [64]. Employ-\n\
    ing a much different approach, Nandagiri [89] compared \ncalibration of a regional\
    \ surface runoff model in India using \nstreamflow records to areal evapotranspiration\
    \ estimations \nderived from meteorological data and evapotranspiration \nmodel.\
    \ Results suggest that areal evapotranspiration may \nsuccessfully be used to\
    \ calibrate hydrological models in un-\ngauged basins [89]. \nUse of Artificial\
    \ Intelligence in Watershed Modeling \nThe watershed models discussed earlier\
    \ adopt the physi-\ncally-based approach to modeling complex watershed proc-\n\
    esses on different spatial and temporal scales. Typically, this \nrequires describing\
    \ the watershed system’s inputs, the physi-\ncal laws which govern its behavior,\
    \ and boundary and initial \nconditions [19]. However, the traditional techniques\
    \ adopted \nin this approach tend be computationally intensive, requiring \nsignificant\
    \ data and calibration. To address some of these \nissues, researchers [e.g.,\
    \ 19, 92-96] have pursued a more \ndata-driven approach which utilize soft computing\
    \ or artifi-\ncial intelligence (AI), namely, artificial neural network \n(ANN),\
    \ fuzzy logic (FL), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). \nOver the past decade the literature\
    \ has recorded numerous \nexamples where researchers have successfully demonstrated\
    \ \nhow AI can be utilized for watershed hydrology applications \nsuch as real\
    \ time flood forecasting, rainfall–runoff modeling, \nand water quality prediction\
    \ models. The following \ndiscussion highlights selected past and more recent\
    \ water-\nshed hydrology applications using ANN, FL, and GA. \nArtificial Neural\
    \ Networks (ANN) \nANNs are considered computer programs capable of \nlearning\
    \ from examples through iteration without requiring \nprior knowledge of the relationships\
    \ between process pa-\nrameters [97, 98]. ANNs were inspired from biological nerv-\n\
    ous systems and are an attempt to emulate the human brain \n[98, 99]. Fig. (1)\
    \ illustrates the general ANN structure which \nis developed based on:  \n(1)\
    \ Many single elements called nodes (also known as \nunits, cells, or neurons),\
    \ shown as oval shapes and or-\nganized as layers. Each node typically applies\
    \ a non-\nlinear transformation called an activation function to \nits net input\
    \ signal to determine its output signal. \nThese functions enable ANN to map nonlinear\
    \ proc-\nesses.  \n(2) Signals pass between nodes through connection links. \n\
    Each connection link has an associated weight that \nrepresents its connection\
    \ strength. \n(3) Most ANN possess a transparent first or input layer \n(X) that\
    \ receives input variables or quantities that can \ninfluence the output or last\
    \ layer (Y) which consists \nof values needed to be predicted as part of a problem\
    \ \nor system. These networks also often possess middle \nor hidden layers which\
    \ are usually determined by a \ntrial-and-error procedure [100]. \nThe American\
    \ Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Task \nCommittee [100] notes that in order\
    \ for ANN to generate an \noutput, a training process, also called learning (similar\
    \ to the \nconcept of calibration in traditional physically-based mod-\nels),\
    \ is employed to iteratively adjust and optimize connec-\ntion weights and threshold\
    \ values for each node. The primary \ngoal of training is to minimize the error\
    \ function by search-\ning for a set of connection strengths and threshold values\
    \ that \ncause ANN to produce outputs that are equal or close to tar-\ngets. After\
    \ completing the training process, the next step is to \nutilize ANN to predict\
    \ results based on new inputs. See \nASCE-Task-Committee [100] for further details\
    \ on ANN \nfeatures and functionality. \nNoted strengths of ANNs which make their\
    \ use attractive \nfor water resources and hydrology applications include the\
    \ \nability to (i) recognize the relation between the input and \noutput variables\
    \ without explicit physical consideration; (ii) \nwork well even when the training\
    \ sets contain noise and \nmeasurement errors; (iii) adapt to solutions over time\
    \ to \ncompensate for changing circumstances; and (iv) possess \nother inherent\
    \ information-processing characteristics and \nonce trained are easy to use [100].\
    \ ANN hydrologic applica-\ntions range from the predictions of peak discharge\
    \ or time to \npeak for a single rainfall event, to the forecast of hourly or\
    \ \ndaily river stages or discharges. The complexities in physical \nprocesses\
    \ and nonlinear relationships of processes such as \n30    The Open Hydrology\
    \ Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al. \nrainfall-runoff and evapotransporation\
    \ were found to lend \nthemselves to ANN modeling [11, 101-103]. These ANN-\n\
    based models have been considered an alternate to physically \nbased models due\
    \ to their simplicity relative to minimizing \nthe need for collecting detailed\
    \ watershed data [102]. The \nmajor advantage of ANN over conventional methods\
    \ is the \nability to model physical processes without the need for de-\ntailed\
    \ information [104]. \nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, several research efforts\
    \ \n[e.g., 11, 103, 105-108] have shown ANN can be applied \neffectively across\
    \ different aspects of water resources and \nhydrology. Hjelmfelt and Wang [105,\
    \ 106] were among the \nfirst researchers to demonstrate the utility of ANNs in\
    \ mod-\neling these water resources processes. Here, they were able \nto use rainfall\
    \ and runoff data from 24 large storm events \nchosen from the Goodwater Creek\
    \ watershed (12.2 km2) in \ncentral Missouri to trainand test the ANNs. Results\
    \ revealed \nthat ANNs were able to generate a unit hydrograph better \nthan those\
    \ obtained through a standard gamma function rep-\nresentation. Smith and Eli\
    \ [107] were able to incorporate the \nspatial and temporal distribution information\
    \ of rainfall into \na ANN model that predicted peak discharge and time to peak\
    \ \nover a hypothetical watershed which was represented as a \ngrid of cells.\
    \ Using this method, they found the prediction of \nthe entire hydrograph to be\
    \ very accurate for multiple storm \nevents. Riad et al. [109] showed that ANN-based\
    \ models \nwere better than classical regression models for simulating \nrainfall-runoff\
    \ relations for a semiarid climate catchment \narea in Morocco. Recent work by\
    \ Wang et al. [110] con-\ncluded that ANN models not only out performed other\
    \ \nevapotransporation approximations developed in the semi-\narid region of Burikan\
    \ Faso, but they can also be utilized in \ndeveloping countries with adverse climatic\
    \ conditions [110]. \nOther studies [104, 111, 112] found that ANN models can\
    \ \npredict evapotranspiration and perform better than the Pen-\nman-Monteith\
    \ technique and other conventional methods. \nDespite the demonstrated benefits\
    \ of ANN, there are two \nkey challenges that should be mentioned. First, ANN\
    \ are \nusually implemented with a trial and error approach which \ntend to be\
    \ extremely time consuming [113]. May and Siva-\nkumar [114, 115] highlighted\
    \ this issue while investigating \nthe application of ANN and multi-linear regression\
    \ models \nfor predicting urban stormwater quality at unmonitored \ncatchments.\
    \ They concluded that both models generated \nsimilar prediction results but the\
    \ regression model appeared \nto represent a more applicable approach since it\
    \ was (i) faster \nto construct and apply; (ii) more transparent; and (iii) less\
    \ \nlikely to fit the limited data. The second limitation of ANNs \nidentified\
    \ by Moghaddamnia et al. [112] referenced the \ncomplicated input selection process.\
    \ They gained some suc-\ncess by using a gamma test to address this problem, explor-\n\
    ing different combinations of input data to assess their influ-\nence on evaporation\
    \ estimation modeling, showing that the \ngamma test greatly reduced model development\
    \ require-\nments, enabling provision of input data guidance prior to \nmodel\
    \ development. Despite these promising results, they \nsuggest that further evaluation\
    \ is needed, especially with \nrespect to its ability to assess validated data.\
    \  \nGenetic Algorithms (GA) \nGenetic Algorithms (GA) are nonlinear optimization\
    \ \nsearch techniques that imitate biological evolution processes \nof natural\
    \ selection and survival of the fittest [116, 117]. The \nmajor difference between\
    \ GAs and the other classical opti-\nmization techniques is that GAs work with\
    \ a population of \npossible solution while classical optimization techniques\
    \ \nwork with a single solution [118]. Soman et al. [119] sum-\nmarize the process\
    \ of creating GAs in the following steps:  \n(1) Generate a random number of solution\
    \ samples, \ncollectively called the population, within the feasi-\nble search\

    \ of decision \nvariables known as genes (can be in binary strings \nof ones and\
    \ zeros of user specifiedlength, or real \nvalue numbers or integers). \n(2) Each\

    \ Chromosomes with the highest fitness \nvalue will be given a higher probability\
    \ to obtain a \nmate, so as to produce offspring that may better fit \nthe environment.\
    \ This process of selecting mates is \ncalled selection. Once mates are selected,\
    \ genes of \ncorresponding mates, or parents, are systematically \nexchanged with\
    \ the conception that the resulting \nsolutions or offsprings will have higher\
    \ fitness val-\nues. The process of creating new individuals by \nsystematically\
    \ assigning genes of chosen mates to \nthe new individuals is known as crossover.\
    \ The \nnew chromosomes replace the old chromosomes, \nwhich have low fitness\
    \ values. \nThe process of selection and crossover is repeated for \nmany generations\
    \ with the objective of reaching the global \noptimal solution after a sufficient\
    \ number of generations. \nOther general forms of the GA include Genetic Program-\n\
    ming (GP) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which \nare explained in more\
    \ detail by Koza [120] and Ferreira \n[121].  \nSeveral early research efforts\
    \ demonstrated the useful-\nness of GA in water resources applications. Ritzel\
    \ et al. \n[118] adopted GA to solve groundwater pollution problems. \nWang and\
    \ Zheng [95] and Wu et al. [96] used GA-based \nfunctions to solve a groundwater\
    \ management model. Other \nresearchers [e.g., 122-128] made additional achievements\
    \ in \ndeveloping or improving rainfall-runoff models using GA. \nWang [127] was\
    \ successful in using GA with a local search \nmethod to calibrate the Xinanjiang\
    \ rainfall-runoff model. \nDrecourt [126] investigated the GP approach for flow\
    \ predic-\ntion on the Kirkton catchment in Scotland (United Kingdom) \nand found\
    \ that the results compared favorably with two op-\ntimally calibrated conceptual\
    \ models. Whigham and Crapper \n[128] compared a GP-based rainfall-runoff model\
    \ with a \ndeterministic lumped parameter model, based on the unit \nhydrograph\
    \ and found the results to be favorable as well. \nEfforts by Liong et al. [124]\
    \ were instrumental in demon-\nstrating GP as a new paradigm in rainfall-runoff\
    \ modeling. \nThey showed GP-based rainfall runoff relationships can \nserve as\
    \ alternatives to conventional (physically based and \nconceptual) rainfall runoff\
    \ models. In Singapore, Muttil and \nLiong [125] were able to apply GA programming\
    \ to generate \nempirically the underlying equations which connect input to \n\
    output for the Upper Bukit Timah watershed. \nMore recent research efforts [e.g.,\
    \ 19, 129-132] continue \nto demonstrate the utility of GA in support of water\
    \ re-\nsources applications. Guven et al. [131] developed a new \nGP-based model\
    \ for estimating reference evapotranspiration \nin northern California by using\
    \ five daily atmospheric vari-\nables (daily solar radiation, daily mean temperature,\
    \ average \ndaily relative humidity and wind speed). They concluded that \nthe\
    \ new model results were in good agreement with conven-\ntional evapotranspiration\
    \ models (here, the Penman-\nMonteith equation, Hargreaves-Samani equation, solar\
    \ radia-\ntion-based ET equation, Jensen-Haise equation, Jones-\nRitchie equation,\
    \ and Turc method) and can be used as an \nalternative approach. It was also concluded\
    \ that the GP-\nbased model offered a fast and practical method for accu-\nrately\
    \ estimating evapotransporation [131].  \nYao and Yang [132] note that the complexity\
    \ of parame-\nter optimization for a distributed watershed model goes far \nbeyond\
    \ the capability of traditional optimization methods. \nTo address this problem,\
    \ a new GA-based optimization \nmethod was developed and tested using the Distributed-\n\
    Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation model (DHSVM). Results of this \neffort demonstrate\
    \ the feasibility of GA in optimizing pa-\nrameters of the DHSVM model. Hejaziet\
    \ al. [129] and Preis \nand Ostfeld [19] demonstrated that GA can be coupled with\
    \ \nother flow or water quality models to develop and augment \ncalibration schemes.\
    \  \nGuven [130] investigated the use of linear genetic pro-\ngramming (a variant\
    \ of GP) for predicting time-series of \ndaily flow rates the Schuylkill River\
    \ at Berne, PA, USA and \nfound that the results showed good agreement with observed\
    \ \ndata. Results also showed that the GP-based model out per-\nformed an ANN-based\
    \ model. These findings demonstrate \nGP’s promise for predicting the nonlinear\
    \ and dynamic river \nflow parameters [130]. \nAlthough GAs have proven to be\
    \ an effective and power-\nful problem-solving strategy, they possess several\
    \ limita-\ntions. The common thread in many of the difficulties with \nGAs has\
    \ to do with their significant dependence on control \nparameters such as population\
    \ size, crossover probability, \nand choice of crossover operator [133]. Jackson\
    \ and Norgard \n[133] summarize these issues as follows: \n(1) A GA may not know\
    \ when it is done or lack \nproof of convergence. One possible way to deal \n\
    with this problem is to examine a series of consecu-\ntive generations for solution\
    \ improvement.  \n(2) GAs need to maintain a large population of solu-\ntions\
    \ which provides the genetic diversity needed to \nadequately explore the solution\
    \ space. Too small a \npopulation will result in premature convergence on \na\
    \ local minimum. While large populations enable \nsuperior performance, they also\
    \ require more mem-\nory and more execution time. \n(3) Excessive reliance on\
    \ crossover to introduce \nnew genetic material can also result in premature \n\
    convergence. The dominance of crossover as the \nprincipal stochastic process\
    \ may cause the popula-\ntion to become more homogeneous, and thus stag-\nnating\
    \ the evolutionary process.  \n(4) GAs are also known to have poor performance\
    \ \nin climbing local hills in the solution space which \nresults in reducing\
    \ accuracy for many real-valued \nproblems. This difficulty is a byproduct of\
    \ the sole \ndependence of the algorithm on stochastic processes \nto improve\
    \ solutions rather than on an analytical \napproach. \nJackson and Norgard [133]\
    \ suggest that these limitations \nof GAs can be addressed effectively by combining\
    \ GAs with \nother algorithms and techniques. \nFuzzy Logic (FL) \nThe FL approach\
    \ to modeling is based on the theory of \nfuzzy sets [134], where relationships\
    \ are defined verbally \n32    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel\
    \ et al. \ninstead of using known governing physical relationships. \nClassic\
    \ set theory assigns an item as a member of a set (1) or \na non-member of a set\
    \ (0), while a fuzzy set allows for gra-\ndations between full membership and\
    \ full non-membership. \nThe main idea is to define the fuzzy membership functions\
    \ \nwhich define relationships between input variables and out-\nputs of a system\
    \ [135]. Mahabir et al. [135] identify the main \nsteps for creating a FL-based\
    \ modeling system as follows:  \n(1) A membership function must be defined for\
    \ each \nvariable (input and output). The membership function de-\nfines the degree\
    \ to which the value of a variable belongs to \nthe group and is usually a linguistic\
    \ term, such as high, me-\ndium, or low. \n(2) The membership functions are related\
    \ by statements \nor rules, typically a series of IF–THEN statements. For ex-\n\
    ample, one rule would be: IF the rainfall is low (linguistic \nterm represented\
    \ by a membership function) THEN the run-\noff (output) is low (linguistic term\
    \ represented by a member-\nship function). \n(3) Each rule is evaluated through\
    \ a process called impli-\ncation, and the results of all of the rules are combined\
    \ in a \nprocess called aggregation. \n(4) The resulting function is evaluated\
    \ for a resulting \nvalue or score for the output variable (e.g., runoff) through\
    \ a \nprocess called defuzzification. \nThe two main FL-based modeling systems\
    \ included are: \n(i) fuzzy inference systems, which work on already con-\nstructed\
    \ rule-base mainly on the basis of expert knowledge, \nand (ii) fuzzy adaptive\
    \ systems, which can also build and \nadjust rule-base automatically based on\
    \ sample or training \ndata. Two significant advantages of FL–based models are\
    \ \ntheir ability to be error tolerant and integrate expert knowl-\nedge from\
    \ water resource specialists [94]. Guertin et al. \n[136] also point out that\
    \ the FL approach is well suited to \nwatersheds studies as many environmental\
    \ factors are best \nexpressed as gradients.  \nLike ANN and GA, the FL technique\
    \ does have its limi-\ntations. Three key disadvantages were identified in the\
    \ litera-\nture and presented here. Casper et al. [94] note that the larg-\nest\
    \ disadvantage of the fuzzy adaptive systems is its inability \nto extrapolate\
    \ without detailed expert knowledge about the \nwatershed system or process being\
    \ simulated. The second \ndisadvantage of fuzzy inference and fuzzy adaptive (aug-\n\
    mented with expert knowledge) systems is their strong reli-\nance on subjective\
    \ inputs from experts which might provide \nmore opportunity for their abuse [137].\
    \ Ferson and Tucker \n[138] also note that FL-based systems may also fail to cap-\n\
    ture the value range of complex data sets and the correlations \namong parameters.\
    \ Further details on FL theory and applica-\ntions are provided in Zimmermann\
    \ [139] and Dubois and \nPrade [140].  \nAccording to Yu and Yang [76], FL can\
    \ be applied to \nhydrologic modeling where a hydrologist defines the accept-\n\
    able degree of a simulation in the form of linguistic expres-\nsions such as ‘bad’\
    \ and ‘good’ based on their knowledge or \nexpert judgment. Researchers have been\
    \ successful in their \nearly attempts at applying FL for solving water resource\
    \ \nproblems or modeling hydrologic processes including infil-\ntration [141],\
    \ contaminant fate and transport [142], recon-\nstruction of missing precipitation\
    \ events [143] river level and \nflood forecasting [144, 145], rainfall-runoff\
    \ modeling [76, \n146, 147], daily future water demand modeling [148], \ndrought\
    \ classification [149], and regional drought prediction \n[150]. \nMore recent\
    \ research trends in the utilization of the FL \nmodeling approach highlight additional\
    \ efforts targeted at \ncombining other AI methods in hybrid systems. Chang et\
    \ al. \n[151] developed a FL based method that was applied to pre-\ncipitation\
    \ interpolation and utilized GA to determine parame-\nters for the FL functions\
    \ which represent locations without \nrainfall records and their surrounding rainfall\
    \ gauges. Cheng \net al. [80] combined FL-GA methods to develop a rainfall-\n\
    run model while Chidthong et al. [152] and Chen et al. [93] \nutilized similar\
    \ methods to forecast flooding. Combining FL \nand ANN also offer options for\
    \ improving modeling tech-\nniques and managing water resource problems. For example,\
    \ \nTayfur and Singh [153] demonstrated that FL-ANN based \nmodels can be useful\
    \ in simulating event based rainfall run-\noff on a watershed scale and are much\
    \ easier to construct \nthan the models based on the well-know kinematic wave\
    \ \napproximation method. Chang and Chang [154] utilized an \nadaptive neuro-fuzzy\
    \ (FL and ANN) inference system for \npredicting water levels in reservoirs. Firat\
    \ and Gungor [155] \nalso investigated the use of similar systems for estimating\
    \ \nriver flows. Chidthong et al. [152] were successful in devel-\noping a hybrid\
    \ system using FL, ANN, and GA for predict-\ning peak flooding.  \nSpatial Considerations\
    \ in Watershed Modeling \nAs previously mentioned, watershed modeling involves\
    \ a \nholistic approach that involves not only examining surface \nhydrology,\
    \ groundwater hydrology, or their interface as \nwhole systems, but attempting\
    \ to imitate the three regions as \none system. Scale-up of each of these regions\
    \ from the water \nbody (lake, river, stream, etc.) or aquifer to an entire catch-\n\
    ment or watershed presents obvious problems. One limita-\ntion is the availability\
    \ of precipitation, flow, land cover, etc. \ndata for the entire region. Another\
    \ consideration is the lim-\nited understanding of the interactions between smaller\
    \ hydro-\nlogic entities. Several studies have examined the effects of \nscaling\
    \ in watershed modeling [156-161]. Furthermore, the \nscale or resolution of data\
    \ used can impact the accuracy of \nthe model results [161-163]. The following\
    \ sections high-\nlight the more prominent issues relating to scale and data \n\
    resolution in watershed modeling.  \nScale-up from Hydrologic Models to Watershed\
    \ Models \nMuch work has been done to conceptualize watershed in-\nteractions\
    \ at the hillslope (sub-catchment) level resulting in \nhighly complex relationships\
    \ from field experimentation. \nSome suggest that watershed models should maintain\
    \ this \ncomplexity and efforts should be made to ensure that the \nsmaller scale\
    \ relationships are somehow incorporated into \nthe mesoscale watershed models\
    \ [164]. Unfortunately, data \nlimitations, computational complexity, and financial\
    \ con-\nstraints limit the amount of information that may be gathered \nfrom the\
    \ field to represent entire watersheds. Bloschl and \nSivapalan [158] published\
    \ a review of scale issues in hydro-\nlogical modelling at the catchment level\
    \ in 1995. In this, \ndiscussions on simplification versus aggregation of hydro-\n\
    Watershed Modeling and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume\
    \ 5    33 \nlogic parameters, scale up versus scale down, and the linkage \nacross\
    \ various modelling scales are presented.  \nProblems associated with scale-up\
    \ of hydrologic proc-\nesses to the watershed-scale include generalization and\
    \ over \nparameterization. Through generalization or simplification, \nprocesses\
    \ and variables that are applicable to a small portion \nof the watershed may\
    \ be applied to the entire region. In this, \nthe true representation of processes\
    \ taking place may be lost. \nOver parameterization occurs when the watershed\
    \ is repre-\nsented by multiple (possibly many) parameters/variables to \nthe\
    \ point that a holistic representation of the region is no \nlonger present [158].\
    \ While Jakeman and Hornberger [165] \nsuggest only a few parameters are identifiable/necessary\
    \ for \nhydrologic models, van Werkhoven et al. [166] argue that \nthe number\
    \ of parameters necessary for watershed modeling \nis dependent on the focus of\
    \ the model and experimental \ndesign. They suggest use of sensitivity analysis\
    \ and thorough \ninvestigation on the model behaviour to determine the ap-\npropriate\
    \ level of parameters involved to represent the water-\nshed. \nSivapalan [164]\
    \ suggests that identification of common \npatterns, or features found at the\
    \ hillslope scale within a \nwatershed can be applied to larger regions to assist\
    \ in scale-\nup to the watershed level. In addition, Wong [167] \nrecommends use\
    \ of physically-based models to replace \nempirical models noting that during\
    \ scale-up from empirical \nhydrologic models to watershed-scale models physically-\n\
    based relationships can be used to bridge the gaps. Kalin et \nal. [168] state\
    \ that the spatial scale of the catchment is \ndirectly proportional to the complexity\
    \ involved in modelling \nhydrologic processes of rainfall-runoff and surface\
    \ erosion. \nWhether a lumped or semi-distributed model is used is \ndependent\
    \ on the level of detail desired in the output and \ndata available for representing\
    \ the watershed.  \nImpacts of Data Resolution \nModeling the hydrologic responses\
    \ over a watershed re-\nquires use of soil maps and/or soil surveys to provide\
    \ infor-\nmation on the distribution of soil types and thus soil hydro-\nlogic\
    \ properties. Previously, soil maps produced from sur-\nveys of the region were\
    \ the only source of this information. \nNow, remote sensing (RS) and digital\
    \ terrain analysis can be \nutilized through geographic information system (GIS)\
    \ tech-\nniques [169] which are more accurate with higher resolution \ndata than\
    \ previous methods. In addition, the availability of \nprecipitation data may\
    \ be sparse and limiting. Gathering \nmeasurements over a large area may not be\
    \ economically \nfeasible, so modelers use genetic algorithms or other tech-\n\
    niques discussed previously to fill gaps and provide better \nrepresentation of\
    \ data over the entire watershed area. \nOften, digital elevation models (DEMs)\
    \ are used to iden-\ntify stream networks/rivers and the land slopes that contrib-\n\
    ute flow to these waterbodies. DEMs can be publicly ob-\ntained at various resolutions\
    \ (e.g., 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m), \nwhich can impact the accuracy of hydrograph\
    \ generation and \nidentification of tributaries/river networks [163]. DEMs are\
    \ \ndigital surfaces representing the area of interest with a grid \nof given\
    \ resolution placed over the surface and elevation data \nassigned to each cell.\
    \ Each DEM grid cell drains a specific \ndirection based upon its slope and the\
    \ slope of the cells \naround it. Streams or channel networks are identified by\
    \ us-\ning the slope information of DEM grid cells and assigning a \nthreshold\
    \ area (the minimum area that would drain to a point \nfor a stream channel to\
    \ form). The stream network is com-\nprised of a set of points that have summed\
    \ areas of cells \nabove the threshold value draining toward them. The resolu-\n\
    tion of the DEM can impact the slope of grid cells due to the \narea covered and\
    \ averaging of elevations, and thus, the iden-\ntification of stream networks\
    \ [168, 170]. DEM resolution \nalso impacts the delineation of the watersheds.\
    \ Ridge lines \nare commonly used to define watersheds because these rep-\nresent\
    \ the divide for which portion of precipitation flows in \nwhich direction.  \n\
    In a study by Zhu and Mackay [169], the impacts of us-\ning traditional soil maps\
    \ versus soil information derived \nfrom both fuzzy logic and digital elevation\
    \ models (DEMs) \nwere evaluated for the Lubrecht area in Montana. Using the \n\
    newer technology, they found that peak runoff was reduced \nthus producing more\
    \ realistic hydrographs. Yang et al. [163], \nevaluated the effects of DEM resolution\
    \ on geomorphic \nproperties (i.e., identification of river networks and hydro-\n\
    logical response). In their study, fifteen catchments in Japan \nwere analyzed\
    \ using differing DEM resolutions. An increase \nin DEM mesh size (less resolution)\
    \ led to loss in the amount \nof tributaries identified, flatter topography due\
    \ to averaging \nof elevations for individual DEM grid cells and less accurate\
    \ \nrepresentation of the hydrological response of the catchment \n[163].  \n\
    The required resolution of data used in the modeling ef-\nfort may be dependent\
    \ on the output desired. Kalin et al. \n[168] evaluated the resolution required\
    \ for different outputs \nfor two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimen-\n\
    tal watersheds. When the peak runoff is the primary concern, \nthe highest resolution\
    \ is optimal. Meanwhile, if modelers are \nonly interested in sediment load at\
    \ the outlet, lower resolu-\ntion of model input data may be used.  \nHydrologic\
    \ and Hydrodynamic Models for Watershed \nModeling \nThis section provides a review\
    \ of current state-of-the-art \nof watershed-scale models, including discussion\
    \ of their \nstrengths and weaknesses when applied to various watershed \nand\
    \ related problems. Recent reviews by Singh and Wool-\nhiser [39], Borah and Bera\

    \ (AGN-\nPS/AnnAGNPS) \nThe current version of AGNPS is the AnnAGNPS model \n\
    [173, 174] which was developed to simulate, on a daily time \nstep, the sediment\
    \ and nutrient transport from an agricultural \nwatershed, ranging in size from\
    \ a few hectares up to 300,000 \nhectares (3x109 m2). AnnAGNPS is a semi-empirical,\
    \ dis-\ntributed, continuous simulation watershed-scale model with \noutput options\
    \ for an event, monthly, or annual basis [173, \n174]. The AnnAGNPS model can\
    \ assist with the manage-\nment of runoff, erosion, and nutrient movement by perform-\n\
    ing cost-benefit analysis. The model can simulate several \nbest management practices\
    \ (BMPs) including ponds, vegeta-\ntive filters strips, riparian buffers, and\
    \ others [37]. Borah and \nBera [5] also note that the model is useful for analyzing\
    \ \nlong-term effects of hydrological changes and watershed \nmanagement practices,\
    \ especially agricultural practices. The \nmodel has been utilized in several\
    \ studies with mixed results \n[175-178]. In Australia, Baginska et al. [179]\
    \ showed the \nevent flow predictions to be satisfactory, Das et al. [180] \n\
    were able to produce runoff results for the Canagagigue \nCreek watershed of southwestern\
    \ Ontario with acceptable \naccuracy, while Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al.\
    \ [175] \nhighlighted that the model can produce adequate results for \npredicting\
    \ long-term monthly and annual runoff.  \nKey limitations of the AnnAGNPS model\
    \ include: (i) an \ninability to simulate base flow or frozen soil conditions;\
    \ (ii) \nthe mass balance calculation for water inflow and outflow is \nnot provided\
    \ as the model does not account for spatially \nvarying rainfall over the watershed;\
    \ and (iii) the runoff simu-\nlation is not entirely based on physical laws [6].\
    \ Model re-\nsults from Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al. [175] show that \n\
    the overland flow inadequately represented the riparian ar-\neas, and predictions\
    \ on nutrients and sediment loads are \noverestimated. Proper cell discretization\
    \ was suggested as an \noption for improving runoff estimates. In Nepal, Shrestha\
    \ et \nal. [181] showed that model event-based peak flow results \nwere over predicted.\
    \ AnnAGNPS is also not adequately for-\nmulated to simulate intense single-event\
    \ storms [171]. Borah \net al. [182] concluded that the AGNPS model is not suitable\
    \ \nfor analyzing a storm when the flow and constituent concen-\ntrations and\
    \ loads drastically vary. They also noted that the \nuse of AGNPS in studying\
    \ impacts of BMPs is qualitative \nsince AGNPS does consider subsurface and groundwater\
    \ \nprocesses [183]. \nBoth AGNPS and AnnAGNPS use the Curve Number \n(CN) method,\
    \ which does not reproduce measured runoff \nfrom specific storm rainfall events\
    \ because the time distribu-\ntion is not considered [183-187]. Additional limitations\
    \ in-\nclude: (i) no explicit account of the effect of the antecedent \nmoisture\
    \ conditions in runoff computation; (ii) difficulties in \nseparating storm runoff\
    \ from the total discharge hydrograph; \nand (iii) runoff processes not considered\
    \ by the empirical \nformula [183, 186, 187]. Croley and He [188] suggest that\
    \ \nthese limitations will result in CN estimates of runoff and \ninfiltration\
    \ which are not reflective of actual values. In addi-\ntion, they note that sediment,\
    \ nutrient, and pesticide load-\nings, which are directly related to infiltration\
    \ and runoff, may \ngenerate inaccurate estimates for non-point source pollution\
    \ \nrates. \n36    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al.\
    \ \nAreal Non-PointSource Watershed Environment Simula-\ntion (ANSWERS) \nANSWERS\
    \ is comprised of two major response compo-\nnents: hydrology [189] and upland\
    \ erosion [190]. The water-\nshed area is divided into grids (less than 10,000\
    \ m) where all \nproperties (e.g., soil properties, land use, slopes, crops, nutri-\n\
    ents, and management practices) are considered homoge-\nnous. ANSWERS-2000, an\
    \ expanded version of ANSWERS \n[191], utilizes breakpoint rainfall data and performs\
    \ simula-\ntion on 30-second time steps for runoff events and a daily \ntime step\
    \ between runoff events. Simulation is limited to \nmedium-size watersheds (5x106\
    \ to 3x107 m) where surface \nhydrologic processes dominate. In addition, the\
    \ model also \nhas the capability of simulating transformations and interac-\n\
    tions between four nitrogen pools including stable organic N, \nactive organic\
    \ N, nitrate, and ammonium. A surface runoff \nhydrograph is provided at both\
    \ the watershed outlet and any \nother user-selected point within the watershed\
    \ [192]. \nANSWERS and ANSWERS-2000 models were designed \nfor ungauged watersheds,\
    \ as well as for evaluating the effec-\ntiveness of agricultural and urban watershed\
    \ best manage-\nment practices (BMPs) in decreasing sediment and nutrient \ntransport\
    \ to streams during surface runoff events [37, 193]. \nAvailable literature [6,\
    \ 171, 193-195] provides some of the \nachievements and issues related to the\
    \ application of these \nmodels. For example, Connolly et al. [194] showed that\
    \ \nANSWERS could be used to predict runoff at a catchment \noutlet and generate\
    \ fairly accurate simulations for different \nsurface cover conditions; however,\
    \ runoff predictions were \nless accurate at low rainfall intensity events when\
    \ compared \nto higher intensity events. They also pointed out that com-\nplex\
    \ watersheds could be modeled without calibration; al-\nthough promoting confidence\
    \ in the model, one would be ill-\nadvised to follow such advice. \nDillaha et\
    \ al. [193] evaluated ANSWERS-2000 on two \nwatersheds in Watkinsville, Georgia;\
    \ it performed well in \npredicting runoff, sediment, nitrate, dissolved ammonium,\
    \ \nsediment-bound total Kjeldahlnitrogen (TKN), and dissolved \nphosphorus losses\
    \ from both watersheds. They also tested \nthe model on the 1,153 hectare (1.15x107\
    \ m2) Owl Run wa-\ntershed in Virginia, where it also performed well for the \n\
    largest storms, and cumulative predictions of runoff volume, \nsediment yield,\
    \ nitrate, ammonium, sediment-bound TKN, \nand orthophosphorus were within 40\
    \ percent of the measured \nvalues. Other research by Bai et al. [195] showed\
    \ that the \nmodel adequately simulated runoff during non-snow seasons.  \nOogathoo\
    \ [6] notes that a key weakness of ANSWERS is \nits inability to simulate interflow\
    \ and groundwater contribu-\ntions to base flow, snow pack, and snowmelt. This\
    \ suggests \nthe model is less suitable for locations where base flow con-\ntribution,\
    \ winter snow accumulation, and snow melt are high. \nBorah and Bera [5] also\
    \ noted ANSWERS is not adequately \nformulated to simulate intense single-event\
    \ storms and has \npotential numerical problems inherent in its solutions. They\
    \ \nalso mentioned that ANSWERS-2000 does not have channel \nerosion and sediment\
    \ transport routines; therefore, the sedi-\nment and chemical components are not\
    \ applicable to water-\nsheds. Like AGNPS and AnnAGNPS, ANSWERS and AN-\nSWERS-2000\
    \ utilize the CN method and face the same limi-\ntations identified earlier by\
    \ Beven [186], Croley and He \n[188], and Garen and Moore [187].  \nGridded \n\
    Surface \nSubsurface \nHydrologic \nAnalysis \n(GSSHA)/CASC2D \nCASC2D [196] is\
    \ a physically-based model that was de-\nveloped to predict surface runoff in\
    \ arid to semi-arid basins. \nWater and sediment are simulated in two-dimensional\
    \ over-\nland grids and one-dimensional channels. Both single-event \nand long-term\
    \ continuous simulations are possible. The wa-\ntershed is divided into cells,\
    \ and water and sediment are \nrouted from one to another. GSSHA [31, 32], an\
    \ enhance-\nment of CASC2D, adds the ability to simulate saturated and \nunsaturated\
    \ groundwater, allowing use of the model in a va-\nriety of climates and watersheds.\
    \ While increasing the capa-\nbility of the CASC2D model, all functionality of\
    \ the \nCASC2D model has been retained, with significant im-\nprovements in model\
    \ stability and efficiency.  \nGSSHA, a component within the U.S. Department of\
    \ De-\nfense’s (DOD) Watershed Modeling System (WMS) [197], \nwas developed to\
    \ provide hydrologic predictions in the wid-\nest variety of places and conditions\
    \ including the complex \nspatial organization in an urban environment. This may\
    \ have \nimportant implications for the development of techniques for \nTable\

    \ in urbanized \nareas [31]. GSSHA has new or improved CASC2D features \nsuch\
    \ as the ability to simulate major hydrologic storage units \n(e.g., lakes, wetlands,\
    \ and reservoirs) and an improvement in \nthe predictions of in-stream sediment\
    \ transport, especially \nduring large rainfall events [31]. Both models were\
    \ tested on \nthe Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed in Mississippi \nwhere\
    \ it was shown that the accuracy of sediment discharge \nfor selected storms was\
    \ superior when using GSSHA [31, \n198]. Despite these results, other studies\
    \ [e.g., 37] indicate \nthat the model may have major limitations such as the\
    \ poten-\ntial to generate very poor sediment results. Kalin and Han-\ntush [37]\
    \ suggest erosion in channels is not transport limited, \nwhich means the model\
    \ generates sediment that has a vol-\nume greater than what the flow can carry.\
    \ Another limitation \nfor the model is its numerical schemes, which are computa-\n\
    tionally intensive and demand large amounts of data [171]. \nAccording to Ogden\
    \ and Julien [199], simulation times can \nbecome prohibitive when the number\
    \ of model grid cells \nexceeds 100,000; therefore, the model may become prohibi-\n\
    tive for medium to large-sized watersheds [171]. \nHEC-1/HEC-HMS  \nHEC-1, developed\
    \ to simulate hydrologic processes (pre-\ncipitation, losses, baseflow, runoff\
    \ transformation, and rout-\ning) on watersheds ranging in size from 1 km2 to\
    \ 100,000 \nkm2, produces runoff hydrographs at single or multiple loca-\ntions\
    \ on complex watershed networks for gauged and hypo-\nthetical rainfall events\
    \ [200]. HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engi-\nneering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System)\
    \ [201, 202] is \nthe “next generation\" and state-of-the-art Windows-based \n\
    model for precipitation-runoff simulation that will supersede \nthe HEC-1 model.\
    \ HEC-HMS provides a variety of options \nfor simulating precipitation-runoff\
    \ and routing processes, \nand is comprised of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\
    \ [203], \nintegrated hydrologic analysis components, data storage and \nmanagement\
    \ capabilities, and graphics and reporting facili-\nties [201, 202]. Both HEC-1\
    \ [200] and HEC-HMS [201] \nhave been widely used for modeling floods and impacts\
    \ on \nland use changes [6]. Duru and Hjelmfelt [204], using the \nmodel's kinematic\
    \ wave method, found that even with lim-\nited calibration, runoff prediction\
    \ for ungauged catchments \nwas good and impacts of land use on the hydrologic\
    \ cycle \ncould be evaluated accurately. Additionally, a study con-\nducted in\
    \ northern Ontario, Canada showed that HEC-1 \nmodel could be used for runoff\
    \ simulation in an ungauged \nwatershed [205].  \nEven though HEC-1/HEC-HMS has\
    \ been widely used, \nOogathoo [6] notes that it excludes certain important fea-\n\
    tures. The model is constrained to a constant time step, \nwhich may not be suitable\
    \ for components requiring detailed \nanalysis. Since it is semi-distributed,\
    \ the model assumes hy-\ndrologic processes to occur uniformly within each sub-basin.\
    \ \nAlso, as the primary purpose of the model is to determine \nflood hydrographs,\
    \ a simple method is used for the baseflow \nsimulation; therefore, the loss component\
    \ of the model is not \ntracked down in absence of precipitation, that is, the\
    \ soil \ndoes not dry out and recover its loss potential. Other limita-\ntions\
    \ identified by Scharffenberg [201] include uncoupled \nmodels for evapotranspiration-infiltration\
    \ and infiltration-\nbase flow processes, no aquifer interactions, the allowance,\
    \ \nbut limited capability, of flow splits within the dendritic \nstream systems,\
    \ and the lack of downstream flow influence \nor reversal which makes backwater\
    \ possible but only if con-\ntained within a reach.  \nHydrological Simulation\
    \ Program-Fortran (HSPF) \nHSPF [206, 207] is a semi-distributed, continuous model\
    \ \nthat simulates hydrologic and associated water quality proc-\nesses on pervious\
    \ and impervious land surfaces, in streams, \nand in well-mixed impoundments where\
    \ water movement is \nsimulated as overland flow, interflow, and groundwater flow.\
    \ \nAlso simulated are snowpack depth and water content, \nsnowmelt, evapotranspiration,\
    \ ground-water recharge, dis-\nsolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, temperature,\
    \ \npesticides, conservatives, fecal coliforms, sediment detach-\nment and transport,\
    \ sediment routing by particle, size, chan-\nnel routing, reservoir routing, constituent\
    \ routing, pH, am-\nmonia, nitrate-nitrite, organic nitrogen, orthophosphate,\
    \ or-\nganic phosphorous, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The \nmodel utilizes\
    \ hydrological response units (HRUs) based on \nuniform climate and storage capacity\
    \ factors. Periods from a \nfew minutes to hundreds of years can be simulated.\
    \ \nSimulation results include a time history of the runoff flow \nrate, \nsediment\
    \ \nload, \nand \nnutrient \nand \npesticide \nconcentrations, along with a time\
    \ history of water quantity \nand quality at any point in a watershed. HSPF simulates\
    \ \nthree sediment types (sand, silt, and clay) in addition to a \nsingle organic\
    \ chemical and transformation products of that \nchemical [206, 207]. \nGenerally\
    \ used to assess the effects of land use change, \nreservoir operations, point\
    \ or non-point source treatment \nalternatives, and flow diversions [37], HSPF\
    \ is also suitable \nfor mixed agricultural and urban watersheds [171]. Some of\
    \ \nthe key strengths of the model identified by Aqua Terra \n[208] include: (i)\
    \ a comprehensive representation of water-\nshed land, stream processes, and watershed\
    \ pollutant \nsources, including non-point (by multiple land uses), point, \n\
    and atmospheric sources; (ii) flexibility and adaptability to a \nwide range of\
    \ watershed conditions; and (iii) well-designed \ncode modularity and structure.\
    \ Oogathoo [6] and AquaTerra \n[208] note that HSPF’s key limitations derive from\
    \ it not \nbeing fully distributed or physically-based. As a result, wa-\ntershed\
    \ characteristics and climatic parameters are lumped \ninto several units, and\
    \ both empirical and physical equations \nare used to simulate the water flow\
    \ [6]. In addition, due to its \nconceptualization of the overland (sub-basin)\
    \ areas as lev-\neled detention storage and use of the storage-based or non-\n\
    linear flow equations in routings, HSPF is not adequate for \nsimulating intense\
    \ single-event storms, especially for large \nsub-basins and long channels [6,\
    \ 171]. The model requires \nextensive data requirements (e.g., hourly rainfall)\
    \ and avail-\nable documentation provides no comprehensive parameter \nestimation\
    \ guidance. As a result, user training is normally \nrequired [208]. In their\
    \ effort to evaluate the model, Saleh \nand Du [209] highlighted these issues\
    \ as they found the cali-\nbration process tends to be strenuous and long. \n\
    Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) \nRepresented by a cascade of planes\
    \ and channels, \nKINEROS2 may be used to determine the effects of various \n\
    artificial features such as urban developments, small deten-\ntion reservoirs,\
    \ or lined channels on flood hydrographs and \nsediment yield [33]. The model\
    \ is also adopted as part of the \n38    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume\
    \ 5 \nDaniel et al. \nAutomated \nGeospatial \nWatershed \nAssessment \nTool \n\
    (AGWA) software system [210, 211]. Limited to Hortonian \nflow \nand \nnot \n\
    designed \nfor \nlong-term \nsimulations, \nKINEROS2 lacks an evapotranspiration\
    \ component impor-\ntant for the mass balance of the water cycle [37]; however,\
    \ \nwith its complete set of hydrology and sediment components, \nthe model serves\
    \ as a useful tool for studying single severe \nor design storms and evaluating\
    \ watershed management \npractices, especially structural practices [171]. Using\
    \ a small \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimental wa-\ntershed located\
    \ near Treynor, Iowa, Kalin and Hantush[37] \ntested the model and showed that\
    \ it was also extremely ro-\nbust in simulating erosion and sediment transport.\
    \ The model \nwas designed for arid and semi-arid areas [212]; however, \nseveral\
    \ studies [210, 213-215] highlight the ability of the \nmodel to successfully\
    \ simulate erosion, sediment transport, \nand characterize the runoff response\
    \ of the watershed due to \nchanges of land cover in arid and semi-arid watersheds.\
    \ La-\njili-Ghezal [215] conducted similar assessments on the \nM'Richet El Anze\
    \ watershed in a Tunisian semi-arid area \nand concluded that the model was adequate\
    \ for predicting \nrunoff from ungauged watersheds and for evaluating future \n\
    land use master-plans for Tunisian semi-arid high lands. \nMiller et al. [210]\
    \ also used KINEROS2 within the AGWA \nframework to successfully assess increased\
    \ event runoff vol-\numes and flashier flood response in watersheds that contrib-\n\
    ute runoff to the upper San Pedro River in Sonora, Mexico \nand southeast Arizona.\
    \ \nUnlike most of the studies mentioned, Al-Qurashiet al. \n[212] were less successful\
    \ when assessing the model using \ndata from a large arid catchment in Oman. Despite\
    \ relatively \nextensive and high resolution rainfall-runoff data, and their \n\
    efforts to optimize performance using automatic calibration \nand by adding a\
    \ rainfall parameter, the model validation per-\nformance was poor, and in general,\
    \ no better than achieved \nusing a ‘default’ parameter set [212]. Borah and Bera\
    \ [5] \nnote that the model does a relatively good job of simulating \nrunoff\
    \ and sediment yield at watershed scales of up to ap-\nproximately 1,000 hectares\
    \ (1x107 m2); however, such poor \nresults may arise since applications of the\
    \ model are limited \nto small watersheds and specific combinations of space and\
    \ \ntime increments for maintaining stability of the numerical \nsolutions. Overall,\
    \ a key weakness of the model is the ab-\nsence of chemical/nutrient components\
    \ [171] which limit its \ncapabilities to simulate for BMPs [37]. \nMIKE SHE \
    \ \nMIKE SHE is a fully integrated, distributed, and physi-\ncally-based watershed\
    \ model that simulates the major proc-\nesses in the hydrologic cycle and includes\
    \ process models for \nevapotranspiration, overland flow, unsaturated flow, ground\
    \ \nflow, channel flow, and their interactions [34]. It is used \nmostly at the\
    \ watershed scale and from a single soil profile to \nseveral sub-watersheds with\
    \ different soil types [216, 217]. \nThe model's distributed nature allows a spatial\
    \ distribution of \nwatershed parameters, climate variables, and hydrological\
    \ \nresponse through an orthogonal grid network and column of \nhorizontal layers\
    \ at each grid square in the horizontal and \nvertical, respectively [218]. The\
    \ model can be used for storm \nor long-term events with a variable time step.\
    \ Being physi-\ncally-based, the topography, along with watershed character-\n\
    istics such as vegetation and soil properties, is included in \nthe model. With\
    \ a modular structure, MIKE SHE is capable \nof exchanging data between components\
    \ as well as adding \nnew process model components. The flexible operating \n\
    structure of MIKE SHE allows the use of as many or as few \ncomponents of the\
    \ model, based on availability of data [219].  \nMIKE SHE is considered the most\
    \ comprehensive water-\nshed model with virtually all of the in-surface and surface\
    \ \nphases of the hydrologic cycle [37]. It also has many of the \noptions to\
    \ simulate wetlands, and nutrient and pesticide \nmanagement. The model is being\
    \ used for a wide variety of \napplications in different countries, including\
    \ England [220], \nAustralia [221], Canada [6], and the United States [222]. \n\
    Some of the notable application areas include river basin \nmanagement and modeling\
    \ [223], integrated ground/surface \nwater modeling [221, 222], irrigation [224-226],\
    \ land use \nchanges, and anthropogenic effects [27].  \nThompson et al. [220]\
    \ used the model simulated in a wet-\nland in England and found that the simulation\
    \ results consis-\ntently matched the observed data and reproduced the sea-\n\
    sonal dynamics of groundwater and ditch water levels. Sahoo \net al. [84] used\
    \ the model in a mountainous region of Hawaii \nto study watershed response to\
    \ storm events and found the \nresults were comparable to the observed data. In\
    \ addition, \nDemetriou and Punthakey [221] concluded that the model \nwas accurate\
    \ in predicting water movement from aquifers, \ndrainage and supply systems, and\
    \ land surfaces across an \nAustralian watershed with a complex hydro-geological\
    \ re-\ngime. Overall, Singh et al. [227] showed that the model can \nbe utilized\
    \ for irrigation planning and management of water \nresources for agricultural\
    \ purposes.  \nMany of the MIKE SHE applications also involve cou-\npling with\
    \ other models; the model can interface with Model \nof Urban Sewers (MOUSE) to\
    \ simulate the effect of urban \ndrainage and sewer systems on the surface/subsurface\
    \ hy-\ndrology [34, 228, 229] and is also frequently coupled with \n(DAISY), a\
    \ detailed soil-plant-atmosphere model for agricul-\nture related studies [34,\
    \ 230, 231]. Like the GSSHA model, \nMIKE SHE faces the problem of being computationally\
    \ in-\ntensive and may be prohibitive for medium to large-sized \nwatersheds [171].\
    \ Borah and Bera [5] further point out that \nthe physically based flow-governing\
    \ equations use approxi-\nmate numerical solutions, which are subject to computational\
    \ \ninstability problems, and limited on space and time incre-\nments and watershed\
    \ sizes. \nPrecipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)/Modular \nModeling System\
    \ (MMS) \nPRMS [232] is a modular-design, deterministic, distrib-\nuted model\
    \ that simulates precipitation- and snowmelt-\ndriven movement of water through\
    \ the watershed via over-\nland flow, interflow, and baseflow. Watershed response\
    \ can \nbe simulated at a daily time step or more frequently over the \ncourse\
    \ of a storm. The watershed is divided into sub-units \nbased on basin characteristics\
    \ such as slope, aspect, eleva-\ntion, vegetation type, soil type, land use, and\
    \ precipitation \ndistribution. Two levels of partitioning are available for \n\
    PRMS. The first divides the basin into HRUs based on the \nbasin characteristics\
    \ where water and energy balances are \ncomputed daily for each HRU; the sum of\
    \ the responses of \nall HRU's, weighted on a unit-area basis, produces the daily\
    \ \nsystem response and streamflow for a basin. A second level \nWatershed Modeling\
    \ and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    39 \nof\
    \ partitioning is available for storm hydrograph simulation \nwhere the watershed\
    \ is conceptualized as a series of inter-\nconnected flow planes and channel segments.\
    \ Surface runoff \nis routed over the flow planes into the channel segments and\
    \ \nchannel flow is routed through the watershed channel sys-\ntem. A HRU can\
    \ be considered the equivalent of a flow \nplane or it can be delineated into\
    \ a number of flow planes \n[232, 233]. PRMS was redesigned and now forms the\
    \ basis \nof the US Geological Society (USGS) Modular Modeling \nSystem (MMS)\
    \ [232].  \nPRMS [233] has been applied in different regions around \nthe world.\
    \ Applications range from the investigation of se-\nlected process components\
    \ to streamflow simulation and the \nintegration of MMS with other models [234].\
    \ One of the \nmajor benefits of MMS is its support for the integration of \n\
    models and tools at a variety of levels [232]. Design levels \ninclude individual\
    \ process models, tightly coupled models, \nloosely coupled models, and fully\
    \ integrated decision sup-\nport systems [234]. Several studies [235-237] have\
    \ focused \non this aspect of the model with some success. Steuer and \nHunt [236]\
    \ and Hunt and Steuer [235] used the model to \nstudy the effects of urbanization\
    \ and land use changes on \nground water recharge, and explicitly fed the results\
    \ into the \nU.S. Geologic Survey groundwater model, Modular Three-\nDimensional\
    \ \nFinite-Difference \nGround-Water \nFlow \nModel(MODFLOW), for other studies\
    \ in Dane County, Wis-\nconsin. Hobson [237] coupled the model with a stochastic\
    \ \nweather generator as a framework to simulate weather vari-\nables and streamflows\
    \ in the Upper Truckee River Basin on \nthe California and Nevada border. The\
    \ model can also be \neffectively used to evaluate the effects of climate variability,\
    \ \nchange on water resources, water management [234], and \nsimulate floods including\
    \ the representing flood wave propa-\ngation from single rainfall events [5].\
    \ Valeo and Xiang [238] \ndemonstrated this capability by analyzing climate change\
    \ \nimpacts on flooding from the Elbow River watershed in the \nfoothills of the\
    \ Rocky Mountains. In addition, Yates et al. \n[239] utilized the model with historical\
    \ radar rainfall and \nforecast data to simulate flash flooding on a watershed\
    \ that \nwas partially burned during a forest fire. Other examples of \nthese\
    \ studies were conducted in several regions of the world, \nincluding the Main\
    \ Ethiopian Rift Valley [240], river basins \nin the Sierra Nevada of California\
    \ [241], and the Arno River \nin Italy [242]. \nBorah and Bera [5] identified\
    \ the following key weak-\nnesses of PRMS/MMS: (i) like KINEROS2, the model was\
    \ \ndesigned for single rainfall events using one-dimensional \nflow equations\
    \ and has potential numerical problems inher-\nent to the numerical solutions;\
    \ (ii) in the Storm Mode, the \nmodel has hydrology and overland sediment, but\
    \ no chemi-\ncal component, sediment simulation in stream channels, and \nsubsurface\
    \ flow simulations; and (iii) the physically based \nflow-governing equations\
    \ use approximate numerical solu-\ntions which are subject to computational instability\
    \ prob-\nlems, and limited on space and time increments and water-\nshed sizes.\
    \ \nSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) \nSWAT [35, 36] is a physically-based,\
    \ continuous-time \nwatershed model that operates on a daily time step and is\
    \ \ndesigned to predict the impact of management on water, \nsediment, and agricultural\
    \ chemical yields in ungauged wa-\ntersheds. The watershed is divided into multiple\
    \ subwater-\nsheds, which are then further subdivided into HRUs that \nconsist\
    \ of homogeneous land use, management, and soil \ncharacteristics. The HRUs represent\
    \ percentages of the sub-\nwatershed area and are not identified spatially within\
    \ a \nSWAT simulation. Alternatively, a watershed can only be \nsubdivided into\
    \ subwatersheds that are characterized by \ndominant land use, soil type, and\
    \ management. Output for \nthe model includes evapotranspiration, soil water storage,\
    \ \nand water yield (surface runoff plus subsurface flow) [35, \n36]. The model\
    \ has been adopted as part of the USEPA’s \nBetter Assessment Science Integrating\
    \ Point and Nonpoint \nSources (BASINS) system [243] and AGWA [210, 211] \nsoftware\
    \ systems because it is a widely accepted continuous \nmodel suitable for agricultural\
    \ and forest land uses [5, 168]. \nBased on these core strengths, Gassman et al.\
    \ [36] found that \nthe primary applications of SWAT are calibration and/or \n\
    sensitivity analysis, climate change impacts, GIS interface \ndescriptions, hydrologic\
    \ assessments, variation in configura-\ntion or data input effects, comparisons\
    \ with other models or \ntechniques, interfaces with other models, and pollutant\
    \ as-\nsessments. The foundation strength of SWAT in many of \nthese applications\
    \ is the combination of simplified upland \nand channel processes that are incorporated\
    \ into the model \nnoted by Gassman et al. [36]. The incorporation of the CN \n\
    method and non-spatial HRUs supports model adaptation to \nvirtually any watershed\
    \ with a wide variety of hydrologic \nconditions [36].  \nSWAT has produced favorable\
    \ model results when \nevaluated on watersheds with a range of conditions in the\
    \ \nU.S. and many other countries such as Korea [244], Canada \n[245], China [246],\
    \ Finland [247], India [248-250], Tunisia \n[251], and Greece [252]; across many\
    \ of these watersheds, \nSWAT has shown flexibility in simulating surface runoff.\
    \ \nFor example, Du et al. [253] demonstrated that a modified \nversion of the\
    \ SWAT model was able to generate reasonable \nsimulation results for surface\
    \ and subsurface flows, water \ntable dynamics, tile flow, potholes, surface tile\
    \ inlets, and \naeration stress on plants for large flat landscapes. Gebremes-\n\
    kel et al. [245] stated that the SWAT model performed very \nwell for stream flow\
    \ prediction in the Canagagigue Creek \nwatershed of southwestern Ontario, Canada.\
    \ Several studies \nhave also demonstrated the utility of SWAT as a tool for \n\
    evaluating how stream flow can be affected by climate \nchange [254-256]. \nWith\
    \ a flexible framework, SWAT facilitates the calcula-\ntion of TMDLs and simulation\
    \ of a wide variety of conserva-\ntion practices and other BMPs (e.g., fertilizer\
    \ and manure \napplication rate and timing, irrigation management, and \nflood\
    \ prevention structures) [36]. Several studies illustrate \nthe success of SWAT\
    \ in conducting these types of simula-\ntions as part of an overall BMP assessment.\
    \ For example, \nSanthi et al. [257] were able to use SWAT to determine the \n\
    impacts of manure and nutrient related BMPs, forage harvest \nmanagement, and\
    \ other BMPs on water quality in the West \nFork watershed in Texas. Chaplot et\
    \ al.’s [258] efforts with \nSWAT showed that the adoption of no tillage, changes\
    \ in \nnitrogen application rates, and land use changes had the po-\ntential to\
    \ significantly affect nitrogen losses on the Walnut \nCreek watershed in Iowa,\
    \ and Kang et al. [244] were suc-\ncessful in predicting and evaluating TMDLs\
    \ of total nitro-\n40    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et\
    \ al. \ngen, total phosphorus, and suspended solid for a small water-\nshed containing\
    \ rice paddies.  \nSWAT possesses components that make it a robust tool \nfor\
    \ simulating in-stream water quality dynamics, bacteria \nfate and transport,\
    \ and sediment transport [36]. A study con-\nducted by Migliaccio et al. [259]\
    \ compared SWAT’s in-\nstream water quality component with QUAL2E, USEPA’s \n\
    well-known and state-of-the-art in-stream water quality \nmodel. Both options\
    \ were used to simulate the movement of \ntotal phosphorous (P) and nitrate/nitrite\
    \ (N) movement on \nWar Eagle Creek watershed in Arkansas. The study revealed\
    \ \nthat there was no statistical difference between both in-\nstream water quality\
    \ modeling options. Saleh and Du [209] \nand Stewart et al. [260] also show that\
    \ SWAT predicted rea-\nsonable results for P and N loss on the Bosque River water-\n\
    shed in Texas. Chu et al. [261] evaluated SWAT on the \nWarner Creek watershed\
    \ in Maryland and generated simula-\ntion results for sediment loads which agreed\
    \ strongly with \nyearly measured values. Other studies [248, 250, 262-265] \n\
    on SWAT simulation of sediment loading on different water-\nsheds also generated\
    \ comparable results. In Missouri, for \nexample, Benham et al. [266] used SWAT\
    \ to determine the \nbacteria sources and assess which BMPs can reduce the bac-\n\
    teria on a watershed in Missouri. Similar results [267, 268] \nfrom other studies\
    \ also highlight the usefulness of SWAT in \nbacteria fate and transport.  \n\
    The examples presented here have highlighted the flexi-\nbility and robustness\
    \ of SWAT. Despite these strengths, \nSWAT possesses a number of weaknesses, notably\
    \ the use of \nnon-spatial aspects of HRUs [6, 36]. As a result, Gassman et \n\
    al. [36] note that this does not allow SWAT to provide an \nexplicit spatial representation\
    \ of riparian buffer zones, wet-\nlands, and other BMPs. In addition, there is\
    \ limited ability to \naccount for targeted placement of grassland or other land\
    \ use \nand ignore flow and pollutant routing within a given subwa-\ntershed.\
    \ Like ANPS and AnnANPS, SWAT also utilizes the \ncurve number (CN) method and\
    \ faces the same limitations \nidentified earlier by Beven [186-188]. Borah and\
    \ Bera [171] \nalso report that SWAT does not simulate single-event storms \n\
    adequately.  \nWater Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) \nWEPP [269] is a process-based,\
    \ distributed, continuous, \nerosion prediction model. It is applicable to hillslope\
    \ erosion \nprocesses (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the \n\
    hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. The \nprimary intention\
    \ of the model is to evaluate the effects of \nfarming and land use on soil erosion\
    \ and sediment delivery \nfor small, agricultural field-sized watersheds (up to\
    \ 2.59x106 \nm2). WEPP has been used in a wide range of applications, \nincluding\
    \ runoff mapping [270], sediment analysis [271], \nand modeling the transport\
    \ of pathogenic microorganisms \n[272]. Another example of the WEPP application\
    \ was fo-\ncused on the connection between soil sediment and microbial \ntransport\
    \ [272]. It was determined that areas with clay soils \ncontribute more to contamination\
    \ of water supplies by mi-\ncroorganisms than those with sandy soils. It was also\
    \ sug-\ngested that the leading factors are hydraulic conductivity, \nrainfall\
    \ intensity, and topographic slope. Similar efforts \ncould be performed on organic\
    \ chemicals that may adhere to \ndiffering soil types and be transported through\
    \ the watershed. \nA computer interface (Erosion Database Interface, EDI) \nwas\
    \ created by van Lier et al. [273] to process the surface \nhydrology output from\
    \ WEPP into a georeferenced estima-\ntion of runoff. This tool allowed for improved\
    \ management \nof agriculture and can be used to assess crop management \ntechniques\
    \ [270]. WEPP was used, along with the Universal \nSoil Loss Equation, sediment\
    \ rating curves, and other model-\ning techniques to develop a sediment budget\
    \ for the Murder-\nCreekBasin in Georgia. From the study, researchers found \n\
    that unstable streambanks, mobile streambeds, and turbidity \ncurrently observed\
    \ in the area were the result of poor farm-\ning practices from the early 1900s\
    \ [271].  \nWATERSHED MODELING SYSTEMS \nThere are numerous watershed-scale hydrologic\
    \ model-\ning systems available that utilize some of the models men-\ntioned previously\
    \ within one packaged system for watershed \nmanagement. This section briefly\
    \ describes some of the sys-\ntems more commonly used today. A summary of the\
    \ water-\nshed model systems considered and their properties is pro-\nvided in\
    \ Table 2. \nAutomated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool \n(AGWA) \nAGWA is\
    \ a GIS-based tool for watershed modeling cre-\nated through a joint project between\
    \ the USDA-ARS South-\nwest Watershed Research Center and the U.S. EPA Office\
    \ of \nResearch and Development [274]. Embedded in AGWA are \nthe KINEROS and\
    \ SWAT models. Digital elevation models \n(DEMs) are used to delineate and discretize\
    \ the watersheds. \nThen, soil, land cover, and precipitation data layers are\
    \ used \nto derive model input parameters. Subsurface hydrologic \ndata from Walnut\
    \ Gulch Experimental Watershed were used \nto calibrate and validate AGWA.  \n\
    AGWA is used by scientists and natural resource manag-\ners to investigate the\
    \ impacts of land cover change on runoff, \nerosion, and water quality. Most applications\
    \ of AGWA in-\nvolve analysis of future sediment loading and runoff to assist\
    \ \nin decision support. Hernandez et al. [214] demonstrated this \napplication\
    \ by using AGWA with ATtILA, a landscape as-\nsessment tool, to analyze the spatial\
    \ effects of human-\ninduced landscape changes on runoff volume and soil ero-\n\
    sion in the San Pedro River Basin, a semi-arid area. Within \nAGWA, SWAT was used\
    \ for modeling of runoff and erosion \nsimulations. The basin was divided into\
    \ sub catchments for \nanalysis, which were further divided into hydrological\
    \ re-\nsponse units (HRUs) to develop relationships between land \ncover and sediment\
    \ yield. Agricultural areas were found to \nhave the greatest contribution to\
    \ sediment yield. Subcatch-\nments and HRUs were ranked in order of sediment loading\
    \ \nwith those contributing the most sediment considered “sensi-\ntive areas.”\
    \ This application provides resource managers \nwith capability to identify problem\
    \ areas by applying a spa-\ntial approach to sediment and runoff modeling [214].\
    \ An-\nother example of AGWA’s use for management decision \nsupport was performed\
    \ by Kepner et al. [275]. Three scenar-\nios for future urbanization of the Upper\
    \ San Pedro River \nBasin were evaluated for surface runoff, sediment yield, \n\
    channel discharge, and percolation using SWAT within \nAGWA. While all three scenarios\
    \ yielded negative impacts \non the basin, the Open Scenario, which consists of\
    \ a popula-\ntion increase greater than currently forecasted and highly \nWatershed\
    \ Modeling and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5  \
    \  41 \nunrestricted land development, resulted in a worst case out-\ncome [275].\
    \ Similar applications can be employed to assist \nstakeholders and management\
    \ in decision support for land \ndevelopment planning. \nBetter Assessment Science\
    \ Integrating Point and Non-\npoint Sources (BASINS) \nFirst released in 1996\
    \ by the USEPA, the Better Assess-\nment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint\
    \ Sources (BA-\nSINS) software system was intended to serve as a multipur-\npose\
    \ environmental analysis system focused on evaluating \nboth point and nonpoint\
    \ sources of pollutant loading in wa-\ntersheds [211]. A specific intended use\
    \ of BASINS is fo-\ncused on evaluation and development of Total Maximum \nDaily\
    \ Loads (TMDLs). It is capable of performing watershed \nand water quality-based\
    \ studies on regional, state, and local \nlevels. The system includes utilities\
    \ for data management \nand extraction, watershed delineation, watershed assessment\
    \ \ntools, and a group of watershed models including WinHSPF, \nPollutant Load\
    \ Application (PLOAD), Aquatic Ecostystem \nand Toxicity Model (AQUATOX), and\
    \ AGWA which in-\ncludes KINEROS and SWAT. The current version, BASINS \n4.0,\
    \ includes an open-source, free GIS software architecture, \nMapWindow [276].\
    \  \nBASINS has been used for pollutant loading of the Sea-\nmangeum watershed\
    \ in Korea, specifically focused on BOD, \ntotal nitrogen, and total phosphorous.\
    \ Jeon et al. [277], in \ntesting the applicability of WinHSPF within BASINS,\
    \ found \nthat values obtained from BASINS were a bit higher than \nfield observations,\
    \ but were considered within an acceptable \nrange to accept the model as a good\
    \ choice for Korean appli-\ncations. In another study for the New York Department\
    \ of \nEnvironment and Conservation (NYDEC), BASINS was \nconsidered for use in\
    \ development of the sediment portion of \nthe state’s TMDL plan. They found that\
    \ SWAT was easier to \nuse than HSPF, but recommend that Monte Carlo simula-\n\
    tions be conducted to provide more accurate values [278]. \nBoth studies indicated\
    \ that results were less than perfect, but \nwithin acceptable boundaries.  \n\
    MODFLOW-Watershed \nHydrology \nand \nTransport \n(MODFLOW-WHaT) \nMODFLOW-WHaT\
    \ is a recent addition to the watershed \nmodeling portfolio. The system is the\
    \ result of a Master’s \nThesis research of Brad Thoms [256], where the Center\
    \ for \nGroundwater Research at Oregon Health and Science Uni-\nversity currently\
    \ sponsors/maintains MODLFLOW-WHAT. \nThe package provides fully coupled, 3D simulation\
    \ of sur-\nface-subsurface interactions through use of Richard’s Equa-\ntion,\
    \ 2D kinematic flow approximations for overland flow, \nand an adaptive time-stepping\
    \ algorithm. Open-channel flow \ncalculations are performed using Diffusion Analogy\
    \ Surface-\nWater Flow Model (DAFLOW) with water quality modeled \nusing RT3D\
    \ and Branched Lagrangian Transport Model \n(BLTM) [279].  \nLittle is known about\
    \ the benefits of using the system be-\nyond the comparison made by Thoms [280]\
    \ to work done by \nJohnson and colleagues [281]. Johnson’s work involved us-\n\
    ing MODFLOW-SURFACT to evaluate the impacts of daily \nprecipitation and location\
    \ within a watershed on the occur-\nrence of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) in\
    \ groundwaters of \nsemi-arid regions [281]. In the between the two MODFLOW \n\
    packages, it was found that MODFLOW-WHaT more accu-\nrately represented the watershed’s\
    \ responses to precipitation \nevents by taking into consideration infiltration\
    \ and subsur-\nface flow that are not well represented in MODFLOW-\nSURFACT [280].\
    \ The authors are unaware of a GIS compo-\nnent to this modeling system or other\
    \ applications. \nWatershed Information System (WISE) \nDeveloped by Watershed\
    \ Concepts, WISE is a GIS-based \nsystem to manage and analyze large amounts of\
    \ water re-\nsources data. The system is primarily used for its open data \nstorage\
    \ management and formatting abilities instead of actu-\nally processing information\
    \ [282]. It is compatible with \nHEC-1, HEC-2, HEC-RAS, FLO-2D, Coastal Hydroscience\
    \ \nAnalysis, Modeling & Predictive Simulation (CHAMPS), \nWave Height Analysis\
    \ for Flood Insurance Studies \n(WHAFIS), Storm Water Management Model (SWMM),\
    \ \nand Windows Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran \n(WinHSPF) through NonPoint\
    \ Source Model (NPSM). The \nsystem includes several modules discussed below [283].\
    \ \n• Scoping module: This allows users to collect spatial \ndata and assists\
    \ in mapping for flood hazard studies.  \n• Terrain module: Terrain datasets can\
    \ be imported and \nprioritized based on user needs primarily for use in \ndrainage\
    \ studies. \n• Closed system inventory module: This calculates pipe \ncapacities,\
    \ lengths, slopes, and has capabilities for use \nwith catch basins, manholes,\
    \ and piping systems.  \n• Open system inventory module: Used for large scale\
    \ \nhydrologic and hydraulic studies, this module allows \ninput of Total Station\
    \ survey data and provides easy \nexport to the HEC-RAS model.  \n• Hydrology\
    \ module: This module assists in catchment \ndelineation and calculates Time of\
    \ Concentration, \nstage/storage curves and SCS curve numbers. It also \ncan function\
    \ as a pre-processor for HEC-1 and TR-20 \nmodels.  \n• Hydraulics module: Spatial\
    \ data can be integrated to \nbuild hydraulic model input data and is used for\
    \ flood \nmap generation. \n• Water \nquality \nmodule: \nTravel \ntime \nof \n\
    spills/contamination events is computed using dis-\ntance or time interval measures\
    \ and impacted stream \nsegments are color coded. \n• Planning tools module: Aerial\
    \ photos can be used to \nidentify impervious surfaces which are then used to\
    \ \nestimate impact based upon parcel ownership. \n• Wastewater planning module:\
    \ Users can plan and pre-\ndict costs associated with modifying or repairing ex-\n\
    isting wastewater systems or model new systems tak-\ning into consideration costs\
    \ and population projections \n[283]. \nWISE has been used primarily as a flood\
    \ hazard mapping \ntool. USGS New Hapmshire/Vermont Water Science Center \nperformed\
    \ such a study for Carroll County, New Hampshire \n[284], where WISE was primarily\
    \ used for data collection \nand storage. The primary problems faced by those\
    \ involved \n42    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al.\
    \ \nin the project included lack of or low quality spatial data for \nmapping\
    \ the floodplains [284].  \nWatershed Modeling System (WMS) \nWatershed Modeling\
    \ System (WMS), developed by En-\nvironmental Modeling Systems, Inc. at Brigham\
    \ Young Uni-\nversity, is a comprehensive graphical modeling environment \nfor\
    \ all phases of watershed hydrology and hydraulics [197]. \nWMS includes powerful\
    \ tools to automate modeling proc-\nesses such as automated basin delineation,\
    \ geometric pa-\nrameter calculations, GIS overlay computations including \ncurve\
    \ numbers (CN), rainfall depth, roughness coefficients, \netc., and cross-section\
    \ extraction from terrain data. WMS \nprovides an interface for a variety of hydrologic\
    \ and hydrau-\nlic models within a GIS-based processing framework. Mod-\nels packaged\
    \ within the system include HEC-1, TR-20, TR-\n55, National Flood Frequency Model\
    \ (NFF), Modified Ra-\ntional Method Model (MODRAT), OC Rational, and HSPF \n\
    as hydrologic modeling components. HEC-RAS, Simplified \nDam-Break Model (SMPDBK),\
    \ and CE QUAL W2 provide \nhydraulic modeling capabilities. Gridded Surface Subsurface\
    \ \nHydraulic Analysis (GSSHA), a runoff and infiltration \nmodel from the U.S.\
    \ Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nEngineering and Research Development Center\
    \ (ERDC), is \nalso included for 2-D integrated hydrology modeling with \ngroundwater\
    \ interactions. Additional calculations include use \nof the rational method to\
    \ compute peak flows primarily for \nsmall rural watersheds [197]. \nTypical applications\
    \ involve use of the sub-models \nwithin WMS with the overarching system used\
    \ for pre- and \npost-processing of information. An example of this is the \n\
    work done by Omer et al. [214] on evaluating the impact of \ndata resolution on\
    \ hydraulic modeling and floodplain de-\nlineation for Leith Creek in North Carolina.\
    \ Light detection \nand ranging (LIDAR) data is a highly dense but a highly \n\
    informational aerial surveying technique now being em-\nployed in GIS and hydrology\
    \ applications for actions such as \ndelineating catchments and floodplains. Redundancy\
    \ in the \ndata and the massive amounts of data obtained can be trou-\nblesome.\
    \ WMS possesses capabilities to not only utilize this \ndata in applications,\
    \ but also to filter the data to remove un-\nnecessary points. The researchers\
    \ filtered the LIDAR data at \ndifferent levels and then compared HEC-RAS results\
    \ using \neach of the filtered data sets. WMS provided a platform for \nperforming\
    \ the analysis. It was found that filtering of the \ndata improved processing\
    \ time without compromising results \nwith the optimal filter level of at degrees\
    \ [285].  \nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN WATERSHED MOD-\nELING \nWatershed modeling\
    \ involves a comprehensive examina-\ntion of contaminant transport across different\
    \ features found \non the surface and in the subsurface, including the interfaces\
    \ \nbetween. Specific research and advances are focused on sub-\ncomponents of\
    \ watershed modeling. Other areas for future \nconsideration include development\
    \ of guidelines for discern-\ning minimum data resolution requirements, improved\
    \ under-\nstanding of scale-up issues and relationships, and develop-\nment of\
    \ threshold area guidelines for stream network devel-\nopment. Horn et al. [286]\
    \ also suggest that future advance-\nments should include additional capabilities\
    \ to evaluate river \nwater quality such as biological interactions (beyond that\
    \ \ncurrently done for TMDLs]. Research is currently underway \nto address several\
    \ of these needs in watershed modeling. A \nfew notable examples are illustrated\
    \ below.  \nThe U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers\
    \ (USACE) have conducted several re-\nsearch projects on improving watershed and\
    \ related model-\ning including improvements in the capabilities of existing \n\
    models. For example, the USACE Great Lakes Tributary \nModeling Program is developing\
    \ sediment transport models \nfor Great Lakes tributaries [287]. USACE has committed\
    \ to \ndeveloping more of these sediment transport models for \nother Great Lakes\
    \ tributaries [287]. USACE also intends to \ndevelop web-based tools that can\
    \ continue to support water-\nshed planning at smaller tributaries and sub-basins.\
    \ This di-\nrection can potentially lead to the application of sub models \nin\
    \ a more flexible format such as integration with Internet \nGIS tools. Research\
    \ at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nCoastal Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL) is\
    \ also developing \nimproved sub-models. For example, parameter estimation \n\
    methodologies are being used to enhance existing HEC-\nHMS automated parameter\
    \ estimation capabilities [288]. \nAdditional research is also being done to investigate\
    \ the use \nof artificial neural networks for forecasting streamflows and \nrainfall-runoff\
    \ on watersheds [12, 16, 289, 290]. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe ability to deliver reliable\
    \ water resources to a grow-\ning population and effectively forecast flooding,\
    \ drought, \nand surface/groundwater water contamination represent in-\ncreasingly\
    \ difficult and interrelated challenges to water re-\nsource managers, engineers,\
    \ and researchers. Such chal-\nlenges necessitate the employment of a more holistic\
    \ ap-\nproach that is capable of examining individual processes and \nsystems\
    \ and the interface between them. This paper identi-\nfied and reviewed current\
    \ technologies and issues involved \nwith performing hydrologic modeling at the\
    \ watershed scale. \nThe topics presented include an observed shift to a more\
    \ \nholistic, watershed-based focus of the regulatory community, \nvarious types\
    \ of watershed-scale models and watershed \nmodeling systems available today,\
    \ use of artificial intelli-\ngence in modeling processes, and issues faced through\
    \ scale-\nup of hydrologic processes and data resolution. The benefits \nof using\
    \ these techniques include the ability to assist water \nresource and watershed\
    \ managers with a variety of applica-\ntions such as evaluating and developing\
    \ TMDLs. Tables 1 \nand 2 provide a summary of watershed-scale models and \nmodeling\
    \ systems reviewed in this paper. Water resource \nmanagers and decision makers\
    \ can employ this summary to \ncompare models and also use as a screening tool\
    \ for select-\ning a watershed model for a specific purpose.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\

    Get rights and content Abstract The Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) model with variable
    canopy resistance was evaluated to estimate evapotranspiration (ETv) from a drip-irrigated
    Merlot (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard trained on a vertical shoot-positioned (VSP)
    system. This vineyard is located in the Talca Valley, Region del Maule, Chile
    (35°25′ LS; 71°32′ LW; 125 m a.s.l). The performance of the SW model was evaluated
    using the eddy-covariance method on a 30 min time interval. Also, sub-models to
    estimate net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) were used in the SW model.
    A good agreement between observed and estimated values of Rn was found with a
    root mean square error (RMSE) of 33 W m−2 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24
    W m−2. Also, the SW model was able to estimate latent heat flux with RMSE and
    MAE of 34 and 21 W m−2, respectively. On a daily basis, results indicate that
    the SW model was able to predict the ETv with RMSE and MAE values of 0.51 and
    0.41 mm d−1, respectively. These results suggest that it is possible to directly
    estimate ETv over unstressed grapevines using meteorological data and soil moisture
    measurements. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Canopy
    resistanceEnergy balanceVineEvapotranspiration 1. Introduction The main viticultural
    areas of Chile have experienced more frequent droughts related to the “La Niña”-Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) events during the last 10 years (Meza et al., 2003). For this
    reason, the drip irrigation system has been widely adopted by farmers to optimize
    water application in vineyards. Additionally, drip-irrigated vineyards require
    a correct irrigation scheduling in order to maintain existing production levels
    and wine quality. A key to achieve these targets is the estimation of actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) according to nonlinear interactions of soil, vines and atmospheric conditions.
    In this regard, Sene (1994) and Ortega-Farias et al. (2007) suggested using the
    two-layer model of Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) to directly estimate ETa using
    meteorological data measured over a non-irrigated and drip-irrigated vineyard,
    respectively. Furthermore, during the last decade, the SW model has been widely
    used to estimate ETa in different types of sparse crops and climatic conditions
    (Alves and Cameira, 2002, Anadranistakis et al., 2000, Kato et al., 2004, Zhou
    et al., 2006, Gardiol et al., 2003, Fisher et al., 2005). In the SW model, ETa
    is calculated as the sum of the Penman–Monteith equation for evaporation and transpiration,
    weighted by a set of coefficients that represent the combination of soil and canopy
    resistances (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). However, the direct estimation of
    ETa is complex because vineyard water use is controlled by energy absorbed by
    vines and soil surface. Vineyards consist of widely spaced plants that allow for
    deep penetration of sunlight into the canopy. As a result, the soil contribution
    to the energy balance is considerable (Spano et al., 2000). This depends highly
    on management practices that determine vine vigour and, hence, water-use (Yunusa
    et al., 2004). The vigour of the vine is manifested through the canopy size, leaf
    area index (LAI), and fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation (fc). In
    commercial vineyards, canopy cover is generally incomplete as a result of the
    canopy geometry generated by training systems. According to canopy structure and
    vegetation coverage, sensible heat flux (H) generated at the soil surface can
    be a major contributor to the vineyard energy balance which plays a key role in
    vine transpiration and evaporation. For this reason, the incomplete canopy cover
    is considered a major cause of the relatively low rate of transpiration by grapevines
    in commercial vineyards since the majority of the incident radiation is not captured,
    but transmitted to the bare soil surface (Yunusa et al., 2004). Therefore, the
    application of the SW model for irrigation scheduling requires an adequate characterization
    of canopy geometry and training system, which control the energy absorbed by vines
    and soil surface. For a drip-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard, Ortega-Farias
    et al. (2007) indicated that the SW model simulated latent heat flux (LE) and
    ETa with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 22 W m−2 and 0.36 mm d−1, respectively.
    According to this study, the parameterization of LAI and canopy resistance is
    critical in order to increase confidence in the accuracy of the SW model. Also,
    the SW model was able to predict LE over a furrow-irrigated vineyard with a MAE
    value of 39 W m−2 (Zhang et al., 2008). Unlike to these studies, our research
    consists of evaluating the application of SW model to directly simulate LE and
    ETa using weather data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar
    radiation) generated by an automatic meteorological station installed over a drip-irrigated
    Merlot vineyard. Also, this study includes the evaluation of a sub-model for estimating
    the net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) using only conventional meteorological
    data. Finally, the canopy resistance was simulated using weather information in
    combination with soil water content measurements in the root-zone, and soil surface
    resistance was calculated only as a function of soil water content in the top
    layer of soil. 2. Theory The daytime and nighttime variation of latent heat flux
    from vine transpiration and soil evaporation is computed by the following expressions
    (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985): (1) (2) (3) where ETv = actual evapotranspiration
    over a vineyard (mm d−1); λ = latent heat of vaporization (J kg−1); LE = latent
    heat flux from vineyard (W m−2); T = latent heat flux from vine transpiration
    (W m−2); E = latent heat flux from soil evaporation (W m−2); Cc = canopy resistance
    coefficient; Cs = soil surface resistance coefficient; Δ = slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure curve at the mean temperature (kPa K−1); A = available energy leaving
    the complete canopy (W m−2); cp = specific heat of the air at constant pressure
    (1013 J kg−1 K1); ρa = air density (kg m−3); D = water vapor pressure deficit
    at the reference height (kPa); ; As = available energy at the soil surface (W
    m−2); ; γ = psychrometric constant (kPa K−1); ; ; and . 3. Materials and methods
    3.1. General description The experiment was conducted during the 2006/2007 and
    2007/2008 growing seasons on a drip-irrigated commercial Merlot (Vitis vinifera
    L.) vineyard located in the Talca Valley, Región del Maule, Chile (35°25′ LS;
    71°32′ LW; 125 m a.s.l.). The climate in this area is a typical Mediterranean
    semiarid climate with an average daily temperature of 17.1 °C between September
    and March (between spring and summer periods). Average annual rainfall in the
    region is about 676 mm falling mainly during the winter months. The summer period
    is usually dry (2.2% of annual rainfall) and hot while the spring is on average
    wet (16% of annual rainfall). The soil at the vineyard is classified as the Talca
    series (family Fine, mixed, thermic Ultic Haploxeralfs) with a clay loam texture.
    For the effective rooting depth (0–60 cm), the volumetric soil water content at
    field capacity (θFC) and at wilting point (θWP) were 0.36 m3 m−3 (216 mm) and
    0.22 m3 m−3 (132 mm), respectively. The management allowed depletion (MAD) was
    29% (174 mm), which corresponded to a normalized soil water content value (F4)
    of 0.51. The Merlot vines were planted in 1999 in north-south rows 2.5 m apart,
    with 1.5 m within-row spacing. The vines were trained on a vertical shoot-positioned
    (VSP) system with a foliage height of 2.0 m and canopy width of 0.5 m. The canopy
    geometry of this training system was similar to a parallelepiped which was conserved
    after bloom (about mid-November) by hedging two or three times during the summer.
    Typical vine trunk diameters were about 11.7 cm (±0.8 cm) and soil surface was
    maintained free of weeds or cover crop during the experiment. 3.2. Irrigation
    management and plant measurements Irrigation water was delivered twice a week
    in the morning using 4.0 L h−1 drippers spaced at intervals of 1.5 m along the
    rows. Weekly measurements of soil water content (θi) at the rooting depth (0–60
    cm) were taken using a portable TDR unit (TRASE, Soil Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara,
    CA) with 12 pairs of rods inserted below the drippers. Also, the volumetric soil
    water content (θg) in the top layer of soil (0–20 cm) was measured under vine
    canopy (4 points) and between rows (6 points). The average value of θg was weighted
    by a fractional cover of 0.3 which was estimated by measuring dimension of canopy
    10 times during each season. Vine water status was evaluated using the midday
    stem water potential (ψx) measured with a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment,
    Santa Barbara, CA). ψx was measured on 12 fully expanded leaves, wrapped in aluminum
    foil and encased in plastic bags at least 2 h before measurement. Stomatal resistance
    (rst) was measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer (model LI-6400, LI-COR,
    Lincoln, NE). Measurements of ψx and rst were done at midday (approximately 11:00–14:00
    h) from sunlit and shaded leaves situated on both sides of the vine rows. Leaf
    area index (LAI) was estimated as a function of the shoot length which was correlated
    with its total leaf area (Ortega-Farias et al., 2007): (4) (5) where LAsh = total
    leaf area per shoot (cm2); Av = area of vines (cm2); i = total shoot number per
    vine; and Lsh = shoot length (cm). To develop the correlation between LAsh and
    Lsh, leaves of each shoot were scanned so that leaf area was measured using an
    image analysis. On four vines the total shoot length per vine was measured once
    a week during the experiment. 3.3. Energy balance measurements An automatic weather
    system was installed at the Merlot vineyard to measure energy balance components
    and meteorological variables at 30-min interval. Wind speed (u) and wind direction
    were monitored by a cup anemometer and a wind vane (03101-5, Young, Michigan,
    USA) and precipitation (Pp) was measured by a rain gauge (A730RAIN, Adcon Telemetry,
    Austria). Air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RHa) were measured using
    a Vaisala probe (model HMP45C). Net radiation (Rn), incoming (Rsi) and outgoing
    (Rso) solar radiation were measured by a four-way net radiometer (CNR1, Kipp&Zonen
    Inc., Delft, Netherlands). Sensors of u, , Pp, Ta, RHa, Rn, Rsi, and Rso were
    installed at 4.7 m above the soil surface. Also a Vaisala probe for measuring
    temperature (Tc) and relative humidity (RHc) within canopy was installed inside
    the foliage at 1.6 m above the soil surface. Rn at the soil surface was measured
    by a Fritchen type net radiometer (REBS-Q7, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT) at a 0.5
    m height. Additionally, the sensor inter-comparison over a grass surface indicated
    that differences between the CNR1 and REBS-Q7 were less than 30 W m−2, which is
    within sensor accuracy. Latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) were
    measured using an eddy-covariance (EC) system mounted at a height of 4.7 m and
    oriented towards the predominant wind direction (South). The system consisted
    of a fast response open-path infrared gas analyzer (LI-7500 IRGA; LI-COR, Inc.,
    Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) and a three dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT, Campbell
    Sci., Logan, UT). The minimum fetch-to-instrument-height ratio was about 200:1,
    sufficiently large to preclude horizontal advection. Also, estimates of LE from
    the LI-7500 IRGA were corrected for air density (Webb et al., 1980), and H estimates
    were corrected for sonic temperature (Schotanus et al., 1983). LE and H measurements
    were made at 10 Hz, and means, standard deviations, and covariances were calculated
    for 30-min periods by Reynolds block averaging. Soil heat flux was estimated using
    eight flux plates installed on either side of the rows (6 and 2 plates into the
    inter-row and below row, respectively). This arrangement takes into account the
    row shade effect during the course of the day. The flux plates of constant thermal
    conductivity (HFT3, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT) were placed at a 0.08 m depth (d).
    Also, two averaging thermocouple probes (TCAV, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT) to measure
    soil temperature (Tsoil) were installed above each flux plate at depths of 0.02
    and 0.06 m. At each position, the soil heat flux was calculated by adding the
    measured flux at 0.08 m to the heat stored (S) in the layer above the heat flux
    plates. Values of S are given by: (6) where ρb = soil bulk density (1600 kg m−3);
    ρw = density of water (1000 kg m−3); Cd = specific heat capacity of soil (890
    J kg−1 K−1); Cw = specific heat capacity of the soil water (4190 J kg−1 K−1);
    ΔTsoil = change in soil temperature (K); Δt = time intervals (s). Half-hour averages
    of all signals were recorded on an electronic datalogger (CR 5000, Campbell Sci.,
    Logan, UT). Every 15 days, soil evaporation (E) was measured with microlysimeters
    which were made from PVC tubes of 75 mm i.d. and 150 mm in length (Yunusa et al.,
    2004). Four microlysimeters were installed on either side of the vines into the
    inter-row and two microlysimeters were installed within the drip-line (one below
    drip and the other one between drippers). 3.4. Data quality control Wilson et
    al. (2002) indicated that the eddy correlation (EC) system could present systematic
    errors in the measurements of turbulent energy fluxes (LE and H). Therefore, it
    is very important to avoid systematic energy imbalances and errors in the direct
    EC measurements used for model validations. For this reason, entire days that
    clearly exhibited persistent noisy behavior due to instrumental problems, flow
    distortion through the tower, or adverse meteorological conditions (for example
    rainy days) were discarded. For this reason, days that presented an energy balance
    ratio (EBR) of (H + LE) to (Rn − G) between 0.90 and 1.10 were excluded for the
    validation model. Major problems were associated with power failure and 46 days
    were eliminated for the 2-year data set when EBR values were <0.90 or >1.10. Also,
    when 5 or more of the 48 observations were missing, that day of data was excluded.
    If fewer than five observations were missing, data were linearly interpolated
    to complete the time series (Brotzge and Crawford, 2003, Laubach and Teichmann,
    1999). In this case, most of the interpolations were applied during the early
    morning and late afternoon, especially on cloudy days. Data were collected from
    November 15 (Day of year (DOY) 319) 2006 to March 15 (DOY 74) 2007 for the first
    season and October 19 (DOY 292) 2007 to February 28 (DOY 59) 2008 for the second
    season. After data quality control was applied as described above, a total of
    96 days were available for which all energy balance data (Rn, H, LE and G) were
    complete from the experimental site. However, much longer datasets were available
    for Rn, G and meteorological variables. 3.5. Parameterization of available energy
    and resistances The available energy at the crop canopy is computed as: (7) where
    Rn = net radiation above the vineyard canopy (W m−2); G = soil heat flux (W m−2).
    On 30-min intervals, values of Rn were computed as follows (Ortega-Farias et al.,
    2000): (8) where α = albedo; Rsi = incoming solar (short-wave) radiation (W m−2);
    ɛa = atmospheric emissivity; σ = Stefan–Boltzman constant (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4),
    ɛs = emissivity of the surface (0.98); Ta = air temperature (K); Ts = surface
    temperature (K). In this study, Ts was estimated from measured soil (Tsoil) and
    canopy (Tc) temperatures weighted by fractional area (fc) of vegetation (Norman
    et al., 1995, Ezzahar et al., 2007): (9) where Tsoil and Tc are in Kelvin. The
    fractional area of the vineyard was 0.30 (±0.04) and assumed constant during both
    seasons. Values of ɛa were computed from air temperature and vapor pressure as
    (Brutsaert, 1982): (10) where ew = air vapor pressure (kPa); ϕ = calibration coefficient.
    Values of ϕ were 1.51 for Rsi > 0 and 1.91 for Rsi ≤ 0. These values were suggested
    by Carrasco and Ortega-Farías (2008) for a drip-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard
    trained on the VSP system. The soil heat flux was computed as a linear function
    of Rn: (11) The intercept and slope were different from those found by Sene (1994)
    and Yunusa et al. (2004), indicating that a local calibration is necessary to
    get accurate estimates of G on half and hourly basis. It is important to indicate
    that Eq. (11) was obtained using 20 independent days which were randomly selected
    from the two growing seasons. The available energy at the soil surface was computed
    as (12) (13) where Rns = net radiation at the soil surface (W m−2); LAI = leaf
    area index (m2 m−2); C = extinction coefficient of the canopy for net radiation.
    Using daily values of Rns and Rn, the extinction coefficient was estimated as
    0.38 ± 0.05. Many studies have been conducted to estimate stomatal resistance,
    which has been generally expressed as a function of the solar radiation, water
    vapor deficit, air temperature, leaf water potential and soil moisture content
    (Anadranistakis et al., 2000, Kaufmann, 1982, Torula and Heikinheimo, 1998). Using
    the Jarvis approach, values of can be estimated by the following equations (Noilhan
    and Planton, 1989): (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) where F1, F2, F3, and F4 take into
    account the effect of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapor pressure
    deficit, air temperature, and soil water stress, respectively. rs min = minimum
    stomatal resistance (s m−1); rs max = maximum stomatal resistance (2000 s m−1);
    Rsl = threshold radiation value above which the stomata open (30 W m−2). The term
    2/LAI expresses the shading between leaves, while the factor 0.55 represents the
    PAR portion of solar radiation flux density. For this study, the daily mean value
    (from 11:00 to 14:00 h) of stomatal resistance and rs min were 216 (±54) and 144
    s m−1, respectively. The daily mean value of rs min was obtained from well-watered
    vines with ψx > −0.5 MPa (Williams and Trout, 2005). The effect of soil water
    stress on canopy resistance was calculated using the normalized soil water (F4)
    (Calvet et al., 1998, Ortega-Farias et al., 2004): (19) where θFC = volumetric
    soil moisture content at field capacity (fraction); θWP = volumetric soil moisture
    content at wilting point (fraction); θi = volumetric soil moisture content in
    the root-zone (fraction). Also, values of are given by: (20) where rb = mean boundary
    layer resistance (25 s m−1) (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). A general description
    of aerodynamic resistance, Cs and Cc is found in Shuttleworth and Wallace (1985)
    and Ortega-Farias et al. (2007). Values of and are estimated by the following
    expressions: (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) where ; ; ; ; x = reference height
    above the crop where meteorological measurements are available (4.7 m); h = canopy
    height (2.0 m); d = zero plane displacement of crop with complete canopy cover
    (0.67 h); zo = roughness length of crop with complete canopy cover (0.05 h); ;
    u = wind speed at the reference height (m s−1); k = von Kármán''s constant (0.41);
    n = eddy diffusivity decay constant in a crop with complete canopy cover (2.5).
    The soil surface is the resistance to water vapor movement from the interior to
    the soil surface and was computed as follows. (27) where ; θg = volumetric soil
    water content in the top layer of soil (0–20 cm); θs = saturated volumetric soil
    water content at the 20 cm depth (0.53 m3 m−3). Eq. (27) (with R2 = 0.67) was
    developed using measurements of E and θg from an independent data set of 20 days.
    In this case, a regression analysis was done between and θs/θg where values were
    obtained by solving Eq. (3). 3.6. Statistical analysis In order to assess the
    validity of the estimation of latent heat flux (or vineyard evapotranspiration),
    as computed from the Shuttleworth and Wallace model, our calculations were compared
    to latent heat flux measured by the eddy-covariance method. Daily and 30-min comparisons
    include the ratio (roe) of observed to estimated values, index of agreement (Ia),
    root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) (Mayer and Butler,
    1993, Willmott, 1981). Also, the Z-test was used to check whether the value of
    roe was significantly different from unity at the 95% confidence level. Similar
    statistical parameters were used to compare the observed and estimated values
    of net radiation on a 30-min and daily basis. 4. Results and discussion Skies
    were mostly clear for both seasons with daily values of Rsi and Rn between 5–35
    MJ m−2 d−1 and 4–19 MJ m−2 d−1, respectively (Fig. 1a and b). Daily mean air temperatures
    were similar during both seasons, but atmospheric conditions during the second
    season were drier than those found during the first season. In this case, maximum
    mean values of D during 2007/2008 were greater than those for 2006/2007 (Fig.
    1e and f). Also, daily mean values of u were 1.9 (±0.6) m s−1 and 0.9 (±0.5) m
    s−1 during 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, respectively (Fig. 1g and h). In both seasons,
    the top layer of soil (0–20 cm) was very dry where daily mean value of soil evaporation
    was 0.8 (±0.2) mm d−1 during the first season and 0.5 (±0.1) mm d−1 during the
    second season, according to measurements of the microlysimeters. Using the same
    measurements, Ortega-Farias et al. (2008) indicated that SW model predicted soil
    evaporation (Eq. (3)) with RMSE of 0.2 mm d−1 and vine transpiration measured
    by the sapflow method accounted for 75–80% of ETv obtained by the EC system. It
    is important to indicate that no rainfall was observed during this study and wetted
    area of the drip-irrigated vineyard was only about 3%. Rainfall amounts from DOY
    295 to DOY 62 in the first and second seasons were 34.4 and 11.6 mm, respectively.

    was evaluated using a linear regression between turbulent energy fluxes (H + LE)
    and available energy (Rn − G) (Wilson et al., 2002, Laubach and Teichmann, 1999)
    (Fig. 2). The linear regression between (H + LE) and (Rn − G) was similar for
    the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 seasons with an overall value of R2 equal to 0.96.
    The overall analysis of the selected days indicates that the intercept (15 W m−2)
    was statistically equal to zero and slope (0.96) was significantly different from
    unity, indicating that turbulent energy fluxes were lower than available energy
    by about 4%. These results indicate that the eddy-covariance method was providing
    accurate estimates of LE and H on the selected days during both seasons (Spano
    et al., 2000, Ortega-Farias et al., 2007). Also, Oliver and Sene (1992) found
    daily ratios of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy in the range of 0.9–1.2
    with average values of about 1.06 for a non-irrigated Airen vineyard. For the
    2-year data set, average values of daytime and nighttime energy balance closure
    were 15 (±40) and 18 (±15) W m−2, respectively. However, R2 value was 0.27 for
    nighttime fluxes indicating that EC measurements were erratic. Fortunately, the
    average value of (Rn − G) during nighttime was −26 (±15) W m−2 which is within
    sensor accuracy. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. A regression analysis

    the 1:1 line. Values of ψx ranged from −0.5 to −0.9 MPa and from −0.4 to −1.0
    MPa for the 2006/2007 and the 2007/2008 season, respectively (Fig. 3). These values
    indicate that the Merlot vineyard was well irrigated and vine water status was
    adequate during both simulation periods (Williams and Trout, 2005). In this study,
    irrigation started on 08 November 2006 (DOY 312) in the first season and 19 November
    2007 (DOY 323) in the second season when the soil water content reached a value
    near MAD (F4 = 0.5) (Fig. 3). Using this irrigation strategy, the normalized soil
    water content (F4) during both seasons was between 0.35 and 0.83 (Fig. 3) and
    the Merlot vineyard received a seasonal irrigation amount of 224 mm and 215 mm
    for 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, respectively. The lowest values of F4 (0.34) and
    ψx (−1.0 MPa) were observed between 16 and 20 January 2008 (Fig. 3b) where water
    application was reduced because of pump malfunction. During both seasons, LAI
    was less than 0.8 m2 m−2 from DOY 292 to DOY 365 after which LAI was kept almost
    constant, between 1.0 and 1.22 m2 m−2, until harvest by mechanical trimming (Fig.
    4). Under these irrigation and canopy managements, daily mean values of canopy
    resistance (Eq. (13)) ranged between 250 and 567 s m−1 for LAI < 1.0 m2 m−2 and
    between 131 and 250 s m−1 for LAI > 1.0 (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size

    to 15:00 h) and leaf area index (LAI) for a drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard. Fig.
    5 shows that daily values of Rn and Rso accounted for 37–57 and 16–21% of Rsi,
    respectively, during both simulation periods. For these periods, a daily mean
    albedo of 0.19 was used to compute daytime variation of net radiation (Eq. (8)).
    Pieri and Gaudillère (2003) indicated that vineyard albedo depends on the geometrical
    dimensions (ratio of row spacing (R) to canopy height (r)), shape of rows, and
    row azimuth. These authors computed an α value = 0.20 for a traditional vineyard
    in Bordeaux (one single vertical plane of foliage of nearly rectangular shape)
    with a ratio of R to r equal to 1.1. For a non-irrigated Airen vineyard grown
    on free standing bushes, Sene (1994) indicated that daily mean albedo was 0.27
    and hourly average values dropped as low as 0.18. For an Italian vineyard grown
    on a trellis system, Vieira de Azevedo et al. (1997) found that daily mean values
    of albedo changed from 0.18 in the first days after bud shooting to 0.23 after
    blooming, falling to 0.20 in the period of fruit development. Also, Fig. 5 shows
    that the mean ratio of G to Rn was less than 0.026, indicating that soil heat
    flux did not significantly affect the vineyard energy balance on a daily basis.
    Similarly, Yunusa et al. (2004) and Trambouze et al. (1998) on Sultana and Shiraz
    vineyards, respectively, indicated that daily G accounted for 8–11% of Rn. On
    the other hand, Heilman et al. (1996) reported that G was about 29% of Rn for
    a Chardonnay vineyard. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Daily ratios
    of outgoing solar radiation (Rso) and net radiation (Rn) to incoming solar radiation
    (Rsi) for a drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard. Also, daily ratio of soil heat flux
    (G) to Rno are included. Results indicate that there was good agreement between
    observed (Rno) and estimated (Rne) values of net radiation during both the 2006/2007
    and 2007/2008 season with similar values of RMSE, MAE, and Ia (Table 1). On a
    30-min basis, overall values of Ia, RMSE and MAE were 0.99, 33 W m−2 and 24 W
    m−2, respectively. The Z-test indicated that the value of roe was not significantly
    different from 1.0, suggesting that values of Rne and Rno were similar. However,
    Fig. 6 indicates that the Rn model tended to overestimate for Rno > 600 W m−2
    and underestimate for Rno < 200 W m−2, especially during the second season. Daily
    comparison indicated that Rn model during 2007/2008 presented a better performance
    than that during 2006/2007 season (Table 1). Major departures from the 1:1 line
    were observed on cloudy days that presented daily values of net radiation less
    than 6 MJ m−2 d−1 (or 2.4 mm d−1) (Fig. 7a). The greater disagreements were observed
    on DOY 74, which presented a Rn/Rsi ratio of 0.54. On this day, maximum difference
    between Rne and Rno were 105 W m−2 and 5 MJ m−2 d−1 on a 30-min and daily basis,

    analysis indicates that the model was able to simulate daily net radiation with
    overall values of RMSE and MAE equal to 1.3 and 0.95 MJ m−2 d−1, respectively.
    For both simulation periods, the roe values were statistically different from
    1.0 suggesting that the model underestimated net radiation with an error of 6%.
    Similar results have been reported by Carrasco and Ortega-Farías (2008) in a drip-irrigated
    Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard, where the Rn model showed the largest errors under
    cloudy atmospheric conditions with maximum MAE and RMSE values equivalent to 40
    and 61 W m−2, respectively. According to Brotzge and Deuchon (2000) and Brotzge
    and Crawford (2003), the probable causes of potential errors in the estimation
    of Rn on cloudy days were associated with the parameterization of the air emissivity,
    which depends on vapor pressure and air temperature at the reference level. Also,
    Ezzahar et al. (2007) and Ortega-Farias et al. (2000) indicated that the use of
    the Brutsaert''s formula may create an important scatter for low values of net
    radiation. A good comparison between observed (LEo) and estimated (LEe) values
    of LE was observed for the Merlot vineyard during the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008
    seasons (Fig. 8). Similar values of Ia, RMSE and MAE were found for both simulation
    periods, but the roe value for 2006/2007 was lower than that for 2007/2008 (Table
    2). Results of the Z-test indicate that roe value was significantly different
    from 1.0, suggesting that the SW model tended to underestimate and overestimate
    during the first and second season, respectively. The overall analysis indicated
    that the SW model overestimated latent heat flux with RMSE and MAE by 34 and 21
    W m−2, respectively. On a daily basis, the performance of the SW model was similar
    during the two seasons with RMSE values< 0.55 mm d−1 (Table 2). The overall analysis
    suggested that the SW model was able to simulate ETv with Ia and RMSE of 0.88
    and 0.51 mm d−1 (1.25 MJ m−2 d−1), respectively. It is important to indicate that
    differences between Rno and Rne did not significantly affect the performance of
    the SW model for simulating ETv on cloudy days (Fig. 7). For cloudy days, observed
    (LEo) and estimated (LEe) values of LE were less than 100 W m−2 (Fig. 9a and b)
    and the SW model was able to predict ETv with RMSE values less than 15 W m−2.
    Fig. 9c and d illustrates that values of Rno were greater than those of Rne during
    nighttime and daytime, but differences between estimated (ETve) and observed values
    (ETvo) of vineyard evapotranspiration were 0.5 and 0.35 mm d−1 for DOY 74 and
    DOY 361, respectively. Also, values of turbulent energy fluxes and available energy
    were very close and albedo ranged between 0.17 and 0.21 from 11:00 to 14:00 h.

    best agreement between LEo and LEe was observed on DOY 40 (2007/2008) (Fig. 10b),
    where the maximum values of Ta and D were 28 °C and 2.61 kPa, respectively. Also,
    the daily Rn/Rsi ratio was 0.48 and albedo ranged between 0.17 and 0.20 from 10:00
    to 18:00 h. On DOY 40, the roe was not significantly different from unity, indicating
    that values of LEo were similar to those of LEe. In this case, RMSE and MAE values
    were less than 20 W m−2. Fig. 10d indicates that Rno and Rne presented a similar
    pattern during the day, but values of Rne were greater than those of Rno from
    13:00 to 15:00 h. Also, values of turbulent energy fluxes (H + LEo) were close
    to available energy (Rno − Go) during daytime and nighttime with value of energy
    balance residue (Reb = Rno − Go − H − LEo) ranging between −53 and 58 W m−2 (Fig.
    10f). On DOY 40, daily values of ETvo and ETve were 3.4 and 3.5 mm d−1, respectively
    and accounted for 58% of Rn. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Observed

    a reference. Greatest disagreements between LEo and LEe were observed on DOY 363
    (Fig. 10a) where the SW model tended to underestimate latent heat flux over the
    Merlot vineyard under clear sky conditions (Rn/Rsi ratio = 0.55 and albedo = 0.19).
    Under these conditions, the maximum values of Ta and D were 31.2 °C and 2.94 kPa,
    respectively (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Also, soil surface on DOY 363 was wetted by rainfall
    (17.2 mm) observed on DOY 358. Major disagreements were observed between 12:00
    and 20:00 h, where values of u were between 4.7 and 7.1 m s−1 (Fig. 1g). RMSE
    value was 102 W m−2 with a maximum difference between LEo and LEe of 197 W m−2.
    Daily values of ETvo and ETve were 5.1 and 3.7 mm d−1, respectively, for the vineyard
    with a midday stem water potential of −0.59 MPa. Also, a good energy balance closure
    was observed on DOY 363 where daytime values of Rne and Rno were similar, except
    at midday. In general, the greatest disagreements were observed on clear days
    after rainfall, especially under high atmospheric demand for water vapor. A similar
    study was done by Ortega-Farias et al. (2007) who indicated that the SW model
    was able to simulate latent heat flux (LE) over a drip-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon
    vineyard under dry atmospheric conditions with a root mean square error (RMSE)
    and mean absolute error (MAE) of 29 and 22 W m−2, respectively. Also, this study
    indicated that the SW model was very sensitive to errors in leaf area index and
    mean stomatal resistance, but it was not affected by errors in the estimation
    of aerodynamic resistances. Recently, Zhang et al. (2008) indicated that the SW
    model simulated LE over a furrow-irrigated vineyard (fc = 0.35) with MAE of 39
    W m−2. In this study, the parameterization for the SW model was so well defined
    that, under dry soil conditions, the only input data required were direct measurements
    of climatic variables (Ta, u, RHa and Rsi), soil water content and leaf area index.
    It is important to acknowledge that the parameterization of Rn, G, and depend
    on the training system, irrigation system and vine water status. The training
    system affects the vine vigor which is manifested through the canopy size, leaf
    area index (LAI), and fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation (fc). Therefore
    training systems have a substantial effect on soil energy balances, mainly by
    changing the partitioning of vineyard net radiation into its soil and canopy components
    (Heilman et al., 1996). According to canopy structure and vegetation coverage,
    sensible heat flux (H) generated at the soil surface can be a major contributor
    to the vineyard energy balance which plays a key role in vine transpiration and
    evaporation. For the drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard, canopy cover was generally
    incomplete as a result of the regimented structure imposed by the VSP system.
    This training system consists of widely spaced vines that allow for deep penetration
    of sunlight and air turbulence into the canopy. A constant shape of the canopy
    (a parallelepiped) was maintained with LAI ranging between 0.8 and 1.22 m2 m−2and
    fc values of 0.3 (±0.04) during the two growing seasons, especially after full
    bloom. Under this constant shape, daily ratios of Rso to Rsi were quite constant
    (α = 0.19 ± 0.023), allowing a good performance of the Rn model during the two
    study periods. Also, during these two seasons, the top layer of soil (0–20 cm)
    was very dry and soil surface wetted by drip emitters was 3%. Under this canopy
    and soil water conditions, the soil contribution to the vineyard energy balance
    is considerable, especially under high atmospheric demand for water vapor. Under
    these atmospheric conditions, soil surfaces of a drip-irrigated vineyard could
    produce more sensible heat flux than that of a flood-irrigated vineyard because
    wetted surfaces are less than 3% of the total area of the vineyard. Consequently,
    soil heating that increases H depends on training and irrigation system. The parameterization
    of Rn, G, and seems adequate for the drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard trained on
    VSP, but further study is required for overhead systems (fc = 1) that completely
    shade the ground. In this case, the vineyard canopy of the overhead system behaves
    as a big-leaf and a one-layer model such as Penman–Monteith could be applied to
    simulate ETv (Rana and Katerji, 2008). Finally, values of midday steam water potential
    indicated that the Merlot vineyard was well irrigated during both simulation periods.
    Under these conditions, the Jarvis model, without any local calibration, seems
    correct for the unstressed Merlot vines. However, a calibration of Javis model
    could be required for vineyards under moderate or severe water stress. 5. Conclusions
    The SW model was successfully validated with LE and ETv measured from an eddy
    correlation system installed over a drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard under well-irrigated
    conditions. In this regard, the SW model simulated latent heat flux at 30-min
    intervals with a RMSE and MAE of 34 and 21 W m−2, respectively. For the vineyard
    evapotranspiration, RMSE was 0.51 mm d−1 and MAE was 0.41 mm d−1. In addition,
    the index of agreement was 97% and 88% for LE and ETv, respectively. These results
    suggest that it is possible to directly estimate ETv using meteorological information
    in combination with soil moisture measurements. However, It is important to acknowledge
    that the parameterization of SW model depends on the training system, irrigation
    system and vine water status. Future research will be centered on the effect of
    the training system and vine water status on the parameterization of Rn, G, and
    . Also, we will explore the application of remote sensing to simulate the ground
    surface area cover which depends on vine vigor and canopy geometry. Acknowledgements

    \ 2015 \n \nAbstract: A new procedure is proposed for estimating actual basal\
    \ crop coefficients from \nvegetation indices (Kcb VI) considering a density coefficient\
    \ (Kd) and a crop coefficient for \nbare soil. Kd is computed using the fraction\
    \ of ground cover by vegetation (fc VI), which is \nalso estimated from vegetation\
    \ indices derived from remote sensing. A combined approach \nfor estimating actual\
    \ crop coefficients from vegetation indices (Kc VI) is also proposed by \nintegrating\
    \ the Kcb VI with the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke) derived from the soil\
    \ water \nbalance model SIMDualKc. Results for maize, barley and an olive orchard\
    \ have shown that \nthe approaches for estimating both fc VI and Kcb VI compared\
    \ well with results obtained using \nthe SIMDualKc model after calibration with\
    \ ground observation data. For the crops studied, \nthe correlation coefficients\
    \ relative to comparing the actual Kcb VI and Kc VI with actual Kcb \nand Kc obtained\
    \ with SIMDualKc were larger than 0.73 and 0.71, respectively. The \ncorresponding\
    \ regression coefficients were close to 1.0. The methodology herein presented\
    \ \nand discussed allowed for obtaining information for the whole crop season,\
    \ including periods \nwhen vegetation cover is incomplete, as the initial and\
    \ development stages. Results show that \nthe proposed methods are adequate for\
    \ supporting irrigation management. \n \n \nOPEN ACCESS\nRemote Sens. 2015, 7\

    \ of crop water requirements plays an important role in the improvement of \n\
    crops water use and irrigation performance. This issue is particularly relevant\
    \ considering the need for \nintensification of irrigated agriculture and increased\
    \ water scarcity in several regions of the world. \nA common approach for the\
    \ estimation of crop water requirements is the Kc-ETo approach adopted \nby FAO56\
    \ [1] where a reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) is multiplied by a crop\
    \ coefficient (Kc) \nfor estimating crop evapotranspiration, ETc. The ETo represents\
    \ the climatic demand of the atmosphere \nwhile the Kc represents the differences\
    \ distinguishing the reference crop and the considered crop in \nterms of ground\
    \ cover, canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance, thus in terms of crop ET.\
    \ \nAlternatively, crop evapotranspiration may be computed directly from ground\
    \ observations using a \ncombination equation such as the Penman-Monteith equation\
    \ [2,3]. However, this approach is more \ndemanding than the Kc-ETo approach and\
    \ is not used for operational purposes but limited to research. \nAnother approach\
    \ for estimating crop ET is based on surface energy balance models that use remote\
    \ \nsensing thermal infrared data (e.g., [4–6]). These models estimate crop ET\
    \ by subtracting the soil heat \nflux (G) and sensible heat flux (H) from the\
    \ net radiation (Rn) at the surface. Such models allow to \ndirectly integrating\
    \ the effects related with soil water deficit or water vapor pressure in the crop\
    \ ET \nestimation [7]. Crop coefficients can be further derived considering the\
    \ ETo [8–10]. However, these \nmodels present greater complexity and larger amount\
    \ of input data than the Kc-ETo approach [7]. The \nKc-ETo approach is commonly\
    \ accepted for operational and research objectives [11]. A single or dual \nKc\
    \ approach may be used [1]. In the single approach both crop transpiration and\
    \ soil evaporation are \ntimely averaged into a single coefficient (Kc), whereas\
    \ in the dual approach a daily basal crop \ncoefficient (Kcb), representing primarily\
    \ the plant transpiration, and a daily soil evaporation coefficient \n(Ke) are\
    \ considered separately, i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke. \nFor transferability purposes,\
    \ Kc, Kcb and ETc in FAO56 represent ET rates under optimal, well-watered \nconditions\
    \ [1]. However, in the field and in common practice, crop conditions are often\
    \ not optimal \ndue to insufficient or non-uniform irrigation, crop density, soil\
    \ salinity and/or agronomic management. \nPotential ETc must then be replaced\
    \ by the actual ETc (ETc act), and the resulting Kc is renamed Kc act and \nKcb\
    \ is also renamed Kcb act [11]. The term actual is adopted in this study. As commented\
    \ by  \nPereira et al. [11], this concept better supports estimation and transferability\
    \ avoiding the need to define \nmultiple Kc values for the same crop as has occurred\
    \ in the past for several crops, e.g., vines and \norchards. Moreover, adopting\
    \ Kc act and Kcb act rather than using the potential crop coefficients allows\
    \ to \nperform irrigation management closer to the actual conditions, which is\
    \ a main motivation of the \npresent study. \nStandard, potential Kc and Kcb values\
    \ are defined and tabulated for a wide range of agricultural  \ncrops [1,12],\
    \ but appropriate corrections may be required adopting a stress coefficient (Ks)\
    \ to obtain \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2375 \n \nthe actual Kc (Kc act = Ks Kc or\
    \ Kcb act = Ks Kcb). In addition, the transferability of Kc and Kcb values \n\
    requires appropriate adjustment to local climate [1]. The adjustment of tabulated\
    \ Kc and Kcb values for \nlocal conditions is also necessary when differences\
    \ occur in planting density and geometry, vegetation \nheight, and canopy architecture\
    \ particularly in case of tree and vine crops [1,12]. \nIn the last two decades,\
    \ remote sensing (RS) data has increasingly been used for monitoring and \nmapping\
    \ the spatial and temporal variation of ET and thus for computing crop water requirements\
    \  \n(e.g., [13–15]). One of the most widely used approaches considers the relationship\
    \ between vegetation \nindices (VI) derived from RS reflectance data and (actual)\
    \ crop coefficients, either Kc or Kcb. The basis \nof this approach relies on\
    \ the close correlation of several VI and various biophysical characteristics\
    \ of \nthe plants, e.g., leaf area index (LAI), ground cover fraction (fc), biomass,\
    \ and physiological processes \ndepending on light absorption by the canopy, including\
    \ ET (e.g., [16–19]). With the VI approach, \nbecause these indices reflect the\
    \ actual vegetation cover conditions, the estimated Kc or Kcb represent \nactual\
    \ rather than potential Kc or Kcb. As proposed by Pereira et al. [11], these coefficients\
    \ should then \nbe referred to as Kc act and Kcb act despite many authors have\
    \ not adopted this conceptual difference and \nthat most VI-based methods are\
    \ unable to accurately observe reductions in Kc and Kcb caused by acute \nwater\
    \ or salinity stress. \nOne advantage of using VI-based actual crop coefficients\
    \ is the ability to account for variations in \nplant growth due to abnormal weather\
    \ conditions, e.g., the impact of a frost occurrence [20]. Using  \nVI-based crop\
    \ coefficients also allows obtaining the spatial variation of actual Kc (or Kcb)\
    \ within fields. \nIn addition they provide for a field-to-field description of\
    \ the variation of actual Kc (or Kcb) due to \nvariations in planting dates, plant\
    \ spacing and cultivars [11]. A review of the advantages and \ndisadvantages of\
    \ VI-based crop coefficients was presented by Allen et al. [21]. \nThe Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; [22]) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index\
    \ \n(SAVI; [23]) are the most commonly VI used to estimate actual Kc and Kcb.\
    \ The formulation of both \nVI combines the reflected light in the red and near\
    \ infrared (NIR) bands, thus providing an indirect \nmeasure of the absorption\
    \ of red light by chlorophylls (a and b) and reflectance of NIR by the \nmesophyll\
    \ structure in leaves [17,24]. Choudhury et al. [25] refer that using SAVI instead\
    \ of NDVI \nallows extending the range over which the VI respond to the increase\
    \ in vegetation amount/density beyond \na LAI around 3, which is related with\
    \ NDVI saturation problems for high LAI values. In addition, the \nNDVI is considered\
    \ more sensitive than SAVI to soil background reflectance changes due to the moisture\
    \ \nof soil surface [7,13,26]. \nSeveral relationships between Kcb (or Kc) and\
    \ VI are reported in the literature for different \nvegetation types, with the\
    \ most recent studies focusing the Kcb estimation because plant transpiration\
    \ is \nmore directly related with the VI. Some examples of this approach consider\
    \ a linear relationship \nbetween Kcb and NDVI [13,20,25,27,28], and between Kcb\
    \ and SAVI [13,25,26] but an exponential \nrelationship between NDVI and Kc was\
    \ also considered [29]. A few studies report a Kcb estimation \nbased on fc or\
    \ LAI obtained through VI, including for field and tree crops [7,30,31]. However,\
    \ in most \nstudies, the relationship between Kcb and VI was established for non-stressed\
    \ conditions and for \nconditions of dry soil surface, which often do not represent\
    \ the actual conditions of crop management. \nVI derived crop coefficients often\
    \ do not account for the reduction in Kcb due to water or salinity  \nstress [7,11].\
    \ Then the above referred stress coefficient Ks should be considered to obtain\
    \ an actual Kc \nor Kcb, i.e., Kc act and Kcb act [1]. Most of those studies were\
    \ established for a single crop and its \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2376 \n \napplication\
    \ for other crops, particularly for discontinuous tree crops, is still limited.\
    \ Differently, the \napproach proposed by Mateos et al. [7], which approximates\
    \ Kcb using fc and VI, refers to several \ncrops and shows good results. However,\
    \ this application does not always allow estimating Kcb for \nperiods when the\
    \ soil is not yet fully covered by the crop. \nAlthough several equations were\
    \ proposed for approaching Kcb via VI, a consensual equation that \ncan be consistently\
    \ used for different vegetation types and conditions is still lacking. In such\
    \ context, a \ndensity coefficient (Kd) [12] may be used in the formulation of\
    \ Kcb through VI to help incorporating \nthe impact of vegetation density and\
    \ height. Such approach would allow Kcb to be computed for a \nrange of row crops,\
    \ orchards and vines, thus including conditions when soil is not fully covered\
    \ by the \ncrop. For further estimating Kc, a water balance modeling approach\
    \ adopting the dual crop coefficient \napproach [1] is required to estimate soil\
    \ evaporation and thus to estimate the evaporation coefficient Ke \nthat can be\
    \ combined with the VI based Kcb, i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke. The SIMDualKc model [32],\
    \ which \nperforms a daily water balance of the surface soil layer, provides for\
    \ a daily Ke. Thus, by applying the \ndual coefficient approach and performing\
    \ the soil water balance, the SIMDualKc model provides \ninformation on the stress\
    \ coefficient Ks, on potential and actual Kcb, on Ke and ultimately on potential\
    \ \nand actual Kc. \nConsidering the advances and limitations discussed above,\
    \ particularly the need to represent actual \nrather than potential crop and evapotranspiration\
    \ conditions for irrigation management purposes, the \nmain objectives of this\
    \ study are: (i) developing and testing a new equation for estimating actual Kcb\
    \ \nbased on VI and considering the stress coefficient Ks and the density coefficient\
    \ Kd computed with the \nfraction of ground cover fc estimated with VI; (ii) developing\
    \ and testing a combined approach for \nestimation of the actual Kc using the\
    \ VI-based Kcb and the evaporation coefficient Ke obtained with a \ndaily soil\
    \ water balance model; and (iii) testing the adequacy of the approach to different\
    \ crop types, \nnamely maize, barley, and an olive orchard. \n2. Material and\
    \ Methods \n2.1. Study Areas \nThree crops were considered to test the approach\
    \ of actual Kc estimate based on reflectance VI in \ncombination with the SIMDualKc\
    \ soil water balance model: a super high density olive orchard, maize, \nand barley.\
    \ \nThe super high density olive orchard test site is located in Viana do Alentejo,\
    \ in South of Portugal \n(38°24′46′′ N, 7°43′38′′ W, 143 m a.s.l.; Figure 1).\
    \ This olive orchard occupies a total area of 78 ha in \nan undulating terrain.\
    \ The olive orchard was planted in 2006 in a hedgerow system with 1.35 m × 3.75\
    \ m \nspacing (1975 trees ha−1), and an orientation South-North. The olive trees\
    \ are of cultivar Arbequina. \nThe fraction of ground covered by the vegetation\
    \ (fc) was approximately 0.35 and tree height was around \n3.5 m. The procedure\
    \ to obtain fc was based upon the measurements of the projection of crown \ndiameters\
    \ in row direction and perpendicular to it in 51 trees. Soils are sandy loam,\
    \ with soil water \ncontent averaging 0.24 cm3·cm−3 at field capacity and 0.12\
    \ cm3·cm−3 at the wilting point. Ground data \nfrom two consecutive years (2011\
    \ and 2012) were collected and used to validate information of several \nagronomic\
    \ and biophysical parameters as detailed by Paço et al. [8] and Pôças et al. [33].\
    \ In 2012, \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2377 \n \nbetween February 20th and 25th,\
    \ an extremely heavy frost affected the orchard causing a strong leaf \nfall.\
    \ A severe pruning of the trees was therefore applied following the frost occurrence.\
    \ Some areas of \nthe olive orchard were more affected by the frost, and consequently\
    \ the pruning was not uniform along \nthe orchard, which increased the variability\
    \ of the vegetation conditions within the orchard in 2012. \n \nFigure 1. Study\
    \ areas location in Viana do Alentejo and Alpiarça, Portugal. \nThree farmer’s\
    \ fields of Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima located in Alpiarça, Ribatejo region, were\
    \ \nsurveyed for the maize crop [34]: (i) field 1 (39°17′33′′ N, 8°34′19′′ W,\
    \ 14 m a.s.l.); (ii) field 2 (39°17′45′′ \nN, 8°34′01′′ W, 14 m a.s.l.); and (iii)\
    \ field 3 (39°18′04′′ N, 8°32′22′′ W, 16 m a.s.l.), (Figure 1). Fields \nhave\
    \ a cropped area of approximately 30 ha. In 2010, the maize was cropped in both\
    \ fields 1 and 2, \nwhile in 2011 only field 1 was sowed; in 2012, fields 2 and\
    \ 3 were cropped with maize. The PR33Y74 \nmaize hybrid (FAO 600) was cultivated\
    \ with a density of approximately 82,000 plants ha−1. The length \nof each crop\
    \ growth stages for all maize fields and seasons is described in Table 1. The\
    \ crop growth \nstages were defined according to Allen et al. [1]: (i) initial\
    \ stage, from the sowing/planting until 10% \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2378 \n \n\
    of ground cover (Ini); (ii) development stage, from 10% of ground cover until\
    \ maximum ground cover \nby vegetation (Dev); (iii) mid-season stage, from full\
    \ cover until maturity (Mid), and (iv) late-season \nstage, from the beginning\
    \ of senescence and leaves yellowing until harvesting (Late). The observations\
    \ \nof fc were visually performed and adjusted with the help of photographs of\
    \ the ground shadow by the \ncrop near solar noon [34]. \nBarley was sown in field\
    \ 1; two seasons were studied: (i) 2012, a dry year, and (ii) 2012/2013, a wet\
    \ \nyear [35]. The barley field was cropped with 200 kg·ha−1 of malting barley\
    \ (Cv. Publican) seeds using \nan inter-row spacing of 0.15 m. The plants density\
    \ was measured before tillering, when the crop \nattained tree leaves, averaging\
    \ 342 and 319 plants per m2 respectively in 2012 and 2013. The lengths \nof the\
    \ crop growth stages are given in Table 1. The barley fc observations were performed\
    \ similarly to \nthe maize crop; furthermore, LAI measurements were also used\
    \ to estimate fc and therefore to confirm \nrelated observations as referred by\
    \ Pereira et al. [35]. \nTable 1. Crop growth stages of maize and barley crops\

    \ The procedure included image calibration using the \ncoefficients proposed in\
    \ the literature for Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ [37,38]. The VI were \ncalculated\
    \ on a pixel-by-pixel basis and averaged for the entire study plot in each study\
    \ area. Pixels \nfrom the edges of the fields and from roads within the olive\
    \ orchard were not considered. The VI \ncomputed for the study were the Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; [22]) and the Soil \nAdjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (SAVI; [23]). \n2.3. SIMDualKc \nThe SIMDualKc is a soil water balance\
    \ model that applies the dual crop coefficient approach, thus \nseparately computing\
    \ the daily soil evaporation and crop transpiration [32,39]. This model has been\
    \ \nsuccessfully applied to estimate ET and assess Kc of a wide range of field\
    \ crops [34,35,39], including \ntree crops [8,40]. Data from SIMDualKc were used\
    \ as benchmark, i.e., a standard against which \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2380 \n\
    \ \ncomparisons can be done, mainly for the comparison of Kc and Kcb results.\
    \ SIMDualKc was previously \ncalibrated using ground data for the three crops,\
    \ as described later in this section. \nIn SIMDualKc, Kcb is computed with the\
    \ equation below [12,32] where impacts of plant density \nand/or leaf area are\
    \ taken into consideration by a density coefficient: \nܭ௖௕ ൌ ܭ௖ ௠௜௡൅ܭௗ൫ܭ௖௕௙௨௟௟\
    \ െܭ௖௠௜௡൯ \n(1)\nwhere Kd is the crop density coefficient, Kcb full is the estimated\
    \ basal Kcb for peak plant growth \nconditions having nearly full ground cover\
    \ (or LAI > 3), and Kc min is the minimum Kc for bare soil (in \nthe absence of\
    \ vegetation). The Kc min value is about 0.15 under typical agricultural conditions\
    \ and \nranges 0.0–0.15 for native vegetation depending on rainfall frequency.\
    \ Kcb is adjusted by the model for \nlocal climatic conditions where the average\
    \ minimum relative humidity differs from 45% and/or the \naverage wind speed is\
    \ different from 2 m·s−1 [1,12,32]. Kd is computed with the equation proposed\
    \ by \nAllen and Pereira [12]: \nܭௗ ൌ ݉݅݊ ቆ1,ܯ௅݂௖௘௙௙,݂௖௘௙௙\nቀ ଵ\nଵା௛ቁቇ \n(2)\n\
    where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation\
    \ near solar noon [ ], ML \nis a multiplier [ ] on fc eff describing the effect\
    \ of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative \nET per fraction of ground\
    \ shaded (to simulate the physical limits imposed on water flux through the \n\
    plant root, stem and leaf systems), and h is the mean height of the vegetation\
    \ [m]. Therefore, the use of \nKd allows incorporating the impact of vegetation\
    \ density and height in the estimation of Kcb. Kd has \nalso been used in other\
    \ studies to adjust Kcb to actual density conditions for full cover crops [41]\
    \ and in \npartial cover crops using both ground [42] or remote sensing data [43].\
    \ \nWhen soil water deficit occurs, the stress coefficient Ks [ ] is computed\
    \ by the model using a daily \nsoil water balance for the entire root zone. Ks\
    \ is expressed as a linear function of the root zone \ndepletion Dr [1,32]: \n\
    ܭ௦ ൌ \n்஺ௐି ஽ೝ\n்஺ௐିோ஺ௐ ൌ\n்஺ௐି ஽ೝ\nሺଵି௣ሻ்஺ௐ, for Dr > RAW \n(3)\nܭ௦ ൌ 1, for\
    \ Dr ≤ RAW \n(4)\nwhere TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available\
    \ soil water [mm], Dr is the root \nzone depletion [mm], and p is the depletion\
    \ fraction for no stress [ ]. Kcb is multiplied by Ks to account \nfor the effects\
    \ of soil water stress and thus obtaining Kcb act. \nThe calculation of the soil\
    \ evaporation coefficient Ke [ ] follows the procedures proposed by [1,44] \n\
    which include the daily water balance of the evaporation soil surface layer that\
    \ allows to compute the \nevaporation reduction coefficient Kr [ ] from the cumulative\
    \ depth of water depleted (evaporated) from \nthe topsoil [1]. It results that\
    \ Ke is then computed daily with: \nܭ௘ ൌ ܭ௥ሺܭ௖ ௠௔௫ െܭ௖௕ሻ ൑ ݂௘௪ܭ௖௠௔௫ \n(5)\nas\
    \ a function of Kc max, the maximum value of Kc following rain or an irrigation\
    \ event and Kcb in that \nday (Equation (1)) after adjustment with Kr. Ke is limited\
    \ to few Kc max that represents the fraction of Kc \nmax that refers to the fraction\
    \ few of the soil that is both exposed and wetted, i.e., the fraction of soil\
    \ \nsurface from which most evaporation occurs. The background and computation\
    \ of Kcb, Ks and Ke in \nSIMDualKc is described in detail by Rosa et al. [32].\
    \ \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2381 \n \nThe calibration of SIMDualKc aims at optimizing\
    \ the crop parameters Kcb and p relative to the \nvarious crop growth stages,\
    \ as well as the soil evaporation parameters, the deep percolation \nparameters,\
    \ and the runoff curve number (CN) using trial and error procedures until small\
    \ errors were \nachieved. Further information is provided by [8,34,35]. For the\
    \ olive orchard, the calibration was \nperformed comparing daily transpiration\
    \ data simulated with those obtained with sapflow \nmeasurements (and also eddy\
    \ covariance and energy balance measurements as auxiliary data for \ncalibration\
    \ and data quality screening), as described in Paço et al. [8]. For the maize\
    \ and barley crops, \nthe calibration was performed by minimizing the differences\
    \ between observed and simulated soil \nwater content, as described in Paredes\
    \ et al. [34] and Pereira et al. [35]. In all cases, the results of \ngoodness\
    \ of fit indicators showed good model performance and small errors of estimates\
    \ [8,34,35]. \nFurthermore, ET partitioning was performed in other studies, e.g.,\
    \ testing the soil evaporation \nalgorithm through comparing simulated with microlysimeter\
    \ observations [45,46], crop transpiration \nagainst sap flow measurements [8,40]\
    \ and crop ET compared with eddy covariance ET data [47]. An \nexample of the\
    \ results of the model calibration for barley is presented in Figure 2, which\
    \ shows that the \nsimulated soil water content accurately follows the dynamics\
    \ of observations throughout the barley \ncrop season [35]. \n \nFigure 2. Observed\
    \ () and simulated (—–) daily soil water content (SWC) after the \ncalibration\

    \ Vegetation Indices \nThe proposed methodology is based on the dual crop coefficient\
    \ approach, thus integrating daily \nKcb and Ke, and considering Ks when water\
    \ stress occurs [1,12]. Considering this approach, a new \nequation was developed\
    \ to estimate Kcb from the density coefficient Kd and Kc min as proposed by Allen\

    \ and to tree crops with bare soil by including Kd. For tree crops having an \n\
    active ground cover, Kc min is replaced by a Kcb cover, corresponding to the Kcb\
    \ of the ground cover in the \nabsence of tree foliage [12]. Kd in Equation (6)\

    \ considered less sensitive \nto soil background reflectance variability than\
    \ other VI, thus with higher potential for application in \ntree crops with discontinuous\
    \ ground cover. NDVImax was set to 0.75–0.85 for the three crops, and the \nvalue\
    \ 0.10 was set for NDVImin, both based on reference values for, respectively,\
    \ an irrigated \nagricultural field with full cover and a bare soil [48–50]. When\
    \ SAVI was considered, the SAVImin was \nset to 0.09 while the SAVImax was adjusted\
    \ to 0.75 according to Mateos et al. [7]. \nThe Kc min was set to a value between\
    \ 0.10 and 0.15 (0.13 was considered in this study) according to \nvalues proposed\
    \ by Allen and Pereira [12]. For the olive orchard, Kcb cover was considered instead\
    \ of  \nKc min and set to a value between 0.15 and 0.18 (0.17 was considered in\
    \ this study) due to the presence \nof sparse vegetation cover between tree rows.\
    \ Reference values for several parameters considered in \nthe computation of Equation\
    \ (6) can be found in Allen and Pereira [12]. Kd was computed with \nEquation\
    \ (2) where, in a first approach, the fc eff was the same considered in SIMDualKc,\
    \ which was \nbased in field observations (fc field). In a second approach, fc\
    \ eff was computed using an equation based \non vegetation indices derived from\

    \ and 1) depending upon the maximum VI value \nin each crop stage. VIi is the\
    \ average VI of the study area pixels for each date, VImax and VImin \ncorrespond\
    \ to the VI respectively for maximum and minimum vegetation cover. Both NDVI and\
    \ SAVI \nmay be used, with the latter producing better results for incomplete\
    \ cover crops, e.g., olive orchards. \nNDVImax and NDVImin were set according\
    \ to references in the literature [48–50] (Table 4). For the \nsuper high density\
    \ olive orchard, SAVImax and SAVImin were considered following values proposed\
    \ by \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2383 \n \nMateos et al. [7] (Table 4). The parameter\
    \ β2 corresponds to an adjustment coefficient associated with \ncrop senescence\
    \ and leaves yellowing. Both NDVI and SAVI are sensitive to leaf senescence thus\
    \ \nyielding smaller values at the end of the growing cycle than before peak development\
    \ was  \nreached [51]. Therefore, the β2 adjustment is considered to compensate\
    \ the decrease in VI due to the \nsenescence and/or yellowing of plants, which\
    \ is independent from fc. Values of β2 are presented in \nTable 4. \nTable 4.\

    \ sub-stages by dividing the growth stage in two (spring-summer crops; maize)\
    \ or three  \n(winter-spring crops; barley) periods; (2) 0 is considered when\
    \ the crop is in its maximum development and \n0.5 close to the harvest (a value\
    \ of 0.2 was set in the first half of the late stage). \nThe four main stages\
    \ of the crop growth, described by Allen et al. [1], were considered in the \n\
    definition of β1: (i) Ini, (ii) Dev, (iii) Mid, and (iv) Late. Due to the great\
    \ variability of the ground \ncover by the vegetation throughout Dev, a differentiation\
    \ of β1 values according to sub-stages was \nconsidered: (i) two sub-stages in\
    \ spring-summer crops (maize); (ii) three sub-stages in winter-spring \ncrops\
    \ (barley), where the Dev is longer. For the olive orchard, a crop with persistent\
    \ leaves and where \nthe soil cover by the vegetation is incomplete, the β1 value\
    \ was set to 1 throughout the year, except for \nthe period of pruning and in\
    \ the subsequent weeks, when it was slightly decreased to account for the \ndecrease\
    \ in canopies vegetation. Values of β1 are presented in Table 4. \nMost of the\
    \ optical VI track the effects of long-term water stress on plants but do not\
    \ allow the early \ndetection of water stress [52]. Therefore, Equation (6) expresses\
    \ the potential Kcb, thus transpiration \noccurring at maximum rate. However,\
    \ the occurrence of water stress cause a decrease of the potential \nvalue and\
    \ Ks must be applied to obtain actual Kcb VI. In the current approach, Ks computed\
    \ with \nSIMDualKc was used. The dates when water stress was detected through\
    \ the daily soil water balance \nare given in Table 2. Therefore, hereafter, the\
    \ actual Kcb VI refers to the Kcb VI computed by  \nEquation (6) multiplied by\
    \ the Ks computed with SIMDualKc. \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2384 \n \nFor Kc estimation\
    \ from VI, hereafter named Kc VI, the Ke computed with SIMDualKc was combined\
    \ \nwith the Kcb VI, i.e., Kc VI = Ke + Kcb VI. A similar combined approach was\
    \ reported by Mateos et al. [7]. \nThe results of Kcb VI and Kc VI were compared\
    \ with the actual Kcb and Kc computed with SIMDualKc \nbased on field data, later\
    \ referred as Kcb SIMDualKc and Kc SIMDualKc, respectively. \nBecause Ks and Ke\
    \ used in the estimation of actual Kc VI are computed with SIMDualKc, the results\
    \ \nof comparing actual Kc VI with Kc SIMDualKc are somehow influenced by the\
    \ fact that values of Ks and Ke \nused in both cases are the same. Nevertheless,\
    \ this fact does not impede the assessment of the \ncomputation of the actual\
    \ Kcb VI because this is the procedure that gives the possibility to compare the\
    \ \nactual crop coefficients from both approaches and retrieves useful information\
    \ from satellite imagery \naiming at irrigation management and farmer advising.\
    \ \nA linear regression forced through the origin was used for the comparisons\
    \ and the corresponding \nregression and determination coefficients were consequently\
    \ used as indicators. Additionally, the  \nroot-mean-square deviation (RMSD; Equation\
    \ (8)) and the relative mean deviation (RMD; Equation \n(9)) were used to compare\
    \ two sets of data, with Xi relative to estimations with SIMDualKc, having \n\
    mean ܺ ഥ , and Yi relative to the VI estimates (i = 1,2, ..., n). \nܴܯܵܦ ൌ ඨ∑\n\

    Since the database available for this study only comprises 15 VI observations\
    \ for maize and olive \nand seven for barley (Table 2), the validation of Kcb\
    \ estimated based on VI was performed using the  \n“leave-one-out” (LOO) cross-validation\
    \ [53]. Applications of the LOO cross-validation in remote \nsensing studies are\
    \ provided by [54,55]. The LOO cross-validation evaluates the model performance\
    \ \nfor observations not considered in the estimation step, thus providing independent\
    \ estimates of the \npredictive capability of the selected models. This technique\
    \ consists in the removal of one observation \nfrom the dataset used and the estimation\
    \ of a new regression model with the remaining observations. \nThis new regression\
    \ model is used to estimate the Kcb VI of the observation withdrawn (Kcb VI LOO).\
    \ \nEquations (8) and (9) were also used to estimate the goodness of cross-validation\
    \ results, with Xi and \nYi representing respectively Kcb SimDualKc and Kcb VI\
    \ LOO data. A similar approach was considered for the \nKc and fc estimated based\
    \ on VI. \n3. Results \n3.1. Estimation of the Fraction of Ground Cover from VI\
    \ \nThe results of fc estimated from NDVI (fc VI; Equation (7)) were compared\
    \ with fc based on field \nobservations (fc field) for the maize and barley crops\
    \ (Figure 3). The comparison of fc VI and fc field have \nshown a good agreement\
    \ for both crops, with R2 ≥ 0.81 and the regression coefficient b close to 1.0\
    \ \n(Figure 3). For maize, RMSD was 0.10 and RMD 10.6%, while for barley RMSD\
    \ was 0.06 and RMD \nwas 8.1%. \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2385 \n \n \nFigure 3.\
    \ Comparison of the fraction of ground cover by vegetation derived from NDVI \
    \ \n(fc VI) with the fc obtained from field observations (fc field) for (a) maize\
    \ and (b) barley. \nFor the olive crop, due to the low variability of fc field\
    \ values, a regression for comparing fc VI and  \nfc field was not considered.\
    \ The fraction of ground cover for this tree crop with persistent leaves is \n\
    nearly constant throughout the year, except for the pruning period. As such, for\
    \ the analysis of the fc VI \nresults, only the indicators of residual estimation\
    \ deviations were used: RMSD = 0.22 and  \nRMD = 69.2%. When SAVI was used for\
    \ the estimation of fc VI results of all indicators improved \nmuch, with RMSD=\
    \ 0.02 and RMD = 5.5%. The absolute mean differences between the fc VI and the\
    \ fc \nfield for the olive orchard were small, ranging from 0.003 to 0.046. Contrarily,\
    \ for the annual crops \n(maize and barley), the use of SAVI in the estimation\
    \ of fc VI did not improve the residual  \nestimation deviations. \nResults of\
    \ cross validation show a good performance of the fc VI estimation, with RMSD\
    \ of 0.06. \n0.04, and 0.01 respectively for maize, barley and olive. RMD results\
    \ for the cross validation varied \nbetween 2.6% for olive and 7.5% for maize.\
    \ \n3.2. Estimation of Kcb from Reflectance-Based Vegetation Indices (Kcb VI)\
    \ \nThe Kcb VI (Equation (6)) was adjusted using the Ks derived from SIMDualKc\
    \ computations for the \ndates when stress occurred (Table 2) to obtain the actual\
    \ Kcb VI. The values of Kcb SIMDualKc used in \ncomparisons with Kcb VI were also\
    \ adjusted to water stress using Ks. Both NDVI and SAVI were tested \nfor the\
    \ estimation of Kcb VI and the results obtained with the two VI were compared.\
    \  \nThe comparison of actual Kcb VI with actual Kcb SIMDualKc for the studied\
    \ crops is presented in Figure 4. \nThe Kcb VI values in Figure 4 were estimated\
    \ using fc NDVI (Equation (7)) with the objective of fully \nestimating actual\
    \ Kcb from reflectance-based vegetation indices. Figure 4a shows Kcb VI for maize\
    \ when \nusing NDVI, which has a determination coefficient (R2) lower than using\
    \ SAVI (Figure 4b) but has a \nhigher regression coefficient (b = 0.98) relative\
    \ to SAVI (Table 5). Thus, Kcb SAVI underestimates Kcb \nvalues. For barley (Figure\
    \ 4c,d) both b and R2 are better when using NDVI (Table 5). For the olive \norchard\
    \ estimating Kcb VI with SAVI leads to b equal to 1.22 and a R2 equal to 0.83;\
    \ when using NDVI \nthere is an overestimation of the Kcb values, b = 1.8 (Figure\

    \ relative to the comparison between Kcb VI and Kcb SIMDualKc for all crops are\

    \ when adopting SAVI. The regression coefficient b = 0.98 when NDVI \nis used\
    \ indicates a statistical similarity between Kcb VI and Kcb field. For barley,\

    \ of weather conditions in those years are well \napparent through the numerous\

    4.1. Estimation of the Fraction of Ground Cover from Vegetation Indices \nThe\
    \ statistical results relative to the estimation of fc VI indicate a good performance\
    \ of Equation (7) \nfor the annual crops studied (maize and barley). The R2 values\
    \ observed when comparing fc VI with  \nfc field are highly significant for both\
    \ crops (Figure 3). These R2 values are within the range of the values \nreported\
    \ by Trout et al. [56] for the estimation of canopy cover using NDVI derived from\
    \ a \nmultispectral camera for a set of 11 annual and perennial horticultural\
    \ crops. Purevdorj et al. [57] \nreported similar R2 results when estimating the\
    \ percentage of vegetation cover in grasslands and lawn \ngrass using NDVI derived\
    \ from AVHRR satellite images, thus with a coarser spatial resolution. \nEstimated\
    \ deviations are small, for both maize and barley, with RMSD of 0.10 and 0.06,\
    \ respectively. \nThe estimation of fc in the olive orchard also showed good estimation,\
    \ with low RMD < 10%. When \nthe two years studied (2011 and 2012) were analyzed\
    \ separately, the average absolute deviations \nbetween fc VI and fc field were\
    \ slightly higher in 2012 than in 2011. These results are likely due to the \n\
    larger variability in the vegetation conditions within the orchard in 2012 because\
    \ a severe frost \noccurred in February which was followed by an heavy and non-uniform\
    \ pruning that increased the \nvariability of fc within the orchard as discussed\
    \ by Paço et al. [8]. \nThe better performance of SAVI for the estimation of fc\
    \ VI in the high density olive orchard, having \na large fraction of soil exposed,\
    \ is likely due to the lower sensitivity of this VI to soil background  \ninfluence\
    \ [23]. Similar conclusions were reported by Purevdorj et al. [57] relative to\
    \ the better \nperformance of SAVI to estimate the vegetation cover for low crop\
    \ densities. Differently, in a study \nwith savannah-type open woodlands dominated\
    \ by evergreen oak species (montados or dehesa), the \nNDVI performed slightly\
    \ better than SAVI for the estimation of tree canopy cover [58] but the study\
    \ \nareas were characterized by an extremely variable understory including bare\
    \ soil, dry grass and a few \nevergreen shrubs that impacted the VIs values as\
    \ discussed by the authors. \n4.2. Estimation of Actual Kcb from Reflectance-Based\
    \ Vegetation Indices (Kcb VI) \nThe R2 results relative to the regression comparing\
    \ the actual Kcb VI with Kcb SIMDualKc for maize were \nhighly significant using\
    \ NDVI (Table 5). Although using NDVI led to a lower R2 than SAVI, the \nregression\
    \ coefficient comparing Kcb SAVI with Kcb SIMDualKc (b = 0.79; Table 5) indicates\
    \ an \nunderestimation of Kcb SAVI values. The regression coefficient obtained\
    \ when comparing Kcb NDVI with \nKcb SIMDualKc is much better (b = 0.98; Table\
    \ 5), which may be related with the tendency of NDVI \nreaching a maximum value\
    \ at about the same time as Kcb, i.e., at a LAI around 3 [14,59]. Contrarily,\
    \ \nSAVI tends to continue increasing for LAI above 3 [21,25,60]. Thus, according\
    \ to Allen et al. [21], the \nNDVI supports better than SAVI the estimation of\
    \ Kc and Kcb in crops reaching high LAI values as for \nthe full cover crops considered\
    \ in the current study. \nThe base data on maize refers to three different seasons\
    \ and three different fields, which results in a \nlarge variability of soil,\
    \ climate and crop management conditions. A large variability of Kcb act was \n\
    therefore observed despite the potential/standard Kcb was the same after appropriate\
    \ calibration of \nSIMDualKc [34]. This variability contributed for a larger variance\
    \ of the actual Kcb VI and Kcb SIMDualKc \nand made it more difficult to parameterize\
    \ a single value for Kc min and β1 (Equations (6) and (7), \nRemote Sens. 2015,\
    \ 7 \n2392 \n \nrespectively) when considering all three maize seasons and three\
    \ cropped fields. The variability \nconditions observed in the three different\
    \ fields and seasons during the initial and development stages \nmay justify why\
    \ comparing Kcb NDVI with Kcb SIMDualKc leads to a smaller R2 (Table 5). \nThe\
    \ actual Kcb NDVI obtained for the maize mid-season stage averaged 0.92 (Table\
    \ 6). This value \nrelates with the water stress that occurred during the mid-season\
    \ stage of 2010 in both surveyed fields \nwhich was detected in two of the images,\
    \ particularly that of 30 July 2010. The SIMDualKc computed \nKs values for this\
    \ date were 0.55 and 0.29 respectively for field 1 and field 2. Such low Ks values\
    \ \nhighly impacted actual Kcb for this stage. Figure 6a shows well the impact\
    \ of water stress during that \nperiod, with the Kcb act curve largely below the\
    \ Kcb curve. The actual Kcb NDVI are within the range of \nvalues presented by\
    \ Padilla et al. [31]. Relative to the late season, the range of Kcb NDVI values\
    \ in  \nTable 6 refer to three images available for this period. One of these\
    \ images was captured the day prior \nto harvest (19 September 2011 in field 1)\
    \ and the Kcb NDVI was then equal to 0.48, therefore similar to \nthe Kcb end\
    \ proposed by Allen et al. [1], Kcb end = 0.5. However, values for Kcb end relate\
    \ to crop \nmanagement and therefore are difficult to be compared with other values\
    \ in literature. \nFor the regression comparing the actual Kcb VI and Kcb SIMDualKc\
    \ for barley the statistical indicators \nshow that NDVI performed better, both\
    \ in terms of the regression and determination coefficients and \nRMSD and RMD\
    \ (Table 5 and Figure 4c,d). The actual Kcb NDVI obtained for the initial crop\
    \ growth stage \n(actual Kcb ini NDVI = 0.18; Table 6) is just slightly higher\
    \ than the value presented by Allen et al. [1],  \nKcb ini = 0.15, which relates\
    \ with the fact that no water stress occurred in that stage (Figure 6b). Kcb NDVI\
    \ \nvalues for the development growth stage ranged between 0.25 and 0.91 (Table\
    \ 6), which refer to values \ncommonly accepted [1]. The actual Kcb mid NDVI =\
    \ 0.87 (Table 6) is lower than the standard Kcb = 1.10 \nproposed by Allen et\
    \ al. [1] and values obtained for crops with similar canopy [30,31,61]. This is\
    \ likely \ndue to different vegetation conditions in the 2012/2013 crop season\
    \ and to the adjustment to climate [35]. \nThe Kcb NDVI presented in Table 6 for\
    \ the late season ranged between 0.86 and 0.69 and refer to two \nimages available\
    \ for that stage. These images provided for likely appropriate actual Kcb values\
    \ and \ncompared well with values obtained with SIMDualKc (Figure 6b, [35]). \n\
    For the olive orchard, results obtained with SAVI are good (Figure 5) and in agreement\
    \ with the \nabove mentioned lower sensitivity of this VI to changes in soil background\
    \ [23], which is particularly \nrelevant for tree crops with discontinuous ground\
    \ cover. Furthermore, SAVI improves the linearity \nbetween the VI and biophysical\
    \ parameters as observed by other researchers [25,56]. Mateos et al. [7] \nalso\
    \ obtained good results when using SAVI for estimating Kcb in peach and mandarin\
    \ orchards. \nContrarily, in a study with grapevine, Campos et al. [13] did not\
    \ find significant improvements in the \naccuracy when using SAVI but the application\
    \ excluded days with wet soil. Accurate results for olive \nin the current study\
    \ are likely due to the use of Kd in Equation (6). \nThe average Kcb SAVI value\
    \ obtained for the mid-season stage in olive (0.37; Table 6 and Figure 5c) \n\
    was affected by the occurrence of water stress in four out of the eight dates\
    \ considered in this stage, \nwith Ks < 0.77 in two of these dates. The impacts\
    \ of water stress on Kcb is clearly shown in the \nexample presented in Figure\
    \ 6c, with the Kcb act curve laying bellow the Kcb curve during the  \nmid-season.\
    \ The actual Kcb SAVI for this stage would increase to 0.42 when only dates without\
    \ water \nstress or with very mild stress (Ks > 0.95) are considered. The actual\
    \ Kcb SAVI values for olive orchards \nfor the mid- and late-seasons, respectively\
    \ 0.37 and ranging 0.40 to 0.33 (Table 6), are within the range \nof values for\
    \ olive orchards with an effective fraction of ground cover (fc eff) between 0.25\
    \ and 0.5, \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2393 \n \nwith a Kcb mid ranging between 0.35\
    \ and 0.55 and Kcb end ranging from 0.30 to 0.50 [12]. During the \ninitial stage,\
    \ some sparse vegetation was growing in the inter-rows, thus Kcb was only slightly\
    \ \ninfluenced by this sparse vegetation. Consequently, Kcb ini SAVI = 0.33 was\
    \ an appropriate value for  \nthis orchard. \nOverall results obtained have shown\
    \ a good performance of the Kcb VI Equation (6) for all three \ncrops, particularly\
    \ integrating results of fc VI when computing the density coefficient Kd used\
    \ in \nEquation (6). It must be stressed that the use of Kd, which integrates\
    \ the information on fc and crop \nheight, and of Kc min provided good results\
    \ in modeling the actual Kcb VI (Equation (6)) for crops with \nvery different\
    \ canopy structures and ground cover conditions as those used in this study (continuous\
    \ \nversus discontinuous ground cover) for the whole crop season including when\
    \ water stress  \nwas observed. \n4.3. Estimation of Actual Kc by Combining Kcb\
    \ VI with Ke from SIMDualKc (Kc VI) \nThe statistical indicators from comparing\
    \ the actual Kc VI with Kc SIMDualKc show a good performance \nof the model for\
    \ the three crops (Table 7 and Figure 7). The deviations of estimate are very\
    \ low for \nolive and barley and slightly higher for maize. Results are in agreement\
    \ with those discussed for Kcb VI, \nwhich is a component of Kc VI. \nFor the\
    \ maize crop, the actual Kc NDVI values obtained for the development stage ranged\
    \ between \n0.90 and 1.30, which relate with a large variability of Ke values,\
    \ as for the example in Figure 6a. The \naverage Kc NDVI = 0.98 ± 0.11 for the\
    \ mid-season (Table 8) reflects also a large variability as \nexemplified in Figure\
    \ 6a, where one value exceeds 1.20 and the other, due to water stress, is as low\
    \ as \n0.40. When only cases without water stress are considered, Kc VI increases\
    \ to 1.14, a value close to the \nKc reported by Gonzalez-Piqueras et al. [26].\
    \ Regarding the Kc NDVI values for the late-season, values \nobtained are likely\
    \ to occur because they are within the interval limited by the Kc values at mid-season\
    \ \nand those expected for end season. \nThe actual Kc NDVI estimated for the\
    \ initial and development stages for barley (0.78 and 0.75–1.18; \nTable 8) reflects\
    \ the abundance of rainfall during these stages, with various Ke peaks occurring\
    \ then \n(Figure 6b). For the mid-season stage the value obtained is lower than\
    \ the values estimated with \nSIMDualKc (Kc SIMDualKc = 0.99), thus indicating\
    \ an underestimation of Kc. The average value obtained \nfor the late-season stage\
    \ (0.88) is close to that obtained by Liu et al. [62] for the period between wax\
    \ \nripeness and harvesting (equal to 0.83). \nThe results obtained for the olive\
    \ orchard show a very good performance of the model for \nestimating Kc SAVI (Figure\
    \ 7c). The average results of Kc SAVI (Table 8) are within the range of those\
    \ \nproposed by Allen and Pereira [12] for an fc eff between 0.25 and 0.50, which\
    \ vary between 0.80 for the \nKc ini (considering an active ground cover), 0.40–0.60\
    \ for the Kc mid (no active ground cover), and  \n0.35–0.75 for the Kc end (depending\
    \ on the ground cover). The results obtained throughout the year \nfollow a pattern\
    \ similar to results reported by other authors [43,63], as discussed by Paço et\
    \ al. [8]. \nIt is important to highlight that results presented herein correspond\
    \ to actual Kc, thus reflecting the \nmanagement options observed in the study\
    \ areas. \n \n \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2394 \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe overall\
    \ results for the three crops—Maize, barley and olive—indicate that the newly\
    \ proposed \nEquation (7) adequately models the fraction of soil covered by vegetation\
    \ throughout the crop season. \nThe results obtained indicate a better performance\
    \ of SAVI for the computation of the fraction of \nground cover for the incomplete\
    \ cover crop, olive, and of the NDVI for the annual crops, maize  \nand barley.\
    \ \nUsing the novel Equation (6), which applies a density coefficient, the estimation\
    \ of actual basal \ncrop coefficients through reflectance-based vegetation indices\
    \ was successful, with good accuracy. The \nuse of NDVI was preferred for maize\
    \ and barley and SAVI was more accurate for olive. These results \nare consistent\
    \ with the lower sensitivity of SAVI to changes of reflectance in soil background\
    \ due to \nsoil moisture. This approach allowed considering the whole crop season,\
    \ including periods when the \nsoil cover by vegetation is low, as in the initial\
    \ and development growth stages, which was not \nconsidered in several studies\
    \ previously published in the literature. The use of the density coefficient \n\
    allowed considering crops with different canopy structures and incorporating the\
    \ impact of vegetation \ndensity and height. The use of the stress coefficient\
    \ computed with the soil water balance SIMDualKc \nmade it possible to apply the\
    \ methodology not only in days when soil water was adequate to sustain \nfull\
    \ plant transpiration but also in days when heavy water stress conditions occurred,\
    \ contrarily to most \nof the approaches previously published that do not account\
    \ for the crop water stress in  \ntheir formulation. \nThe proposed methodology\
    \ for estimating actual crop coefficients follows a dual crop coefficient \napproach\
    \ by combining a remotely sensed basal crop coefficient and an evaporation coefficient\
    \ \ncomputed with the soil water balance SIMDualKc. Therefore, the approach allows\
    \ integrating the \neffect of plant transpiration with that of soil evaporation.\
    \ \nThe approaches proposed in this study, combining VI data with soil water balance\
    \ data, provide for \nan operational methodology to support irrigation management\
    \ considering the actual cropping \nconditions and associating real time satellite\
    \ information with irrigation scheduling models potentially \napplicable to diverse\
    \ crop types. Nevertheless, further studies are desirable to better test and implement\
    \ \nthe methodology, particularly for other crops and using a larger number of\
    \ image dates. \nAcknowledgments \nThis study was supported by European Union\

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Measurement of plant characteristics is still
    the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and crop management. Rapid and accurate
    acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring
    plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high-throughput
    phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine
    learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high-resolution RGB, multispectral,
    hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR))
    allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question.
    Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful
    tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together,
    these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical,
    and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of
    phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote
    sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries
    in precision agriculture. The research discussed is broadly categorized according
    to strawberry traits related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit
    quality, internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf
    and canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection. Finally,
    we present a synthesis of the potential research opportunities and directions
    that could further promote the use of remote sensing and machine learning in strawberry
    farming. Keywords: artificial intelligence; Fragaria; machine learning; phenomics;
    phenotyping; plant breeding; precision agriculture Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction
    According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Future of Food and
    Agriculture: Alternative Pathways to 2050 report, the global population will reach
    almost 10 billion in 2050 [1], which mandates a continued increase in crop production.
    Meanwhile, agriculture is under increasing resource constraints within the context
    of climate change, with decreasing water and land resources. Precision agriculture
    is an important approach to help meet this goal of a continuous increase in crop
    production. Precision agriculture is an operation and management system supported
    by information technology that makes targeted measurements of plant growth, plant
    health, soil conditions, and other factors [2,3]. Through the integration of the
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Geographic Information System (GIS),
    and remote sensing technologies, precision agriculture can help achieve a number
    of specific goals, such as (1) conduction of farmland surveys; (2) site-specific
    precision application of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation management schemes;
    and (3) fine-scale monitoring of crop status, soil moisture, diseases, and pests
    [2]. Implementing informed and science-based decision-making protocols can increase
    profits and productivity, environmental sustainability, crop quality, and ultimately
    food security [4]. Recently, applications of precision agriculture have gradually
    spread throughout the world as the adoption of auto-guidance systems, yield monitoring
    technology, and variable rate technology (VRT) in agriculture has increased in
    both developed and developing countries over the past 20 years [5]. Another important
    application of precision agriculture is in plant phenotyping, particularly within
    the context of breeding and genetic research. Phenotyping is broadly defined as
    the acquisition and evaluation of complex plant traits, such as geometric structure,
    abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance, yield, and other physiological and
    biochemical characteristics. The measurement of economically important traits
    is essential to plant breeding [6]. With the combination of remote sensing, computer
    vision, and robotics, high-throughput plant phenotyping platforms have been developed.
    These systems usually use multiple sensors to measure various traits, such as
    color, texture, plant height, area, volume, degree of wilting, fresh weight, number
    of flowers/fruits, and quality of fruits [7]. This information enables scientists
    to establish a connection between genotype and phenotype, thus allowing them to
    select resilient varieties with high yield potential in the target environment.
    Of course, the same technologies and similar approaches are also valuable for
    crop management, specifically determination of nutrient needs, water, and pesticide
    requirements, as well as the detection of weeds, pathogens, and pests [8]. At
    present, plant phenotyping is the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and
    crop management. Connecting phenotype to genotype in a set of target environments
    is the basic goal [9]. Next-generation advances in DNA sequencing technology and
    genome assembly methodology have dramatically increased the throughput and lowered
    the cost of genotyping. However, connecting this mountain of genomic information
    to the expression of traits is still a knotty problem [10]. The greatest challenge
    at present is to rapidly acquire large-scale plant phenotyping data with high
    dimensionality, density, and accuracy from single molecules to entire organisms.
    While new phenomics technology has significantly relieved some bottlenecks, many
    questions remain on how to efficiently define and extract complex traits as well
    as improve accuracy and throughput [11]. New advances in remote sensing and machine
    learning have the capacity to solve many of these problems. Strawberry (Fragaria
    × ananassa) is a very popular fruit among consumers by virtue of its appealing
    appearance, flavor, and health benefits [12]. The latest statistics from the FAO
    show that the world’s strawberry yield and cultivated area from 1961 to 2018 grew
    at annual rates of about 1.82% and 2.44%, respectively (Figure 1). A large portion
    of the research conducted during this period focused on the medical benefits of
    strawberries to human health [6]. The high-value market for strawberries has significantly
    promoted the breeding of new varieties worldwide, including in Europe, Asia, and
    North America [13], which is now driving the need for high-throughput phenotyping
    techniques. Accurate and rapid acquisition of heritable traits of interest is
    critical to improving the strawberry breeding selection accuracy. Remote sensing
    and machine learning can greatly relieve the heavy burden of manual work for strawberry
    phenotyping, such as plant height measurement and fruit quality evaluation. How
    to effectively improve accuracy and throughput is a hot research theme. On the
    other hand, strawberry is a highly perishable and labor-intensive crop that can
    benefit greatly from precision agriculture approaches. The fruits have many developmental
    stages and when ripe are very sensitive to environmental and management conditions.
    Plant development and fruit production can continually cycle and change over a
    6-month period, depending on the growing region. Therefore, real-time and intelligent
    monitoring of plant health and development as well as fruit quality assessment
    is essential for crop management and strategy formulation. The combination of
    remote sensing and machine learning is considered to have huge potential and a
    broad application space in these areas. Figure 1. Global trends in strawberry
    yield and harvested area from 1961 to 2018 [14]. In this manuscript, we reviewed
    the use of remote sensing and machine learning in agricultural applications, especially
    focusing on the latest advances in strawberry phenotyping and management. The
    manuscript also presented a synthesis of potential research opportunities and
    directions that could further support strawberry farming. A rigorous two-step
    approach was adopted to search and screen the literature related to remote sensing
    and machine learning applications, with an emphasis on strawberry. Details of
    the adopted approach and the number of articles on each topic are shown in Appendix
    A and Figure A1, respectively. 2. Remote Sensing Platforms and Sensors Remote
    sensing technology has developed rapidly in recent years, with sensors providing
    higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution images. Remotely sensed data
    are acquired by mounting sensors on multiple platforms, including satellites,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), and ground-based vehicles. The unparalleled
    advantage of satellite observation lies in its large area of coverage, which allows
    for collecting various types of datasets, routinely on a global scale. A summary
    of agricultural data sources by Huang et al. [15] presented 28 optical and synthetic
    aperture radar (SAR) satellites for plant vegetation studies, with spatial resolutions
    varying from 0.3 m to 1 km. Research on the agriculture-related applications of
    satellite sensors focuses on several aspects, including crop type classification
    [16], soil property determination [17,18,19], crop mapping and spatial statistics
    [20], crop yield forecasting and canopy parameter estimation [21], and irrigation/drought
    evaluation [19,22]. For example, Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery was used to
    retrieve various biophysical parameters of winter wheat, including the leaf area
    index, leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy chlorophyll content, utilizing vegetation
    indices and radiative transfer modeling [23]. A combination of two indices, enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), derived from optical
    (MODIS) and microwave (Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite, SMAP) remote sensors,
    respectively, was used to make a prediction of the corn, soybean, and wheat yield
    on the county scale, with an accuracy of over 76% [24]. In contrast to satellites,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, can carry low-cost sensors and can
    operate on a flexible on-demand schedule. Due to higher spatial resolution, low
    cost, and high maneuverability, drones have become one of the most widely used
    remote sensing platforms in agriculture. Yang et al. [7] investigated the current
    progress and future prospects of UAVs as a remote sensing platform by reviewing
    96 articles. Radoglou-Grammatikis et al. [25] further made a comprehensive survey
    of UAV applications in precision agriculture. Currently, non-destructive crop
    monitoring and smart spraying are two of the primary UAV applications. Moreover,
    the integration of UAVs, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the Internet of
    Things (IoT) and the maturity of 5th-generation (5G) technology can make several
    applications such as pesticide application, irrigation, crop monitoring, and soil
    property analysis more precise, timely, and efficient [26,27,28,29]. Compared
    with satellites and drones, ground-based platforms enable close-range detection
    of plant characteristics and generally serve as ground truth information sources
    for sensor calibration and data quality control. Ground-based platforms can be
    categorized into sensors mounted on fixed platforms, such as towers or booms (fixed
    scanning systems); handheld field measuring instruments; and sensors mounted on
    mobile ground vehicles [30,31]. Currently, the main sensors used in remote sensing
    agricultural applications consist of passive multispectral, hyperspectral, visible
    RGB (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) sensors, fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging
    sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
    [32]. High-resolution RGB images are widely used in vegetation classification;
    identification of plant leaves, canopy, and fruits; and estimation of geometric
    attributes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging provides spectral information
    about various parameters related to physiological and biochemical attributes,
    such as the leaf area index (LAI), crop water content, leaf/canopy chlorophyll
    content, and nitrogen content [7,33]. These parameters are very useful for crop
    growth evaluation and yield prediction. Fluorescence remote sensing is efficient
    in retrieving the chlorophyll and nitrogen content, nitrogen-to-carbon ratio,
    and LAI [34]. LiDAR has the advantage of a high point-cloud density, which is
    useful for obtaining horizontal and vertical structural characteristics of plants
    [35]. A synthetic aperture radar can function in very low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover). It has been extensively explored in crop classification,
    crop growth monitoring, and soil moisture monitoring [36,37,38]. Specific uses
    of different sensor types in different agricultural applications are elaborated
    by Yang et al. [7]. Strawberry is different from most agronomic crops like corn,
    soybeans, and wheat in various aspects. It is clonally propagated, and a single
    plant is relatively small in size but has a complex growth habit that includes
    several parts such as the crown, leaves, runners, inflorescences, and fleshy fruits.
    Higher-spatial-resolution imagery is needed to reveal the canopy structure and
    identify the fruits. Handheld sensors as well as sensors mounted on UAVs and ground-based
    platforms have been used to study various strawberry phenotyping traits. Some
    commonly used UAV types for agriculture applications are elaborated by Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al. [25]. Ground-based platforms (e.g., tractors) were used to collect high-quality
    images and generate a 3D point cloud for strawberry plants [39]. Handheld non-imaging
    spectrometers that cover a wide spectral range (350–2500 nm) and provide continuous
    spectral reflectance could be used to study strawberry physiological characteristics
    [40]. Additionally, many researchers designed various types of phenotyping platforms
    for strawberry disease detection and fruit quality evaluation. Multispectral or
    hyperspectral sensors mounted on various platforms have been used for specific
    purposes, such as powdery mildew disease detection, fruit grading, and fruit 3D
    construction [41]. Some platforms and topics discussed in this review are shown
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. Strawberry traits can be assessed using a variety of sensors
    mounted on multiple platforms. 3. Machine and Deep Learning Analysis Methods Machine
    learning (ML) is one of the most effective ways to process and analyze the vast
    amounts of data obtained by today’s remote sensing techniques. In general, machine
    learning used in the agricultural field can be grouped into four categories: (1)
    crop monitoring, including yield estimation, disease and weed detection, species
    recognition, and crop quality assessment; (2) livestock management, such as animal
    welfare and livestock production; (3) water regulation, for example, plant evapotranspiration
    estimation; and (4) soil management, including the identification and prediction
    of soil temperature and moisture content [42]. Traditional machine learning methods,
    such as support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and
    random forests (RFs), require the extraction of key features from image or LiDAR
    datasets that sufficiently represent the characteristics of the studied objects
    or phenomena [43,44]. The quality of selected features is critical to the classification
    or prediction performance [45]. However, finding the best feature subset can be
    a time-consuming and subjective process, especially for highly dimensional datasets
    and in problems with a complex domain (e.g., crop yield estimation) [46]. For
    example, Sabanci et al. [47] extracted 12 features of wheat grains from high-resolution
    RGB images, including grain dimension (length, width, perimeter, and area), spectral
    band (red, green, and blue), and texture (contrast, correlation, energy, homogeny,
    and entropy) information. These features were imported into an ANN model to classify
    the wheat into two types, bread and durum, with an accuracy higher than 97%. Deep
    learning (DL) has emerged as perhaps the most important branch of machine learning.
    Deep learning refers to the extension of ANNs to accommodate neural networks with
    a relatively large number of layers that enable hierarchical data representation
    [48,49]. Mainstream deep learning models at present include deep neural networks
    (DNNs) [50,51], recurrent/recursive neural networks (RNNs) for sequence or time
    data processing [52], convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis
    [53,54], deep generative models [55], and auto-encoder networks [56]. In contrast
    to conventional ML algorithms, DL models can achieve optimal discrimination features
    by determining a set of parameters during the training process; thus a specific
    step for feature extraction is not required [49,57]. The main disadvantages of
    DL methods are the need for massive training datasets, computing capacity, and
    training time [58]. Improving existing DL methods and creating novel algorithms
    have been the goals of numerous studies involving agricultural applications. Kamilaris
    et al. [59] reviewed the agricultural problems solved using DL, common DL models
    and frameworks, data sources and corresponding preprocessing procedures, and the
    overall performance of DL by summarizing 40 studies. They identified land cover
    classification, crop type estimation, crop phenology, fruit and weed detection,
    and fruit grading as the current main applications of DL in the agriculture field.
    DL may also have significant potential in seed identification, soil and leaf nitrogen
    content determination, and irrigation management. In addition, they identified
    the potential for long short-term memory (LSTM) or other RNN models in yield prediction,
    disease management, and water needs assessment based on consecutive observations.
    Overall, deep learning has experienced remarkable developmental progress and already
    has a number of operational applications in agriculture. 4. Fruit Traits 4.1.
    Fruit/Flower Detection Automated counting of fruits and flowers from images is
    a critical step in autonomous robotic harvesting and yield prediction [60]. In
    recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, mainly aimed
    at developing new image-based object detection and localization algorithms to
    improve recognition accuracy. Traditional image segmentation methods use morphological
    operations to generate binary images and separate fruits from the background according
    to the similarity of color, spatial texture, and geometric shape. For example,
    Feng et al. [61] introduced a strawberry stem detection and fruit classification
    workflow, which used the OHTA color space to segment the fruit from black-and-white
    plastic sheets, extracted the principal inertia axis feature to define the stem
    position, made a judgment of strawberry ripeness based on the hue intensity and
    saturation (HIS) color space, and then selectively harvested strawberry fruits
    according to fruit ripeness and shape. However, this segmentation method is not
    yet robust and stable enough for application in commercial settings that have
    variable lighting conditions, observation angles, object orientations, relative
    positions, and various clustering and occlusion situations. Recently, CNNs have
    evolved to be the most powerful approach for solving target identification and
    classification problems. The superiority of a CNN in image recognition lies in
    its ability to extract increasingly complex visual concepts and features through
    hierarchical structures. The first few layers can be used to learn simple local
    features, and the deeper hidden layers can capture more complicated semantic information,
    such as shape and texture. Koirala et al. [47] reviewed the use of deep learning
    in fruit detection and yield prediction. The author elaborated on the applications
    of current state-of-the-art DL frameworks in target recognition, including the
    faster regional convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN), single-shot multibox
    detector (SSD), and you only look once (YOLO), and in detectors, including the
    Oxford Visual Geometry Group network (VGGNet), the Residual Network (ResNet),
    and the Zeiler and Fergus network (ZFNet). Fruit weight and yield estimation were
    also discussed, which demonstrates the superiority of deep learning in analyzing
    multi-dimensional remote sensing data. With regard to strawberry flower/fruit
    counting, Lin et al. [62] applied RCNN, Fast RCNN, and Faster RCNN models for
    the identification of strawberry flowers from the image, with an accuracy of 63.4%,
    76.7%, and 86.1%, respectively. The Faster RCNN framework demonstrated good performance
    even if strawberry flowers were occluded by foliage, under shadow, and overlapped
    by other flowers. Another DL framework (SSD) was implemented by Lamb et al. [63]
    for strawberry detection. The authors modified the training images and network
    structure to optimize the detection precision and execution speed. This system
    with a sparse CNN can run quickly on mobile low-power hardware with an average
    precision of 84.2%. Yu et al. [64] further adapted a Mask-RCNN model for mature
    strawberry detection in the RGB image and achieved an accuracy of 95.78% even
    in a non-structural environment, particularly for overlapping and hidden fruits
    and those under varying illumination. Zhou et al. [65] proposed a robust deep
    learning architecture named improved Faster-RCNN, which adopted a transfer training
    technology based on Faster RCNN and greatly reduced the number of strawberry images
    required for training the network. The average fruit extraction accuracy was more
    than 86%. 4.2. Fruit Maturity/Ripeness During strawberry ripening, the fruit surface
    color typically goes through green, white, pink, and red stages, concurrent with
    the accelerated biosynthesis of pigments (e.g., carotenoids and anthocyanins)
    over a period of up to 30 days. Fruit ripening is a complicated process, with
    a variety of internal physical and chemical changes, which is mainly controlled
    by the synthesis and action of hormones [66]. Azodanlou et al. [67] found that
    as the fruit matures, there is an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
    and sugars, as well as a decrease in acidity. Meanwhile, structural changes in
    cell wall polysaccharides, especially the dissolution of pectin, contributes to
    fruit softening. The state of ripeness at harvest directly determines fruit quality
    and shelf life. Unripe fruits have lower nutrient values but are more resistant
    to physical injury. Overripe fruits are more susceptible to the external environment
    and fungal infection [68]. Rahman et al. [69] found that the shelf life of strawberry
    fruits picked at the 1/3rd maturity stage and the full maturity stage were about
    7.8 and 2.4 days, respectively, regardless of the genotype. Therefore, early evaluation
    of fruit ripeness and the determination of optimal harvest time are crucial to
    reducing waste in the supply chain and improving fruit quality [70]. Traditional
    strawberry ripeness assessment is implemented visually and subjectively based
    on the appearance, aroma, color distribution and intensity, as well as texture
    [71,72]. Standard maturity evaluation methods are quantitative, measuring the
    contents of internal quality attributes, such as firmness, soluble solids content
    (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and total anthocyanins [73]. However, this technique
    is destructive, slow and requires expensive specialized devices and expertise
    [74]. Researchers have spent considerable efforts developing simple, non-invasive,
    and high-throughput ways to estimate the ripeness stage of strawberry fruits.
    Most of the studies have focused on extracting spatial and spectral information
    from representative wavelength bands (usually R, G, and NIR bands) to discriminate
    between strawberries at different growth stages. Raut et al. [75] proposed a direct
    color-mapping method to evaluate the redness of strawberries based on RGB images
    and sort them into pre-mature, mature, and over-mature classes. Jiang et al. [76]
    selected the wavelengths 535, 675, and 980 nm and introduced eight spectral indices
    to automatically identify immature, nearly mature, and mature strawberries using
    the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) model, with a prediction accuracy over 95%.
    Guo et al. [77] combined spectral reflectance and textural indicators (correlation,
    contrast, entropy, and homogeneity) of 11 optimal wavelengths from hyperspectral
    images and used the SVM algorithm to classify ripe, mid-ripe, and unripe fruits,
    with an accuracy higher than 85%. Yue et al. [78] assessed strawberry maturity
    in the greenhouse using only a smart phone equipped with 535 and 670 nm optical
    filters, which were chosen to capture anthocyanin and chlorophyll contents, respectively.
    Absorptance data for the two wavelengths served as variables in three regression
    classification methods (multivariate linear, multivariate nonlinear, and SoftMax
    regression). The multivariate nonlinear model yielded an identification accuracy
    of over 94%. Gao et al. [79] further used the AlexNet CNN deep learning model
    to categorize the strawberry fruits into ripe and early-ripe stages using hyperspectral
    datasets, achieving 98.6% classification accuracy. Recently, data collection processes,
    feature extraction and classification algorithms have been integrated into a real-time
    strawberry ripeness evaluation and decision-making system developed for harvesting
    robots [80]. 4.3. Fruit Quality and Postharvest Monitoring Postharvest operations,
    including sorting, grading, and spoilage stage monitoring, are of great significance
    for price determination, fulfillment of orders with specific quality standards,
    and sales strategy formulation [81]. In terms of strawberry grading, manual selection
    is widely based on the shape, size, color, maturity, and imperfection of the fruits
    [82]. Compared with apples and citrus fruits, strawberries are more vulnerable
    to damage due to their high moisture content, lack of exocarp protection, and
    susceptibility to fungal infection [12]. From the moment of harvest, strawberry
    fruits begin to lose nutrition and generally spoil after three days without cold
    storage, potentially generating toxins harmful to human health [83]. Therefore,
    it is helpful to have a rapid and non-invasive inspection method for postharvest
    strawberry monitoring. As with ripeness evaluation, emerging computer vision and
    machine learning technologies have enabled the development of automatic, real-time,
    and non-destructive fruit-grading systems. Liming et al. [84] designed an intelligent
    strawberry-grading system by integrating conveyer belts, cameras, and other auxiliary
    devices and employing multi-attribute decision-making theory to grade the strawberry
    fruit into three or four classes based on color, shape (13 feature parameters),
    and size. The final accuracy was above 90%. Mahendra et al. [85] compared seven
    types of features and used the SVM classifier to categorize the fruits into two
    groups: good and damaged. They found that the speeded-up robust features (SURF)
    were most effective in classification, with an accuracy of 90.73%. Sustika et
    al. [81] evaluated the capability of six CNN architectures (the baseline CNN,
    AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, Xception, and MobileNet) for the binary classification
    (good or bad) of strawberry fruit and its classification into four grading levels
    (1–4 ranking) using RGB images. The study indicated that VGGNet’s performance
    was the best, producing 96.49% and 89.12% accuracy for the binary and the four-grade-level
    classification, respectively. Péneau et al. [86] represented the consumer perception
    of freshness quantitatively by establishing the relationship between the fruit’s
    physiochemical parameters (appearance, odor, texture, and flavor) and consumer/expert
    ratings of freshness. Dong et al. [87] used long-path Fourier-transform infrared
    spectroscopy (FTIR) technology to capture the spectral characteristics of VOCs
    generated after different lengths of storage and then detect changes in VOC (esters,
    alcohols, ethylene, etc.) abundance. A principal component analysis (PCA) was
    implemented on the spectral data to distinguish fresh, slightly spoiled, and spoiled
    strawberries. As for storage time estimation, Weng et al. [12] collected the spectral
    data for strawberries from 0 to 60 h of storage with an interval of 6 h, using
    hyperspectral imaging technology. SVMs and RFs were then used to classify strawberry
    samples from different storage times with an accuracy of 100%. Partial least-squares
    regression (PLSR) [88] analysis has also been used to estimate the storage time
    with a prediction accuracy approaching 100%. 4.4. Internal Fruit Attributes As
    discussed in the previous section, fruit quality is broadly assessed by many parameters
    associated with the external attributes of the fruit, including appearance, texture,
    and flavor. However, the determination of internal fruit attributes (sugar content,
    juiciness, acidity, color, etc.) is also very important. NIR spectroscopy and
    multiple/hyperspectral imaging technology have been effective for evaluating internal
    fruit quality attributes in a non-contact manner. A difference between spectroscopy
    and imaging is that the former can only obtain single-point information, while
    the latter can provide spatial distribution. The VIS/NIR spectral range is usually
    selected for internal fruit attribute studies because it provides information
    about O–H, C–H, and N–H absorptions [89]. Spectroscopy and hyperspectral image
    data are highly redundant and require preprocessing and analysis. Most research
    on the retrieval of internal fruit attributes adopts the following steps: data
    pretreatment (spectral correction and noise reduction), optimal sensitive wavelength
    selection, feature extraction, and prediction model construction. ElMasry et al.
    [90] estimated the moisture content (MC), SSC, and pH of strawberry fruits using
    hyperspectral images. Optimal wavelengths were selected for the MC, SSC, and pH,
    using β-coefficients from partial least-squares models. Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) models were then applied to retrieve fruit quality attributes using the
    spectral data of optimal wavelengths, with prediction accuracies of 87%, 80%,
    and 92% for the MC, TSS, and pH, respectively. Unlike many researchers who only
    used the spectral information directly as input variables, Weng et al. [91] extracted
    the spectral information about optimal wavelengths, 9 color features obtained
    from color histograms and moments, and 36 textural features simultaneously from
    the hyperspectral images for the detection of soluble solid content (SSC), pH,
    and vitamin C. Spectral and color features achieved the best prediction for SSC,
    with an R2 coefficient of 0.94. In terms of pH, optimal prediction was obtained
    using spectral features only, with an R2 of 0.85. A combination of spectral and
    textural features helped improve the estimation of vitamin C, with an R2 of 0.88.
    At present, the main parameters retrieved for the internal fruit quality of strawberry
    include firmness; vitamin C (VC); phenolic compounds; TA; total water-soluble
    sugar (TWSS) content; concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose; SSC; pH;
    MC; and VC. A detailed summary of the acquisition of these parameters using spectroscopy
    and imaging technology is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of articles addressing
    the estimation of internal fruit quality attributes of strawberry based on remote
    sensing and machine learning. 4.5. Fruit Shape Fruit shape is a critical parameter
    affecting the esthetic appearance and marketability of strawberries. Basic shape
    descriptors, such as length, width, and aspect ratio, can be manually measured
    with, for example, a vernier caliper. However, this method is not only labor intensive
    and time consuming but also limited in capturing the complex and multi-dimensional
    aspects of shape and uniformity. Currently, most shape classification studies
    are based on 2D digital images. Ishikawa et al. [103] extracted four types of
    shape descriptors from RGB images taken by a digital camera: (1) measured values,
    including contour line length, fruit length and width, and fruit width/length
    ratio; (2) ellipse similarity (ES) index, including the optimum ellipse area ratio
    and the boundary length ratio, which indicate the ellipse similarity of fruits;
    (3) elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs); and (4) chain code subtraction (CCS).
    Random forest analysis was conducted to categorize strawberry fruit shape into
    nine types: reniform, conical, cordate, ovoid, cylindrical, rhomboid, obloid,
    globose, and wedged. The recall ratio was used for accuracy evaluation since Kappa
    coefficients were not able to classify more than three types. The recall ratio
    ranged from 0.52 to 1, depending on shape type. Oo and Aung [104] proposed a simpler
    but efficient method for strawberry size estimation and shape classification based
    on RGB images. Only three parameters (diameter, length, and apex angle) were imported
    into a three-layer neural network for four classes. The estimation accuracy of
    diameter and length was 94% and 93%, respectively, for strawberries without calyx
    occlusion and 94% and 89% for those with calyx occlusion. The classification was
    between 94% and 97%. Feldmann et al. [105] further extracted 68 strawberry fruit
    shape features of four types (linear and geometric descriptors, outline-based
    descriptors, landmark-based descriptors, and binary-image-pixel-based descriptors)
    from digital images and introduced a method called principal progression of k
    clusters (PPKC), which can automatically discover potential shape classes. Relationships
    between four shape categories and features were built and used for the classification.
    The accuracy varied from 68% to 99%. Zhou et al. [65] used the length-to-width
    ratio of the minimum external rectangle obtained from RGB images to assess the
    plumpness of strawberry fruits. Strawberries were classified into three types
    based on this ratio: plump (0–0.5), approximately plump (0.5–0.8), and fully plump
    (0.8–1). However, this approach applies only for strawberries of globose type.
    Although 2D images can only reflect one dimension or plane characteristics, they
    are sufficient to determine shape properties to some extent. Today, imaging technology
    can obtain three-dimensional information. A 3D-shape-measuring system equipped
    with cameras, a rotation table, and an operation system was designed by He et
    al. [106], which generated 3D point clouds of strawberry fruits using photos from
    various angles and heights using structure from motion (SfM) methods. The errors
    were less than 0.6 mm for 90% and 0.3 mm for 80% or more of the strawberry fruits
    [107]. Construction of 3D strawberry architecture can provide information beyond
    basic descriptors. For example, uniformity is a key shape factor that is directly
    tied to fruit quality and sales volume. Li et al. [108] defined eight uniformity
    variables calculated from the 3D architecture of the strawberry fruit and evaluated
    the importance of each variable for manual uniformity assessment. The results
    showed that circularity of the maximum circumference had the closest predictive
    relationship with the manual uniformity score. A regular shape genetic locus was
    detected and found to be related to three uniformity parameters. 4.6. Strawberry
    Yield Prediction Strawberry harvesting can extend for many months depending on
    the growing system and environment, with dramatic variation in weekly yields.
    Forecasting strawberry yield ahead of time can help growers formulate labor/equipment
    allocation strategies during the harvesting period. Since weather fluctuation
    is a key factor, many studies have been conducted on how weather parameters (e.g.,
    solar radiation, wind, temperature) influence strawberry yield [109]. These significant
    influential factors were combined with other yield-associated traits as input
    for statistical models and machine learning methods to predict strawberry yield.
    For example, Misaghi et al. [110] applied three neural network models (multilayer
    perception (MLP), generalized feedforward neural network (GFNN), and modular neural
    network) for strawberry yield prediction using vegetation indices (normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI))
    and soil characteristic parameters, with up to 94% final accuracy. MacKenzie and
    Chandler [111] built a relational expression between flower counts, temperature
    data, and strawberry total weight, with a coefficient of determination of 0.84.
    Various meteorological parameters (e.g., net radiation, vapor pressure, relative
    humidity) were examined by Pathak et al. [109] for strawberry yield forecast using
    a principal component regression model, achieving 70% yield prediction accuracy.
    Hassan et al. [112] used hyperspectral remote sensing imagery to obtain LAI parameters
    and six vegetation indices (VIs) to explore the relationship between these parameters
    and yield under different growing conditions (organic and conventional). The prediction
    accuracy (R2) was higher than 0.7 except in the treatment using the black plastic
    mulch conventional system (<0.6). The result also showed that six VIs worked better
    than LAI as yield estimators. Maskey et al. [113] utilized predictive principal
    component regression (PPCR), neural network (NN), and random forest (RF) models
    to forecast strawberry yield using 26 parameters related to leaf and canopy properties,
    soil characteristics, and weather conditions. Each of the selected weather parameters
    was highly correlated with strawberry yield, and the neural network (NN) analysis
    provided the best prediction accuracy (95%). Nevertheless, these prediction models
    were generally spatially confined and need to be validated in field experiments.
    Another method for strawberry yield forecasting is to count fruit numbers and
    determine size and maturity using remote sensing images. Deep learning can play
    a crucial role in accomplishing this task. Using the Faster RCNN model, Chen et
    al. [114] predicted strawberry yield by identifying and counting strawberry flowers
    and immature and mature fruits from UAV high-resolution images obtained at two
    heights (2 m and 3 m). The results showed that the mean average precision was
    higher at 2 m (83%) than at 3 m (72%). 5. Leaf and Canopy Traits Leaf and canopy
    traits are generally divided into two types: architectural and biophysical/biochemical
    characteristics. Architectural traits refer to external geometric morphology,
    such as leaf length and width; leaf area; leaf inclination angle; leaf azimuth;
    and canopy height, width, size, and shape. These parameters affect the penetration
    of light through the canopy, light utility efficiency (LUE), and, ultimately,
    photosynthesis efficiency. Biophysical/biochemical parameters describe internal
    physiological characteristics of leaves and are highly associated with crop growth
    dynamics, nutritional status, and photosynthetic capacity. These parameters include
    the green area index (GAI), green fraction (GF), above-ground biomass (AGBM),
    LAI, leaf/canopy water content, leaf/canopy chlorophyll content, leaf/canopy nitrogen
    content, and leaf/canopy temperature, etc. At present, SfM analysis and LiDAR
    are two methods used to generate 3D point-cloud data and obtain 3D structural
    properties of leaves and canopies with desirable accuracy. SfM is a computer vision
    technique that aims to recover the three-dimensional geometry of objects by analyzing
    overlapping images taken from different perspectives [115]. The workflow involves
    several steps: (1) Image feature extraction and matching is performed, where matching
    algorithms are used to detect conjugate features or tie points between overlapped
    images. (2) Camera location and orientation estimation is done using the conjugate
    features in the images. A bundle-block adjustment process is then implemented
    to estimate the position and orientation of each camera at the exposure moment.
    (3) Orthoimage and 3D point-cloud production [116] is then conducted using more
    dense conjugate points detected through image matching. The point cloud can be
    rasterized to produce a digital surface model, which is used to generate ortho-rectified
    image mosaics. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an active remote sensing
    method that utilizes laser to generate 3D point-cloud datasets [35]. Most LiDAR
    systems send laser pulses and compute the distance between the LiDAR source and
    the point where the LiDAR pulse hits an object (e.g., plant leaf) using the laser
    pulse travel time. Other navigation sensors are then used with the measured distance
    to compute the 3D location of the point. Dense 3D points can be created this way
    to accurately depict the surveyed objects. One of the major differences between
    LiDAR- and SfM-based datasets is the significantly higher cost associated with
    LiDAR measurements. LiDAR, however, is capable of producing 3D points along the
    LiDAR laser path, which can reveal some under-canopy information. Both methods
    have been widely used to extract height, size, and shape of various crop plants,
    such as blueberry, maize, and soybean [117,118,119]. Two main approaches have
    been commonly used to retrieve biophysical characteristics and related parameters:
    statistical modeling and radiative transfer modeling (RTM). The former aims to
    establish the relationship between features obtained from remote sensing and field
    measurements using traditional statistical modeling (e.g., regression analysis)
    and machine learning methods. Commonly used image features include spectral (e.g.,
    band values and vegetation indices) and textural information. More than a hundred
    VIs could be calculated using different light spectra combinations extracted from
    UAV hyperspectral imagery, supplying abundant information about vegetation vigor
    and health [120]. It is worth noting that the red edge region, which is defined
    as the wavelength position of the inflection point on the red-NIR reflectance
    slope, has raised wide interest among researchers for LAI and chlorophyll content
    estimation [121]. As an alternative to statistical modeling, RTM considers the
    physical process of interactions between the vegetation canopy and solar radiation.
    Through the simulation of canopy reflectance, canopy parameters can be retrieved
    by RTM as long as other input parameters (radiation intensity, observation angle,
    soil conditions, etc.) are known [122,123]. Kattenborn et al. [124] revealed how
    canopy reflectance is linked with functional traits using the PROSAIL radiative
    transfer model (combination of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL
    canopy bidirectional reflectance model). Recently, several scholars have compared
    and combined these two approaches to implement leaf/canopy property retrieval
    [81,124,125]. Studies on phenotyping of strawberry leaves and canopies using remote
    sensing techniques are relatively rare. Luisa et al. [126] investigated the relationship
    between 11 spectral response indices and nitrogen (N) content of young, mature,
    and old leaves. The results showed that only green reflectance (550 nm) was responsive
    to N fertilization for individual leaves. At the canopy level, green reflectance
    (550 nm), red reflectance (680 nm), VI, and NDVI were highly correlated with N
    content, with an R2 of 0.5, 0.6, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively. Sandino et al.
    [127] adopted a basic computer vision method to estimate strawberry leaf coverage
    from RGB images with an accuracy of 90%. Procedures such as smoothing, dilatation,
    contour detection, threshold segmentation, and edge detection operations were
    used. Similarly, a more complex algorithm was introduced by Jianlun et al. [128]
    to segment the greenhouse strawberry leaf edge from the background noise in the
    images, which integrated the scale space wavelet transformation, canny edge detection,
    Otsu threshold segmentation, and morphological analysis approaches. Guan et al.
    [129] extracted planimetric canopy area, canopy surface area, canopy average height,
    standard deviation of canopy height, canopy volume, and canopy smoothness parameters
    from high-spatial-resolution RGB images (~0.5 mm) through SfM, object-based image
    analysis (OBIA), and GIS analysis. Three of the variables were used to predict
    the leaf area (R2 = 0.79) and dry biomass (R2 = 0.84) throughout the strawberry-growing
    season using multiple linear regression analysis. Abd-Elrahman et al. [130] built
    on this study by developing automated canopy delineation and canopy size metric
    extraction models to predict strawberry biomass at greater throughput. Takahashi
    et al. [131] applied Kinect (the depth sensor used in the Microsoft XBOX console)
    to detect plant height and leaf area receiving direct sunlight at different leaf
    layers over time under different environments. These parameters were compared
    to the yield, dry weight, and nitrogen content inside the leaf. Kokin et al. [132]
    used a thermal camera to examine the difference between the strawberry leaf surface
    temperature and ambient air temperature under night frost conditions, which reached
    a maximum of ~8 °C. 6. Abiotic/Biotic Stress Detection 6.1. Water Stress Water
    deficit stress refers to the inhibition effect on plant growth caused by soil
    water deficiency or high evaporation requirement in a low-humidity atmosphere.
    The detection of the plant response to water stress is critical to irrigation
    management. Current irrigation practices are generally based on indirect estimation
    of plant water demand or evaporation calculated from soil moisture content and
    meteorological data [133,134]. Gutiérrez et al. [135] developed an automated irrigation
    system equipped with a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and temperature
    sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Through irrigation control based
    on soil moisture and temperature threshold values, 90% saving was achieved in
    water consumption compared to traditional irrigation practices. Morillo et al.
    [136] implemented precision drip irrigation for strawberries using crop water
    requirement estimates and optimum irrigation pulse design. The method incorporated
    soil water content and crop evapotranspiration data obtained from a local meteorological
    station. In contrast, monitoring physiological changes in plants due to water
    stress provides a more direct and intuitive way to assess water demand. Under
    water stress, a plant’s temperature increases due to stomatal closure and reduced
    transpiration. Severe water scarcity can lead to wilting and loss of key pigments
    such as chlorophyll, which cause irreversible damage to the photosynthesis process.
    Multiple remote sensors have been used to detect pre-symptom changes. Commonly
    used sensors for this approach include the thermal imager (TIR; 8–14 µm), VIS,
    NIR, shortwave infrared reflectance (400–2500 nm), and sun-induced fluorescence
    (SIF; 685 and 740 nm). Thermal infrared imaging has demonstrated advantages compared
    to other remote sensing spectral domains in crop water stress detection. Through
    the analysis of information in different spectral ranges, numerous indices sensitive
    to water stress were proposed, such as temperature-based indices (stress degree
    day (SDD), crop water stress index (CWSI), and water deficit index (WDI)) and
    leaf-water-content-related indices (water index (WI), leaf water index (LWI),
    moisture stress index (MSI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI)) [137].
    These indicators can quantitatively reflect the water deficit of leaves or canopy
    to some extent. As for strawberries, drought severely limits plant growth and
    reduces yield and fruit quality. Extensive research has been done to investigate
    responses of strawberries to water stress, including changes in yield and morphological,
    physiological, and biochemical properties. Drought-tolerant cultivars have been
    selected according to their adaptability to limited water supply [138]. Numerous
    parameters related to strawberry growth status, such as leaf area, leaf size,
    leaf longevity, dry mass, number of leaves per plant, leaf expansion rates, leaf
    chlorophyll content, chlorophyll stability index, leaf moisture content, stomatal
    conductance, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, root development, and plant
    height, exhibit a decreasing tendency under water stress [139,140,141]. Adak et
    al. [142] found that water deficit increased some biochemical features of fruits,
    such as total phenolics, total anthocyanins, antioxidant activity, and sugar content.
    Strawberry fruit weight and yield per unit declined by 59.72% and 63.62%, respectively,
    under water stress as compared to control conditions. It is helpful in crop management
    to provide a real-time, accurate assessment of water demand inside the strawberry
    plant. Peñuelas et al. [143] found that strawberry leaf temperature and the CWSI
    obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer were very useful in evaluating even
    mild water stress. Razavi et al. [144] used chlorophyll fluorescence to identify
    drought stress in strawberries. Delalieux et al. [145] compared plant height,
    NDVI, red edge inflection point (REIP), and pigment-specific simple ratio for
    chlorophyll b (PSSRb) differences between strawberries under two irrigation scenarios
    (20% and 100%) using the COmpact hyperSpectral Imaging (COSI) system. The study
    indicated that the growth inhibition caused by water shortage could be detected
    using these spectral characteristics. Li et al. [146] measured strawberry plant
    temperature, dry surface temperature (Tdry), wet surface temperature (Twet) for
    a single point, and the whole plant area using a TIR sensor. They found the CWSI
    to be significant in detecting strawberry water stress. More indicators were examined
    by Gerhards et al. [147], including surface temperature (TS), CWSI, sun-induced
    fluorescence (F687, F780), and TIR indices, as well as the visible and near infrared
    (VNIR)/short-wave infrared (SWIR), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), and moisture stress index (MSI). These results
    illustrate the great potential of remote sensing in water stress detection. 6.2.
    Pest and Disease Detection Strawberries are susceptible to many insects, mites,
    pests, and microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that regularly cause
    reductions in total and marketable yield [148,149]. Early diagnosis and control
    of strawberry pests and diseases is critical to avoiding yield losses. The occurrence
    of plant diseases is a process of pathological and physiological changes. Internal
    symptoms of diseased crops are eventually reflected as abnormal changes in external
    morphological characters, such as necrosis, rot, and deformity of strawberry roots,
    stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Visual identification of pathogen signs and
    plant disease symptoms performed by trained experts is the common practice. Nevertheless,
    this process is post-symptom, and its accuracy depends on the individual’s experience.
    Microscopic methods are not feasible for large-scale commercial detection of pest
    and disease problems [150]. Numerous studies have utilized remote sensing to recognize
    various strawberry diseases, such as powdery mildew, anthracnose crown rot, verticillium
    wilt, and gray mold (Figure 3). Reflectance at various spectral bands contains
    significant information about plant biophysical and biochemical properties, such
    as leaf pigment content (VIS: 400–700 nm), leaf internal structure and water content
    (NIR: 700–1100 nm), and the composition of leaf chemicals and water content (SWIR:
    1100–2500 nm) [139]. Consequently, remote-sensing-based plant disease detection
    methods focus on the optical characteristics of infected and healthy strawberry
    plants in the images acquired by one or more sensors. The majority of the current
    research in this area focuses on differentiating between healthy strawberries
    and those affected by a single disease. Machine learning (particularly deep learning)
    plays an important role in analyzing images for disease detection. For example,
    Park et al. [151] applied a CNN to classify healthy and diseased strawberry using
    RGB images taken by a smart phone, with 89.7% accuracy. Chang et al. [149] extracted
    40 textural indices from high-resolution RGB images and compared the performance
    of three supervised learning classifiers, ANNs, SVMs, and K-nearest neighbors
    (KNNs), in detecting the strawberry powdery mildew disease. The overall classification
    accuracy was 93.8% and 78.80% for the ANN and KNN classifiers, respectively. More
    studies addressing strawberry disease detection are detailed in Table 2. Figure

    Table 2. Summary of recent articles investigating strawberry diseases using remote
    sensing and machine learning. 7. Discussion and Outlook The primary aim of this
    manuscript was to present an overview of how remote sensing and machine learning
    have been used in strawberry phenotyping and management. We reviewed studies that
    have applied state-of-art technological breakthroughs in machine and deep learning
    techniques to detect strawberry fruits and flowers from images with high accuracy.
    This work contributed greatly to autonomous robotic harvesting and yield prediction
    applications. Statistical models and machine learning methods were explored to
    evaluate strawberry fruit ripeness, estimate internal fruit attribute parameters,
    and monitor postharvest fruit quality based on RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral
    image datasets. Various image-based fruit shape descriptors were suggested, such
    as fruit contour line length, uniformity, and ellipse similarity indexes. Structures
    from motion algorithms were used to generate 3D point clouds of strawberry fruits.
    Canopy and leaf images were analyzed to build models relating the biochemical
    content of leaves and spectral indexes as well as predict biophysical parameters,
    such as dry biomass and leaf area. Additionally, studies related to the detection
    of abiotic and biotic stressors were developed. Table A1 lists a categorized summary
    of the studies reviewed in this manuscript that were not presented in tabular
    form. Although remote sensing data acquisition and machine learning data analysis
    are already advancing the prospects of strawberry precision agriculture and phenomics
    applications, there is still an urgent need for further exploration. For example,
    questions related to how to expand the robustness and transferability of the statistical
    and machine learning models connecting fruit quality to image-based spectral and
    geometrical information are still active research topics. Deep learning is also
    very promising for further advances in fruit quality assessment. A deep learning
    method may enable obtaining multiple fruit quality parameters, such as shape,
    size, color, and internal attributes, simultaneously, which can help build a comprehensive
    evaluation system for strawberries and promote the automation of postharvest grading
    processes. Strawberry yield forecasting can be improved by integrating multiple
    variables such as weather condition, soil parameters, fruit/flower counts, canopy
    metrics, and various spectral indices from hyperspectral images as input. Many
    of these parameters, such as fruit and flower count and canopy size, can be extracted
    directly from the images using deep learning networks, which may effectively increase
    prediction accuracy and reduce manual work of feature extraction. Continuous,
    real-time observations of leaf and canopy phenotyping traits are critical to monitoring
    the growth and nutritional status of the plants. With the advancement of remote
    sensing technology, UAVs and updated ground-based platforms are being used extensively
    in agriculture. Sensors that are expensive and hard to access, like LiDAR and
    hyperspectral cameras, are gradually becoming more affordable. Thus, an increasing
    number of studies are being conducted on using remote sensing and machine learning
    to obtain structural (e.g., leaf width/length, leaf inclination angle, and canopy
    height and width), biophysical (e.g., LAI and biomass), and biochemical (e.g.,
    chlorophyll and nitrogen content) traits of agronomic crops, fruit trees, and
    vegetables. Strawberry fruit shape is mostly depicted and evaluated by features
    extracted from 2D and 3D information facilitated by SfM and LiDAR technologies.
    As those technologies become more ubiquitous, more fruit descriptors and novel
    assessment systems can be developed based on the 3D architecture of strawberries.
    Although SfM methods were applied to high-spatial-resolution RGB images [129,130]
    to calculate several strawberry canopy parameters (e.g., canopy area, average
    height, volume, and smoothness), LiDAR could be used to obtain detailed information
    about a strawberry plant’s structural properties. For example, Jiang et al. [166]
    analyzed LiDAR data and proposed various quantification factors for the bush architecture
    of blueberries, including bush morphology (height, width, and volume), crown size,
    and shape descriptors (path curve λ and five shape indices). This type of research
    can be readily transferred to the strawberry domain. Besides, there is a great
    deal of progress to be made in predicting strawberry biophysical parameters and
    the photosynthesis process, and there is much to learn from other crops. Paul
    et al. [167] applied Gaussian process regression and the SVM model to estimate
    the canopy-averaged chlorophyll content of pear trees based on convolutional auto-encoder
    features of hyperspectral data. Li et al. [168] summarized the development of
    remote sensing imaging technologies for retrieval and analysis of information
    about various nutrition parameters, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
    iron, and magnesium. The study showed that a leaf or canopy nutritional distribution
    map can be generated, and the coefficient of determination (R2) of nitrogen even
    reached 0.91. Lu et al. [169] found that the total emitted solar-induced chlorophyll
    fluorescence (SIF) is more effective than top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF in the prediction
    of forest photosynthesis. Dechant et al. [170] further revealed the canopy structure
    is dominant in the relationship between SIF and gross primary production (GPP)
    for rice, wheat, and corn. Studies like these in strawberry are few. Multispectral
    and hyperspectral datasets, radiative transfer modeling, and machine learning
    analysis may be comprehensively applied to study strawberry’s biophysical properties
    and photosynthesis processes. Furthermore, in a general sense, there is still
    room for model and algorithm development and the fusion and application of multiple
    types of remote sensing images. At present, several studies have assessed the
    feasibility of different methods or parameters in the detection of biotic and
    abiotic strawberry stresses, focusing on single stressors at discrete time points.
    These works have tried to distinguish between healthy plants and those with a
    single disease, improving discrimination accuracies where possible, as shown in
    Table 2. For future high-throughput disease detection, there is a need to integrate
    multiple sensors and multiple time points to identify field areas and plants under
    stress automatically and rapidly, diagnose the stressor type and evaluate its
    severity, comprehensively assess plant health through time, and model and predict
    plant responses to management strategies. 8. Conclusions Strawberry is different
    from most agronomic crops like corn, soybean, and wheat in various aspects. It
    is generally grown on raised-bed structures instead of flat ground and is also
    grown in hydroponic systems and under greenhouse and plastic tunnel structures.
    Strawberry is clonally propagated and has a complex growth habit that includes
    several plant parts, such as the crown, leaves, runners, inflorescences, and fleshy
    fruits. The fruits have many developmental stages and when ripe are very sensitive
    to environmental and management conditions. Plant development and fruit production
    can continually cycle and change over a six-month period, depending on the growing
    region. These characteristics make phenotyping considerations complex for strawberry.
    Therefore, the methods developed in major row crops must be creatively adapted
    to strawberry. The development of ground-based devices, UAVs, and emerging field
    robotics is advancing the potential for monitoring strawberry growth throughout
    the entire growing cycle, from planting to final harvest. Remote sensing can provide
    massive amounts of data about crop condition and health via plant and fruit characteristics.
    This deepens our knowledge about the crop itself and allows more advanced management
    practices. Remote sensing may also be useful for postharvest evaluation of strawberry
    fruits. Spectral and textual information obtained from multiple sensors can capture
    both external and internal fruit traits. Further, available artificial intelligence
    options include an expanding array of deep learning techniques and computer vision
    analysis methods. This combination of advances in sensors and data extraction
    and analysis will continue to accelerate the use of precision agriculture in strawberry
    production and phenomics technology in strawberry breeding and genetics. Author

    Appendix A A two-step approach was adopted to search and screen the literature
    related to remote sensing and machine learning applications, with an emphasis
    on strawberry. In the first step, refereed articles about remote sensing, machine
    learning, phenotyping, and strawberries were collected from the IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect,
    Web of Science, and Google Scholar scientific database portals. The following
    query was used, which included the keywords implemented in the search: [“machine
    learning” OR “deep learning” OR “computer vision” OR “remote sensing” OR “phenotyping”
    OR “phenomics”] AND [“strawberry”]. In the second step, we screened a total of
    79 papers resulting from the search, of which 60 dealt with strawberry phenotyping
    and 19 were related to strawberry management during growth and development. The
    number of articles on each topic is shown in Figure A1. Figure A1. Number of articles

    \ achieve sustainable development and to ensure water availability in \nhydrological\
    \ basins, water managers need tools to determine the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ \n(ET) on a large scale. Field energy balances from irrigated and natural ecosystems\
    \ together \nwith a net of agro-meteorological stations were used to develop two\
    \ models for ET \nquantification at basin scale, based on the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation. The first model \n(PM1) uses the resistances to the latent heat fluxes\
    \ estimated from satellite measurements, \nwhile the second one (PM2) is based\
    \ on the ratio of ET to the reference evapotranspiration \n(ET0) and its relation\
    \ to remote sensing parameters. The models were applied in the  \nLow-Middle São\
    \ Francisco river basin in Brazil and, after comparison against field results,\
    \ \nshowed good agreements with PM1 and PM2 explaining, respectively, 79% and\
    \ 89% of \nthe variances and mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.44 and 0.34 mm d−1.\
    \ Even though the \nPM1 model was not chosen for ET calculations, the equation\
    \ for surface resistance (rs) was \napplied to infer the soil moisture conditions\
    \ in a simplified vegetation classification. The \nmaximum values of rs were for\
    \ natural vegetation—caatinga (average of 1,937 s m−1). \nWine grape and mango\
    \ orchard presented similar values around 130 s m−1, while table \ngrape presented\
    \ the lowest ones, averaging 74 s m−1. Petrolina and Juazeiro, in \nPernambuco\
    \ (PE) and Bahia (BA) states, respectively, were highlighted with the biggest\
    \ \nirrigated areas. The highest increments are for vineyards and mango orchards.\
    \ For the first \ncrop the maximum increment was verified between 2003 and 2004\
    \ in Petrolina-PE, when \nthe cultivated area increased 151%. In the case of mango\
    \ orchards the most significant \nperiod was from 2005 to 2006 in Juazeiro-BA\
    \ (129%). As the best performance was for \nPM2, it was selected and used to analyse\
    \ the regional ET at daily and annual scales, \nmaking use of Landsat images and\
    \ a geographic information system for different soil \nOPEN ACCESS\nRemote Sens.\

    \ conditions. Considering the daily rates of the regional ET, pixels with values\
    \ \nlower than 1.0 mm d−1 occurred outside the rainy season, representing the\
    \ caatinga species. \nValues from 1.0 to 5.0 mm d−1 during the driest conditions\
    \ of the year coincided with \nirrigated crops, being the highest values for table\
    \ grapes. The highest accumulated ET \nvalues during 2006 were for mango orchards,\
    \ being around 500–1,300 mm yr−1. Vineyards \npresented lower values, ranging\
    \ from 450–800 mm yr−1, while in caatinga they were \nbetween 200 and 400 mm yr−1.\
    \ It could be concluded that irrigated mango orchards and \nvineyards in that\
    \ year consumed more water than caatinga by factors of 3 and 2, \nrespectively.\
    \ The mango orchards and vineyard areas, representing 19.4 and 8.2% of the \n\
    total irrigated area, respectively, resulting in a total evaporative depletion\
    \ of 0.22 km3 yr−1 \nin the growing regions comprised of the agro-meteorological\
    \ stations.  \nKeywords: energy balance; modeling; latent heat flux; water management;\
    \ satellite \nmeasurements \n \n1. Introduction  \nDisputes over shared water\
    \ resources are raising local, national, and even international tensions. \nRising\
    \ conflicts are expected as populations expand, economies grow, and the competition\
    \ for limited \nwater supplies intensifies [1]. Basin-level dialogs among different\
    \ users to negotiate and agree on the \nallocation of water resources are required.\
    \ The success of any dialog depends on the knowledge base and \nthe general trust\
    \ in data sources, such as the actual evapotranspiration (ET) of each land use\
    \ type. \nExperimentally, the calculation of ET can be made accurately using the\
    \ Bowen ratio (BR) method, eddy \ncovariance (EC) techniques, and scintillometers.\
    \ The BR method has been applied in agricultural crops \nand natural vegetation\
    \ [2-5]. Examples of EC measurements can also be found [6-14]. However, the \n\
    spatial variability is significant and extrapolation of energy balance data directly\
    \ from flux tower to a \nsurrounding landscape environment can lead to inaccurate\
    \ regional estimates. Aiming to increase the \nspatial scales, ET was obtained\
    \ by means of scintillometers across a path length of several  \nkilometers [15,16],\
    \ but these field methods cannot provide a fair sample of a whole biome [17].\
    \ \nRemote sensing, excluding the need of quantifying other complex hydrological\
    \ processes, is an \nexcellent means for determining and mapping the spatial and\
    \ temporal structure of the energy balance \ncomponents, including ET, at basin\
    \ scale.  \nVegetative indexes remotely obtained, together with agro-meteorological\
    \ data, can be used to \nextrapolate ET values from local to regional scales.\
    \ Hydrological models are in general too complex and \ncostly for this extrapolation\
    \ because of the difficulty in obtaining data sets in different hydrological \n\
    uniform sub-areas and due to this deficiency, these models can yield unreliable\
    \ results [18]. \nOversimplification of land surface complexity may cause hydrological\
    \ models to be biased and if \nspecies-specific algorithms were needed to scale\
    \ tower data to larger areas, detailed, species-level \nvegetation maps of each\
    \ river stretch would be necessary [19]. With the technological advances in \n\
    satellites, electronic equipment and informatics in the 21st century, several\
    \ remote sensing methods for \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n          \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n         \n \n \n1289\nregional ET calculations have been reviewed and\
    \ improved [20-28]. Research on obtaining crop \ncoefficients for applications\
    \ in water management have also been carried out [29-37].  \nSeveral remote sensing\
    \ algorithms have been developed. The energy balance methods have several \nadvantages.\
    \ The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land—SEBAL [38], the Surface Energy\
    \ \nBalance Index—S-SEBI [39] and the Surface Energy Balance System—SEBS [40],\
    \ taking into account \nthe crop conditions can be applied to various ecosystems\
    \ without the need of crop classification. The \nidentification of fruit trees\
    \ from satellite data is not straightforward [41]. Unresolved problems for \n\
    identifying different fruit crops in the semi-arid region of the São Francisco\
    \ river basin in Brazil were \nreported [42]. It is considered easier to determine\
    \ ET based on thermal infrared imagery, rather than \nthrough the procedures of\
    \ crop classification [43]. However, the disadvantage of the energy balance \n\
    methods is the need to identify extreme conditions, which is not required for\
    \ the Two-Source  \nModel—TSM [44], Dual-Temperature Difference—DTD [45] and Disaggregated\
    \ Atmosphere Land \nExchange Inverse model—DisALEXI [46]. The aerodynamic resistance-surface\
    \ energy balance \napproach—RSEB [47] failed because small errors in the radiative\
    \ temperature translate into large errors \nin the sensible heat fluxes, and then\
    \ into estimates of ET.  \nOne of the problems in relation to the applicability\
    \ of the energy balance models, aimed at the end \nusers, is the need of background\
    \ knowledge in radiation physics involved inside these algorithms. The \nsuitability\
    \ of applying the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation by the surface conductance algorithm\
    \ has \nbeen shown by using remotely-sensed vegetation indices (leaf area index\
    \ and NDVI) together with \nweather data [23]. The big advantages of the PM equation\
    \ are the applicability and the low sensitivity \nto input data and parameters.\
    \ Its use is also highlighted by the METRIC model, which applies the \nreference\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0) throughout the ratio ET/ET0 to extrapolate instantaneous\
    \ values of \nET to larger time scales [48].  \nET remote sensing methods have\
    \ been useful for studies that were carried out involving net \ndepletion of river\
    \ flows, administering water rights, crop water requirements and irrigation \n\
    management in the Western US states [49]. The effectiveness of using very high\
    \ resolution visible and \nthermal infrared images in an Israeli vineyard for\
    \ scheduling irrigation was demonstrated [50]. \nThermal infrared measurements\
    \ have enabled growers to produce maps of relative water stress in \norchards\
    \ [51]. With the use of ET and biomass production maps, crop water productivity\
    \ was analyzed \nin the semi-arid conditions of Brazil [37]. However, the remote\
    \ surface temperature and vegetation \ncover must be at high enough resolutions,\
    \ where different land surface conditions can be distinguished, \nimportant for\
    \ the validation of ET estimated by land surface models [52]. Procedures for the\
    \ validation \nof remote sensing models have been carried out [53-60]. The research\
    \ primarily involved comparing \nenergy balance measurements from satellites with\
    \ those of tower-based systems. Data from flux \nstations increase the confidence\
    \ in remote sensing techniques, however, the success of the applicability \nof\
    \ satellite images in quantifying water consumption is conditioned by the availability\
    \ of biophysically \nrealistic models, which are simple enough for implementation\
    \ [23].  \nThe intensification of agriculture in the Low-Middle São Francisco\
    \ river basin, Brazil, with mainly \nfruit crops, has caused large land use changes,\
    \ with the replacement of the natural vegetation (caatinga) \nby large irrigated\
    \ areas. Water scarcity in some areas and periods of the year has been a problem\
    \ and \nthe drainage of irrigated agriculture may affect the water quality. With\
    \ the reduction of the amount of \ngood quality water, conflicts among users tend\
    \ to rise. To avoid both water scarcity and water excess, \nRemote Sens. 2010,\
    \ 2  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n1290\none must have efficient\
    \ tools to quantify ET at the basin scale. Field energy balance measurements in\
    \ \nthis region have been done in vineyards [5], mango orchard [13] and natural\
    \ vegetation [14]; however, \nthe results from these specific flux towers are\
    \ only first estimations of ET in a region containing \ndifferent ecosystems.\
    \  \nThe energy balance methods using satellite measurements have the advantage\
    \ that, while taking into \naccount the crop growing conditions, they do not require\
    \ a crop classification. However, for some of \nthem, identification of extreme\
    \ conditions is necessary [38-40] which can be difficult during the rainy \nseasons.\
    \ The SEBAL algorithm was calibrated and validated with field measurements in\
    \ surfaces with \nhydrological contrast in the semi-arid region of the São Francisco\
    \ river basin [27]. Although the model \nperformed well, the difficulty lies in\
    \ its assumption of zero ET for dry pixels, which is difficult during \nthe rainy\
    \ season, because the regional moisture status is homogeneous in the mixed ecosystems\
    \ of \nirrigated crops and natural vegetation.  \nConsidering the simplicity of\
    \ application, and its needing neither crop classification nor extreme \nconditions,\
    \ two models based on the PM equation were developed and validated with field\
    \ data from \nfour flux stations involving irrigated crops and natural vegetation,\
    \ in the semi-arid conditions of the \nLow-Middle São Francisco river basin [5,13,14].\
    \ The modeling involved the net radiation and soil heat \nfluxes, the resistances\
    \ to water fluxes, and interpolated weather data. Remote sensing parameters from\
    \ \nLandsat images, together with field energy balance experiments and a net of\
    \ agro-meteorological \nstations were used. The two simple observation models,\
    \ when used with satellites and a net of  \nagro-meteorological stations, will\
    \ be appropriate for implementation at basin scale for ET monitoring. \nAfter\
    \ validation, a first application of the one selected was done for regional and\
    \ incremental ET \nanalyses at daily and annual scales, which are useful for decision-making\
    \ policies in conditions of \nquick land and water use changes.  \n2. Material\
    \ and Methods \n2.1. Modeling Evapotranspiration \n2.1.1. General Equations \n\
    The physical process, whereby water flows from evaporating surfaces into the atmosphere,\
    \ is \nreferred to as actual evapotranspiration (ET). This water flux occurs via\
    \ canopies through stomata as \nactual transpiration and directly from the soil\
    \ surface as actual evaporation. Stomata are small \nopenings on the plant leaf\
    \ through which gases and water vapor pass. The vaporization occurs within \n\
    the leaf, in the intercellular spaces, and the vapor exchange with the atmosphere\
    \ is controlled by the \nstomatal aperture, which can be open and closed, depending\
    \ on the pressure of the guard cell. Nearly \nall soil water taken up by roots\
    \ is lost by transpiration and a negligible fraction is used within the plant.\
    \ \nNot only the type of crop, but also the crop development, environment, cultural\
    \ management and \nirrigation system should be considered when assessing transpiration.\
    \  \nFor modeling ET, distinctions are made between reference crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0) and actual \nevapotranspiration (ET). ET0 is the evapotranspiration rate\
    \ from a reference surface, not short of water, \nwhich can be a hypothetical\
    \ grass surface with specific characteristics, while ET involves all \nconditions\
    \ of any vegetated surface. Agro-meteorological parameters, vegetation characteristics,\
    \ \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n\
    1291\nmanagement and environmental aspects affect ET. Other factors to be considered\
    \ are ground cover, \nplant density, plant architecture, microclimate and soil\
    \ moisture. Considering irrigated crops, \ncultivation practices and the type\
    \ of irrigation system, can alter the microclimate, affecting the canopy \ncharacteristics\
    \ and the moisture content of the soil and the plants. The effect of soil moisture\
    \ on water \nfluxes is primarily conditioned by the magnitude of the water deficit\
    \ and the type of soil. On the other \nhand, too much water will result in water\
    \ logging, which might damage the root and limit root water \nuptake by inhibiting\
    \ respiration [61].  \nEvapotranspiration is an energy consuming process, referred\
    \ to as the latent heat flux (λE). ET can \nbe derived from the latent heat of\
    \ vaporization (λ), density of water and λE. As a first approximation, \nan ET\
    \ of 1 mm d−1 is equivalent to a λE of 28 W m−2, being therefore the chain between\
    \ the water and \nenergy balances. All energy fluxes should be considered when\
    \ deriving the energy balance equation, \nwhich for a given surface can be written\
    \ as:  \n 0\n\n\n\nG\nH\nE\nRn\n\n \n   (1) \nwhere Rn is the net radiation,\
    \ H is the sensible heat flux and G is the soil heat flux. All terms in \nEquation\
    \ 1 can be expressed in W m−2 or MJ m−2 d−1, being either positive or negative.\
    \ Positive Rn \nmeans energy flux to the surface and positive G, λE and H indicate\
    \ fluxes of energy from the surface. \nEquation 1 states that the Rn is redistributed\
    \ over H, λE and G, considering only vertical fluxes and \nignoring the net rate\
    \ at which energy is being transferred horizontally, by advection; however, this\
    \ \nterm can be significant near the edges of crops or natural vegetation [62].\
    \ Therefore it is accurate only \nwhen applied to large, extensive surfaces. Other\
    \ energy terms, such as heat stored or released in the \ncanopies, or the energy\
    \ used in metabolic activities, are not considered. These last terms account only\
    \ \nfor a small fraction of the daily Rn and can be neglected in hydrological\
    \ studies. \nThe atmosphere warms up when Rn is positive. Heating of the atmosphere\
    \ occurs from the land \nsurface, thus the surface temperature (T0) during daylight\
    \ hours exceeds the air temperature (Ta). H is \nthe rate of heat loss to the\
    \ air by convection and conduction, due to a temperature difference, being \n\
    expressed by the following equation for heat transport [63]:  \nah\na\na p\nr\n\

    \ rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in the boundary above the\
    \ land surface         \n(s m−1) applicable to the same two heights. \nλE can\

    \ \nresistances (s m−1) to the latent heat flux; and es(T0) is the saturated water\
    \ vapor pressure (kPa) at T0. \nThese fundamental equations constitute the base\
    \ for regional ET modeling approaches, which use \nremotely-sensed radiances.\
    \ The transfer equations for H (Equation 2) and for λE (Equation 3) were \ncombined\
    \ [64] into the surface energy balance (Equation 1), and the world wide accepted\
    \ combination \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \

    \ equation was modified into a \nversion that can be applied to the vegetated\
    \ surfaces by inserting a canopy resistance [65], eliminating \nT0 from Equations\
    \ 1–3. \nConsidering rah and rav nearly equal in practice, and replaced by ra\
    \ for both heat and vapor flux \ntransports, the PM equation to predict ET from\
    \ vegetated surfaces [61] became: \n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n r /r )\n (1\n\
    \ \nc D/r\n(R - G)  \nE\na\ns\na\np\na\nn\n \n   (4) \nwhere Δ (kPa C−1) is the\
    \ slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve and D (kPa) is the vapor pressure\
    \ \ndeficit in the air near the vegetated surfaces.  \nThe difficulties of using\
    \ Equation 4, especially at the regional scale, are considered to be the \nestimations\
    \ of ra and rs [66]. Differences in crop height and leaf area index (LAI) determine\
    \ crop \nroughness and thereby ra. Crop rooting characteristics, root water uptake\
    \ and LAI influence the value \nof rs. With the availability of the evapotranspiration\
    \ resistances, ET can be derived from agro-\nmeteorological data by means of Equation\
    \ 4, providing a good approach because it combines the main \ndrivers of water\
    \ fluxes; provides an energy constraint on the water fluxes; and modeled ET are\
    \ not \noverly sensitive to any of the inputs [23]. The magnitude of rs is mainly\
    \ governed by environmental \nentities and soil moisture status [67,68]. Where\
    \ the vegetation does not completely cover the soil, rs \nincludes the effects\
    \ of the soil evaporation. With field values of λE, Rn, G, ra and microclimatic\
    \ data, rs \ncan be estimated inverting Equation 4 [5,13,14], and together with\
    \ remote sensing parameters, the ET \nat the regional scale can be obtained. On\
    \ the other hand, Equation 4 applied to the reference crop \nallows the modeling\
    \ of the ratio ET/ET0 with satellite variables. The next section describes the\
    \ steps \nfor modeling by using the PM equation in these two ways. \n2.1.2. Penman-Monteith\
    \ models \nTable 1 summarizes the steps for modeling the regional ET by the two\
    \ models based on the PM \nequation. For the first model (PM1), the radiation\
    \ balance was done with locally calibrated equations \nand satellite values of\
    \ Rn, G and the evapotranspiration resistances together with weather data, while\
    \ \nfor the second one (PM2), the only remote sensing parameters are the surface\
    \ albedo (α0), the surface \ntemperature (T0) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI). For both models, the ratio \nET/ET0 is applied to grids of ET0\

    \ equations were used for atmospheric correction to obtain the regional values\
    \ of \nα0 and T0 by using field and satellite measurements. The satellite measured\
    \ radiances are affected by \nthe atmospheric interaction in the radiative transfer\
    \ path, being part of the incident global solar \nradiation (RG) scattered back\
    \ before it reaches the earth surface. A simplified linear relationship \nbetween\
    \ α0 measured by pyranometers in the field and the planetary albedo by Landsat\
    \ satellite (αp) \nhas been applied [69]. From the field energy balance experiments,\
    \ the aerodynamic surface \ntemperature (T0) was calculated from Equation 2 while\
    \ the radiometric surface temperature was \nobtained from the Landsat band 6 (Tsat).\
    \ Other than for a thin surface, a difference arises between \nradiometric and\
    \ aerodynamic surface temperatures [70]. Excellent agreement was found between\
    \ \naerodynamic surface and canopy radiometric temperatures for a dense, fully\
    \ closed wheat crop [71], \nhowever, for sparse or composite vegetation, the differences\
    \ increase [72]. The satellite thermal \nradiation was therefore corrected for\
    \ both atmospheric emission and the difference between \nradiometric and surface\
    \ temperature by applying a regression equation with field and satellite values\
    \ \n(Table 1).  \nConsidering that the field measurements involved contrasting\
    \ hydrological surfaces with different \nvalues for α0; for the use of the Equation\
    \ 2 for estimating T0, microclimatic measurements with \nstability corrections\
    \ were applied to ra in flux profile relationships. Since EC systems directly\
    \ provide \nu*, with good agreements of H when comparing field and satellite values\
    \ [27], it is assumed that the \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n          \n \n \n\

    \ good accuracy in the semi-arid region of the Low-Middle \nSão Francisco river\
    \ basin. \nIn the regional radiation balance (Figure 1), the net short wave radiation\
    \ available at the earth \nsurface depends on RG and α0.  \nMeasured RL↓ over\
    \ natural vegetation (caatinga)—in combination with microclimatic data of air\
    \ \ntemperature (Ta)—accorded the inspection of the apparent emissivity of the\
    \ atmosphere (a). The \nregional values of RL↓ were then estimated from the Stefan\
    \ Boltzman equation by using the relation of \na with the atmospheric transmissivity\
    \ (τsw) together with grids of Ta from the net of  \nagro-meteorological stations.\
    \ τsw was, in turn, calculated by the ratio of the grid of RG measured by the\
    \ \nnet of pyrometers and the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (Ra)\
    \ [27]. For RL↑, the Stefan \nBoltzman equation was applied using images of T0\
    \ and the correlation of field values of surface \nemissivity (ε0) and satellite\
    \ measurements of NDVI [73], this last parameter being obtained from the \ninfrared\
    \ and red regions of the Landsat images.  \nThe regional values of Rn resulted\
    \ from the balance of all short and long wave radiations (Figure 1). \nThe term\
    \ G in large scale was acquired by an exponential relation of field values of\
    \ the ratio G/Rn and \nα0, assuming that both ratios are dependent on the type\
    \ and architecture of the vegetation and soil \nmoisture conditions and that the\
    \ exponential relation was the best found for comparing the two ratios \ninvolving\
    \ natural vegetation and irrigated crops (R2 = 0.96) under several hydrological\
    \ conditions in \nsemi-arid region of Brazil (Table 1).  \nThe behavior of z0m\
    \ in natural vegetation and irrigated crops was described for the semi-arid \n\
    conditions of the Low-Middle São Francisco river basin [14]. To estimate this\
    \ roughness parameter at \nthe regional scale from remote sensing measurements,\
    \ a simplified expression based on α0 from field \nmeasurements and NDVI from\
    \ satellite images, with locally calibrated regression coefficients shown in \n\
    Table 1 was used. The inclusion of α0 helps to distinguish between vegetation\
    \ having different \narchitecture but similar values of NDVI [48]. For example\
    \ table grape may present the same NDVI \nvalues as mango orchard, but substantially\
    \ lower LAI. The coefficient of determination is rather \nencouraging for describing\
    \ a difficult land surface parameter by some simplified remote  \nsensing variables.\
    \ \nFor the PM1 model, ra was estimated from the roughness length for heat transport\
    \ (z0h), which in \nturn was considered as a function of z0m (z0h = 0.1 z0m) [61].\
    \ This relation is very useful, as there is no \nunique relationship between surface\
    \ roughness characteristics such as the geometry of the roughness \nelements and\
    \ z0h [74,75]. The low determination coefficient in Table 1 is not a problem,\
    \ because \nEquation 4 is insensitive to ra, especially when ra << rs and at daily\
    \ timescales [23]. Finally, to \ncomplete the resistance terms in the PM equation,\
    \ the field values of rs were correlated with the field \nvalues of T0, α0 and\
    \ satellite measurements of NDVI. For PM2 model, the instantaneous ET/ET0 field\
    \ \nvalues were also modeled with field values of T0 and α0 together with satellite\
    \ data of NDVI (Table 1).  \nFigure 2 presents the schematic overview to convert\
    \ spectral radiance into ET by using the satellite \nparameters and the grids\
    \ of daily ET0 when applying the PM2 model.  \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n   \

    \ \nAfter converting the spectral radiances and the atmospheric corrections, the\
    \ images of NDVI, α0 \nand T0 are the only input parameters for estimating the\
    \ instantaneous values of the ratio ET/ET0 \nwithout the need of the regional\
    \ radiation balance shown in Figure 1. The instantaneous values of this \nratio\
    \ are multiplied by the daily grids of ET0 to estimate the regional ET for 24\
    \ hours.  \nBoth, rs and ET/ET0 values are related to the soil moisture conditions\
    \ and so are the remote sensing \nvegetation indicators such as NDVI, α0 and T0.\
    \ Based on this principle, two models were proposed. \nThe relationship between\
    \ vegetation indices with soil moisture and ET rates have been reported in the\
    \ \nsemi-arid region of Brazil [14,27]. The relations for modeling the regional\
    \ ET in a mixture of natural \nvegetation and irrigated crops are depicted in\
    \ Figure 3. \nFor the first model based on direct application of Equation 4 (PM1),\
    \ the images of Rn, G, rs and ra, \nare used together with the interpolated weather\
    \ data from the net of agro-meteorological stations \n(Table 1; Figures 1, 3a\
    \ and 3b). The regional values of λE are acquired and transformed into \nmillimeters\
    \ of water (ET). After the determination of ET at the regional scale, the instantaneous\
    \ ratio \nof ET/ET0 is calculated with grids of ET0 for these same spatial and\
    \ time scales. The second model \n(PM2) is based on the modeling of ET/ET0 at\
    \ the satellite overpass time (subscript sat) at the regional \nscale (Table 1\
    \ and Figure 3c). The instantaneous images of ET/ET0 obtained by both models are\
    \ then \nmultiplied by the grids of ET0 for 24 hours. \nThe satellite overpass\
    \ time values of ET/ET0 and those for 24 hours in irrigated mango orchard and\
    \ \ncaatinga were compared (Figure 3d). The slope is close to one, supporting\
    \ the assumption that \ninstantaneous and daily ratios can be considered equal.\
    \ A factor of 1.18 for the evaporative fraction \n[EF = λE/(Rn − G)] was necessary\
    \ to extrapolate the latent heat fluxes from satellite overpass to daily \ntime\

    \ Agro-Meteorological Stations \nThe São Francisco river basin encompasses several\
    \ Brazilian states with a size of 636,920 km2. It is \ndivided into four physiographic\
    \ regions: The Upper, the Middle, the Low-Middle and the Lower São \nFrancisco\
    \ sub basins. The upstream region has an average annual precipitation of more\
    \ than 2,000 mm. \nIn the semi-arid and arid zones of the states of Bahia and\
    \ Pernambuco, the rainfall drops to less than \n350 mm yr−1. Near the mouth of\
    \ the river, oceanic influence gradually increases rainfall again to about \n\
    1,300 mm yr−1. More than 50% of the territory of the basin is located in the semi-arid\
    \ region of Brazil \nin the northeastern part of the country. Disturbed currents\
    \ of South, North, East and West influence the \nclimatology of this region. Excluding\
    \ the places of high altitude, all areas in the Low-Middle sub-basin \npresent\
    \ annual averaged air temperatures higher than 24 °C, even higher than 26 °C in\

    \ the partition of the net available energy into sensible and \nlatent heat fluxes\
    \ in vineyards, while in mango orchard and natural vegetation (caatinga) this\
    \ was done \nby EC measurements [5,13,14].  \nIn both vineyards (wine grape and\
    \ table grape), the sensors were installed at the centre of the plots \nshown\
    \ in Figure 4 and described in Table 3. The wine grape was trained vertically\
    \ at a height of 1.6 m \nwith the plants spaced at 1.2 m × 3.5 m, while the table\
    \ grape was spaced at 3.5 m × 4.0 m with an \noverhead horizontal trellis system\
    \ of 1.8 m. The gradients of air temperature and vapor pressure were \ncalculated\
    \ by wet and dry thermocouples of copper/constantan at 0.5 and 1.5 m above the\
    \ canopies. \nThe surface albedo (α0 = RR/RG) was measured through incident (RG)\
    \ and reflected (RR) global solar \nradiation acquired with pyranometers faced\
    \ up and down (model Eppley, number 19,579, Rhode \nIsland, RI, USA). The net\
    \ radiation (Rn) was measured over the canopies with two net radiometers \n(model\
    \ NR-Lite, Kipp & Zonnen, Delft, the Netherlands). All radiation sensors were\
    \ placed at 1 m \nabove the canopies. The soil heat flux (G) was obtained with\
    \ four heat flux plates (HFT3-L, REBS, \nRadiation and Energy Balance Systems,\
    \ Seattle, WA and Hukseflux, Delft, the Netherlands) at 2 cm \nsoil depth and\
    \ 0.5 m from the plants. Wind speed was measured with anemometers (R. M., Young\
    \ \nwind Sentry, 03101, MI, USA) at two levels, i.e., 1.0 and 2.0 m above the\
    \ canopies. Air temperature \nand relative humidity at 0.5 m from the leaves were\
    \ obtained with probes from Vaisala (model HMP \n35A, Helsinki, Finland) and Sky\
    \ (SKH 2013, Sky instruments LTD, Llandrindod Wells, UK).  \nRemote Sens. 2010,\

    \ λE and H were calculated by using the Bowen ratio, as a function of the gradients\
    \ \nof air temperature and vapor pressure above the canopies. Missing or erroneous\
    \ ET data from BR \nsystem were filled by using the relation of λE with the available\
    \ energy (Rn − G) for specific periods of \ntime. As the vineyards are inside\
    \ large irrigated farms, with several plots with the same crop, the BR \nmethod\
    \ is considered accurate with H representing only 12 and 18% of Rn for table and\
    \ wine grapes, \nrespectively [5,14]. \nThe EC system (EC) in mango orchard determined\
    \ H and λE by a three-axis sonic anemometer \n(Model CSAT3, Campbell Scientific,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA) and a krypton hygrometer (Model KH20, \nCampbell Scientific,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA), respectively. The trees were spaced in a regular square pattern\
    \ \nat 10 m × 10 m, with an average height of 5.5 m. The sensors were set at 3\
    \ m above the crown of a tree \nwith a sampling frequency of 16 Hz. Corrections\
    \ to water flux due to density fluctuations introduced \nby the fluxes of sensible\
    \ and latent heat flux [79], oxygen absorption [80] and frequency losses [81]\
    \ \nwere applied. Rn was acquired with one net radiometer (model NR-Lite, Kipp\
    \ & Zonnen, Delft, the \nNetherlands) at a height of 2.5 m above the canopy. At\
    \ this same height the surface albedo was \nmeasured with pyranometers faced up\
    \ and down (model Eppley, number 19579, RI, USA). The soil \nheat flux (G) was\
    \ acquired with two heat flux plates (model HFT3-L, REBS, Radiation and Energy\
    \ \nBalance Systems, Seattle, WA, USA) at 2 cm soil depth and bellow the projected\
    \ tree crown at 100 cm \nfrom the trunk. Air temperature and relative humidity\
    \ near the leaves were measured with a probe \n(SKH 2013, Sky instruments LTD,\
    \ Llandrindod Wells, UK) installed at the same height of the \nradiation sensors\
    \ [13,14].  \nThe EC system over caatinga was installed at 11 m height above the\
    \ ground. The natural vegetation \nis a mixture of species with a mean height\
    \ of 8 m. The system consisted of a sonic anemometer from \nthe same manufacturer\
    \ as for mango orchard and a gas analyzer (LI7500, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) \n\
    with the same sampling frequency, datalogger and corrections as for mango orchard.\
    \ All components \nof short and long wave radiation were measured with pyranometers\
    \ and pyrgeometers facing up and \ndown (Kipp & Zonnen, Delft, the Netherlands)\
    \ at a height of 10 m from the ground. Rn was acquired \nwith a net radiometer\
    \ at the same height of the other radiation sensors and G was measured with one\
    \ \nflux plate at 2 cm soil depth. Both the net radiometer and the flux plates\
    \ were from the same \nmanufacturer as for mango orchard. Microclimatic measurements\
    \ of air temperature and relative \nhumidity were taken above the vegetation with\
    \ a probe from Vaisala (model HMP 45C-L, Helsinki, \nFinland) at the same height\
    \ of the radiation sensors. \nThe data quality from EC systems, in mango orchard\
    \ and caatinga, was verified by studying the \nenergy balance closure: fluxes\
    \ (λE + H) and available energy (Rn − G) were compared at a daily time \nscale,\
    \ being 88%, with a RMSE of 1.7 MJ m−2 d−1, evidenced the good quality of the\
    \ dataset. The gaps \nin ET data from the EC systems, mainly during the rainy\
    \ periods for the krypton data in mango \norchard, were filled by the equation\
    \ resulting from the energy closure. A closure error of 10 to 30% \nseems to occur\
    \ frequently with EC—based latent heat flux estimates. A summary paper of 22 flux\
    \ sites \nindicated a general lack, with a mean imbalance in the order of 20%\
    \ [82]. Available energy \nsystematically exceeding measured fluxes have been\
    \ published [83,84,85]. The lack of energy balance \nclosure can also be associated\
    \ with measurement errors in Rn and G, but not completely explained by \nthis\
    \ uncertainty, because EC systems have their own sources of error [83]. Further\
    \ to systematic biases \nin the instrumentation, the general hypothesis about\
    \ this lack can be explained by sampling errors \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n\

    \ and 0.34 mm d−1, for PM1 and PM2, respectively). While this \nlast model fitted\
    \ more the line 1:1, explaining 89% of the variance, the PM1 model, explaining\
    \ 79% of \nthe variance, overestimated the field values for the low ET rates of\
    \ natural vegetation.  \nThe lower regression coefficient and higher RMSE for\
    \ the PM1 model can be due to the fact that \nthe weather data from the agro-meteorological\
    \ stations are not representative of the microclimatic \nconditions of the caatinga.\
    \ One can see in Figure 5 that better results of PM1 is for higher values of \n\
    ET, corresponding to irrigated crops, independently of their microclimate, as\
    \ the agro-meteorological \nstations are inside of irrigated areas. Actual projects\

    \ of R2 = 0.78, a RMSE of \n39.7 W m−2, and an average deviation of 5%. The differences\
    \ occurred typically for the lower values \nbecause the weather data used in Equation\
    \ 4 are from agro-meteorological stations inside of irrigated \nareas. This is\
    \ confirmed by the good correlation shown in the scatter plot of the available\
    \ energy (AE), \nwith a R2 = 0.91 and a RMSE of 38.6 W m−2. In general the AE\
    \ satellite values overestimated the field \nvalues a little, which was due to\
    \ an overestimation in Rn. Despite this overestimation, excellent \nagreement\
    \ was found for Rn, with an R2 of 0.92 and a RMSE of only 21.8 W m−2. This overestimation\
    \ \ncould be related to the low coefficient of determination for εa together with\
    \ an underestimation in α0 \n(Table 1). The largest differences from the line\
    \ 1:1 were found for G, however still with good \nstatistical results (R2 = 0.85\
    \ and RMSE of 21.7 W m−2). The biggest distances were verified for higher \nvalues,\
    \ representative of caatinga where G was measured with just one flux plate. \n\
    In the case of PM2, all the calculations for obtaining Rn and G are not necessary\
    \ (Table 1 and \nFigure 1). The ratio ET/ET0 is directly modeled with only three\
    \ remote sensing parameters, which are \nrelated to vegetation. In addition, there\
    \ is a small difference between the instantaneous and daily values \nRemote Sens.\

    \ (GIS) \nyield a better characterization of the spatial climatic variation and,\
    \ in case of the satellite without \nthermal bands, one can incorporate grids\
    \ of Ta instead of images of T0 in applying the equation for \nET/ET0 estimation\
    \ from Table 1, with different regression coefficients, even with lower accuracy.\
    \ \nAlthough Ta being affected by each surface, the inclusion of α0 and NDVI can\
    \ reduce the errors, \nbecause these last remote sensing parameters are characteristics\
    \ of the different kind of vegetation and \nmoisture status. When Ta was used\
    \ instead T0 in the relation for ET/ET0 in Table 1 the coefficients \nbecame a\
    \ = 2.3 and b = −0.011 with a R2 of 0.82. These last statistical results showed\
    \ the suitability for \nusing grids of Ta in the case of a satellite with high\
    \ spatial resolution but without a thermal band. The \npossibility of using interpolated\
    \ weather data, including Ta, together with remotely vegetative indexes \navailable\
    \ from MODIS images, has been demonstrated for ET regionalization in Australia\
    \ [23]. \nAnother advantage of the PM2 model is that it can be applied without\
    \ the need to identify the \nextreme conditions, being also suitable for the rainy\
    \ periods. The local calibrated SEBAL algorithm \nwas tested in the Low-Middle\
    \ São Francisco river basin [27] with good agreement between field and \nLandsat\
    \ measurements of daily ET (R2 of 0.91 and RMSE of 0.38 mm d−1). However, to consider\
    \ the \nnecessary extreme conditions, EC towers were used for flux measurements\
    \ in hydrological contrasting \nsurfaces in the study region, to not consider\
    \ ET null during the rainy season. The disadvantage is that \nEC systems are costly\
    \ and operationally difficult, as compared with the parameterizations of the PM2\
    \ \nmodel, which needs only three satellite parameters and permanent agro-meteorological\
    \ stations, which \nwould also be useful for other important crop management applications\
    \ such as ET-based  \nirrigation scheduling. \nConsidering the better performance\
    \ and simplicity of PM2, it was chosen and tested whether it is \nsufficiently\
    \ robust and accurate for the task of ET determination at different spatial scales\
    \ in the  \nLow-Middle São Francisco river basin. In addition, the relation for\
    \ rs depicted in Table 1 and Figure 3a \nwas used for the classification of irrigated\
    \ areas and natural vegetation. Furthermore both parameters rs \nand ET/ET0 can\
    \ be useful to infer soil water conditions. Because of the reasons explained for\
    \ using the \nmodeled ratio ET/ET0 together with grids of daily ET0, it was concluded\
    \ that this approach has \nconsiderable potential for estimating ET at different\
    \ time and spatial scales in hydrological basins with \nthe availability of agro-meteorological\
    \ stations. The challenges faced to make the model applicable in \nother river\
    \ basins are the implementation of a net of agro-meteorological stations to combine\
    \ weather \ndata with satellites measurements at different spatial and temporal\
    \ resolutions and to test the algorithm \nover a more diverse range of ecosystems.\
    \ \n3.2. Land Use Change \nEven with PM1 model not being chosen for ET calculations,\
    \ the equation for rs shown in Table 1 \nand in Figure 3a was applied to infer\
    \ the soil moisture conditions for a simplified vegetation \nclassification. The\
    \ satellite images of the study region were layered with the shapes of the main\
    \ fruit \ngrowing regions in the Pernambuco (Petrolina, Lagoa Grande and Santa\
    \ Maria da Boa Vista) and \nBahia (Juazeiro and Casa Nova) states, involved by\
    \ the net of agro-meteorological stations to identify \nthe main direction of\
    \ the quick land use change, highlighting the best possibility for the  \nirrigation\

    \ shows rs values \nhigher than 800 s m−1 during this dry period of the year.\
    \ Inside the wet period there is more \nhomogeneity in the whole area and both,\
    \ irrigated and not irrigated vegetated areas, present values \nlower than 800\
    \ s m−1. The relation of rs with soil moisture shows the suitability of estimating\
    \ this last \nimportant water variable in semi-arid regions which involve a mixture\
    \ of ecosystems. According to the \nlocation of the field experiments shown in\
    \ Figure 4, the maximum values are for caatinga (average of \n1,937 s m−1). Wine\
    \ grape and mango orchard present similar values around 130 s m−1, while table\
    \ \ngrapes present the lowest ones, averaging 74 s m−1 [14]. \nConsidering that\
    \ the quick land use change by the replacement of natural vegetation with irrigated\
    \ \ncrops can cause environmental problems, it becomes very important to make\
    \ a historical picture at the \ngrowing regions level about this replacement.\

    \ 2002 to 2006 for the growing regions involved in the net of  \nagro-meteorological\

    \ 800 s m−1 and multiplying this \nnumber by the area of each pixel. Images of\
    \ 2001 and 2003 were interpolated to give the situation for \n2002 and the image\
    \ of 2006 gave the situation for this year (Table 4). \nAlthough Petrolina-PE\

    \ the years (2002–2006) are lower (213 and 171%) than those for Santa Maria-PE\

    \ significant period was from 2005 to 2006 in Juazeiro-BA (129%). The agricultural\

    \ PM2 model uses the ratio ET/ET0, the values of this ratio were also investigated\
    \ for the same \nperiods of the year as for rs (Figure 10). \nFigure 10. Images\
    \ of the satellite overpass ET/ET0 for the region comprised of the net of \nagro-meteorological\

    \ January 2007.  \n(a\n(b\n(a)\n(b) \nThe same effects of the soil moisture conditions\
    \ are evidenced as in the case of rs. During the dry \nconditions (Figure 10a),\
    \ the ET/ET0 values for irrigated crops are near 1.00 because the water supply\
    \ \nreduces the heat losses to the atmosphere while for caatinga this ratio ranges\
    \ from 0.00 to 0.20, as it \nconverts the biggest part of the available energy\
    \ into H during this period of the year. Inside the wet \nseason (Figure 10b),\
    \ the moisture conditions are more homogeneous, making the values for caatinga\
    \ in \nsome cases around 0.50, similar to those for irrigated crops. During this\
    \ season, a higher portion of the \navailable energy in natural vegetation is\
    \ converted into λE and, in most commercial farms, the \nirrigation is stopped\
    \ while the rainfall keeps the soil uniformly wet for all ecosystems. For complete\
    \ \ngrowing seasons, crops with micro sprinkler system in general present mean\
    \ values of ET/ET0 around \n0.90, while for drip irrigated systems they are around\
    \ 0.75–0.80. Considering the period of the year, \ninvolving different soil moisture\
    \ conditions, the average value for caatinga is 0.30 [78].  \nThe variation of\
    \ the modeled ET/ET0 ratio with these extreme seasonal moisture conditions and\
    \ the \nsimilarity with field values is encouraging to simulate timing and magnitude\
    \ of ET, capturing the \nstrong contrast between the four sites depicted in Figure\
    \ 4. The ratio can also be a good option as an \ninput parameter for the soil\
    \ moisture estimations at the regional scale, similar to the EF reported in the\
    \ \ninternational literature. Values of EF for irrigated cotton and perennial\
    \ vegetation (vineyards and \norchards) were found varying from 0.40, when the\
    \ crops started to be irrigated, to 0.70–0.90 during the \nirrigation season in\
    \ the Gediz basin (Turkey) [87]. A grazing steppe in central Mongolia presented\
    \ \nseasonal values of EF following the variation in leaf areas and rainfall events\
    \ during the dry-wet  \ncycles [88]. For a tropical watershed in the Kenyan Rift\
    \ Valley with natural meadows, the values of EF \nwere 0.70 during the wet season\
    \ and 0.10 during the dry season [89]. The behavior of ET/ET0 for \nRemote Sens.\

    \ study was thus \nsimilar to the behavior of EF reported in the literature. \n\
    The daily values of ET involving different periods of the year (before, just after,\
    \ and during the \nrainy season) in the study region are presented in Figure 11.\

    \ comprised of the net of agro-meteorological \nstations presents similar values\
    \ of ET, with the exception of water bodies. Intermediate values in \nnatural\
    \ vegetation occur just after the rainy season (Figure 11b), because antecedent\
    \ precipitation \nduring January to April provides sufficient water storage in\
    \ the caatinga root zone still keeping the \nbushes wet and green, despite the\
    \ quick rise of the atmospheric demand in the second half of the year. \nAs a\
    \ consequence of the higher portions of the available energy converted into H,\
    \ during the driest \nperiod of the year (Figure 11c), the natural vegetation\
    \ presents low values of ET, while the irrigated \nfields show the highest ones.\
    \ In general, irrigation intervals are short (daily irrigation), and the water\
    \ \nsupply is uniform, reducing the heat losses to the atmosphere. According to\
    \ Figure 11, the effect of the \nsoil moisture in the magnitude of the ET rates\
    \ is strong. Pixels with values lower than 1.0 mm d−1 \noccur during the dry season\

    \ 4, the highest accumulated \nregional ET values in 2006 (Figure 12) are for\

    \ values, ranging from 450 to 800 mm yr-1, while in caatinga they were \nbetween\
    \ 200 and 400 mm yr−1. Considering that mango orchards are cultivated during the\
    \ whole year \nand the cultivation of table grapes are restricted to the dry seasons,\
    \ it can be concluded that irrigated \nmango orchards and vineyards consumed more\
    \ water per area than caatinga by factors of 3 and  \n2, respectively. \nThe classification\

    \ considering all growing \nregions comprised of the agro-meteorological stations\
    \ and a continuous cultivation throughout the year \nfor both crops, the annual\
    \ mango orchards water consumption is a little lower than for vineyards. \nThese\
    \ cropped areas represent 19.4 and 8.2% of the total irrigated area, respectively,\
    \ resulting in a total \nevaporative depletion of 0.22 km3 yr−1. The incremental\

    \ as being 2.2 mm d−1 on average [78]. Considering all growing \nregions from\
    \ Tables 6 and 7, the additional volume of water used was around 0.77 mm yr−1\
    \ in 2006. \nThe latter volume represents the net depletion, the difference between\

    \ to evapotranspiration, while the second uses the estimated ratio of the \nactual\
    \ to the reference evapotranspiration (PM2). The PM1 model presented a regression\
    \ coefficient of \n0.79 and a root mean square error of 0.44 mm d−1, whereas for\
    \ the best results of the PM2 model, the \ncorrespondent values were 0.89 and\
    \ 0.34 mm d−1. The second model fitted more the line 1:1, \nexplaining 89% of\
    \ the variance and the first model explained 79% of the variance. The lower \n\
    performance of PM1 model could be due to the fact that the weather data from the\
    \ agro-meteorological \nstations are not representative of the dry microclimatic\
    \ conditions of the natural vegetation. \nEven with the PM1 model not being chosen\
    \ for ET calculations, the equation for surface resistance \nwas applied to infer\
    \ the soil moisture conditions for a simplified vegetation classification. The\
    \ \nmaximum values of surface resistance were for natural vegetation—caatinga\
    \ (average of 1,937 s m−1). \nWine grape and mango orchard presented similar values\
    \ around 130 s m−1, while table grape presented \nthe lowest ones, averaging 74\
    \ s m−1. Petrolina and Juazeiro, in Pernambuco (PE) and Bahia (BA) \nstates, respectively,\
    \ were highlighted with the biggest irrigated areas.  \nThe most important commercially\
    \ irrigated crops in the semi-arid region of Brazil are vineyards and \nmango\
    \ orchards, being the main responsible vegetation for the quick land use change,\
    \ growing mainly \nin Petrolina-PE and Juazeiro-BA. In the case of Petrolina-PE,\
    \ the larger increase is for vineyards, \nwhile in Juazeiro-BA the biggest area\
    \ is for mango orchards. The highest increment for the first crop \nwas verified\
    \ between 2003 and 2004 in Petrolina-PE, when the cultivated area increased 151%.\
    \ In the \ncase of mango orchards the most significant period was from 2005 to\
    \ 2006 in Juazeiro-BA (129%). \nAfter having been identified as the best performance,\
    \ the PM2 model was used to analyze the \nevapotranspiration from irrigated crops\
    \ and natural vegetation. Considering the daily rates of the \nregional evapotranspiration,\
    \ pixels with values lower than 1.0 mm d−1 occurred outside the rainy \nseason,\
    \ representing the caatinga species. Values from 1.0 to 5.0 mm d-1 during the\
    \ driest conditions of \nthe year coincided with irrigated crops, being the highest\
    \ values for table grapes. The highest \naccumulated ET values during 2006 were\
    \ for mango orchards, being around 500–1,300 mm yr−1. \nVineyards presented lower\
    \ values, ranging from 450–800 mm yr−1, while in the natural vegetation \n(caatinga)\
    \ they were between 200 and 400 mm yr−1. It could be concluded that irrigated\
    \ mango \norchards and vineyards consumed more water than caatinga by factors\
    \ of 3 and 2, respectively.  \nPetrolina and Juazeiro in the semi-arid regions\
    \ of Pernambuco and Bahia states presented the \nhighest evapotranspiration rates,\
    \ mainly as a consequence of land use change with the replacement of \nnatural\
    \ vegetation by vineyards and mango orchards. Analyzing land use together with\
    \ the regional \nevapotranspiration for 2006 the regional evapotranspiration rates\
    \ for these growing regions were 0.23 \nand 0.18 km3 yr−1. Although the first\
    \ growing region presented higher rates than the second, the \nirrigated area\
    \ was lower: this could be a combined effect of irrigation water excess together\
    \ with \ngreater evaporative demand. The mango orchards and vineyard areas, representing\
    \ 19.4 and 8.2% of \nthe total irrigated area respectively, resulted in a total\
    \ evaporative depletion of 0.22 km3 yr−1 in the \ngrowing region covered by the\
    \ agro-meteorological stations.  \nThe separation of irrigated crops was possible\
    \ by a simplified classification with logical functions \napplied to the surface\
    \ resistance values. The incremental ET in the Low Middle São Francisco river\
    \ \nbasin was reported as being 2.2 mm d−1 on average [78]. Considering all growing\
    \ regions analyzed, the \nadditional volume of water used was around 0.77 mm yr−1\
    \ in 2006. The latter volume represents the \nRemote Sens. 2010, 2  \n \n    \
    \      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n1313\nnet depletion, the difference\
    \ between diversion and return flow that is truly consumed and no longer \navailable\
    \ for downstream urban and environmental users. \nThe results were rather encouraging\
    \ given the complex mixture of the ecosystems in the semi-arid \nconditions, considering\
    \ that only maps of NDVI, surface albedo and surface temperature together with\
    \ \ninterpolated data of reference evapotranspiration are necessary, without the\
    \ need of crop classification, \nwhich is not straightforward in fruit crops.\
    \ However, if the satellite does not have a thermal band, there \nis also the\
    \ possibility of using grids of air temperature together with remote sensing parameters\
    \ instead \nof surface temperature obtained from satellite measurements.  \nThe\
    \ actual condition of the evolution of the irrigated areas over the natural vegetation\
    \ is an \nindication of the importance of having efficient tools for rational\
    \ water resources management as water \nconflicts are imminent. With the use of\
    \ remote sensing together with a net of agro-meteorological \nstations, one can\
    \ make an historical evaluation of the evapotranspiration at the regional scale\
    \ in the \nsemi-arid areas of Brazil. The tools tested and presented here can\
    \ be operationally tested and \nimplemented to monitor the increase of irrigated\
    \ agriculture, subsidizing ways to avoid environmental \ndamage in hydrological\
    \ basins with increasing land use change. \nAcknowledgements \nThe research herein\

    Abstract Alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration ( ET r ) values sometimes need to
    be converted to grass-reference ET ( ET o ) , or vice versa, to enable crop coefficients
    developed for one reference surface to be used with the other. However, guidelines
    to make these conversions are lacking. The objectives of this study were to: (1)
    develop ET r to ET o ratios ( K r values) for different climatic regions for the
    growing season and nongrowing (dormant) seasons; and (2) determine the seasonal
    behavior of K r values between the locations and in the same location for different
    seasons. Monthly average K r values from daily values were developed for Bushland,
    (Tex.), Clay Center, (Neb.), Davis, (Calif.), Gainesville, (Fla.), Phoenix (Ariz.),
    and Rockport, (Mo.) for the calendar year and for the growing season (May–September).
    ET r and ET o values that were used to determine K r values were calculated by
    several methods. Methods included the standardized American Society of Civil Engineers
    Penman–Monteith (ASCE-PM), Food and Agriculture Organization Paper 56 (FAO56)
    equation (68), 1972 and 1982 Kimberly-Penman, 1963 Jensen-Haise, and the High
    Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC) Penman. The K r values determined by the
    same and different methods exhibited substantial variations among locations. For
    example, the K r values developed with the ASCE-PM method in July were 1.38, 1.27,
    1.32, 1.11, 1.28, and 1.19, for Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, Gainesville, Phoenix,
    and Rockport, respectively. The variability in the K r values among locations
    justifies the need for developing local K r values because the values did not
    appear to be transferable among locations. In general, variations in K r values
    were less for the growing season than for the calendar year. Average standard
    deviation between years was maximum 0.13 for the calendar year and maximum 0.10
    for the growing season. The ASCE-PM K r values had less variability among locations
    than those obtained with other methods. The FAO56 procedure K r values had higher
    variability among locations, especially for areas with low relative humidity and
    high wind speed. The 1972 Kim-Pen method resulted in the closest K r values compared
    with the ASCE-PM method at all locations. Some of the methods, including the ASCE-PM,
    produced potentially unrealistically high K r values (e.g., 1.78, 1.80) during
    the nongrowing season, which could be due to instabilities and uncertainties that
    exist when estimating ET r and ET o in dormant season since the hypothetical reference
    conditions are usually not met during this period in most locations. Because simultaneous
    and direct measurements of the ET r and ET o values rarely exist, it appears that
    the approach of ET r to ET o ratios calculated with the ASCE-PM method is currently
    the best approach available to derive K r values for locations where these measurements
    are not available. The K r values developed in this study can be useful for making
    conversions from ET r to ET o , or vice versa, to enable using crop coefficients
    developed for one reference surface with the other to determine actual crop water
    use for locations, with similar climatic characteristics of this study, when locally
    measured K r values are not available. Introduction Accurate crop water use estimates
    are essential for the development of modern irrigation management methodologies,
    optimum allocation of water and energy resources, and improved irrigation planning
    and management practices. Reference evapotranspiration ( ET ref ) adjusted with
    the crop coefficient ( K c ) approach continues to be one of the most commonly
    used procedures for estimating crop water requirements ( ET c ) . This is a practical
    method because it provides a conservative means of estimating ET c at progressive
    stages of crop development. Historically, grass and alfalfa have been used as
    the two reference surfaces for computing ET c under a variety of climatic conditions.
    Ideally, using grass-reference ET ( ET o ) or alfalfa-reference ET ( ET r ) to
    quantify ET c should result in similar values. There is no consensus on which
    reference surface should be chosen for a particular region, but the choice could
    be a function of climate characteristics of a local region or location. For example,
    alfalfa may be preferable for semiarid or arid climates because alfalfa tends
    to transpire water at potential rates even under advective environments. Also,
    alfalfa has a vigorous and deeper root structure and is, therefore, less likely
    to suffer water stress compared with a shallow-rooted grass crop. In places such
    as humid, subtropical climates where alfalfa is not commonly grown the grass reference
    may be preferable. The K c values used to estimate ET c change during the growing
    season and reflect the integrated effects of environmental, crop, and soil management
    factors such as leaf area, plant height, rate of crop development, crop planting
    date, and soil and weather conditions. All of these factors are imbedded in the
    K c values during the development of the coefficients. Under the same conditions,
    the ET rate for grass is usually less than for alfalfa, particularly under dry,
    hot, and windy conditions. Part of the reason for this is that the alfalfa crop
    that is taken as a reference is taller ( 0.5 m ) than a grass-reference crop (
    0.12 m ) and also has a greater leaf area (ASCE-EWRI 2005). Alfalfa also has greater
    aerodynamic and surface conductance (Wright et al. 2000). Thus, the K c values
    for a given crop will be smaller when alfalfa is used as a reference surface compared
    with the grass reference surface. The K c values for specific crops have been
    developed to be used with generally one of the two reference crops. Therefore,
    K c values for grass-reference ( K c o ) and alfalfa-reference ( K c r ) cannot
    be used interchangeably with ET r or ET o when computing ET c and a correction
    factor would be necessary for adjustment. Most agricultural weather station networks
    report either ET r or ET o values. For a local region the weather station network
    may be reporting ET r , but the K c o values may be more commonly available. In
    this case, either the weather network needs to report ET o or the K c o values
    need to be converted to K c r values to determine ET c . Another important need
    to make the conversions arises when empirical temperature or radiation-based equations
    need to be used to determine ET c from long-term climate data. Although the role
    of the “older” temperature or radiation-based models in ET estimations is somewhat
    diminishing they still have important roles to play under certain conditions.
    In some cases long-term (i.e., 50 – 60 years or longer) water use information
    is needed to asses the long-term hydrological balances of a given watershed and
    other purposes such as determining or assessing the sustainability and/or impact
    of the irrigation development. In this case one of the “older” noncombination
    equations has to be used because of the unavailability of all input parameters
    to solve one of the “modern” combination equations (i.e., FAO56-PM, ASCE-PM) from
    the limited climate data. Thus, the “older” ET models have to be used with the
    appropriate K c values to determine ET c . However, if a grass-based “older” ET
    equation is being used to determine ET o but measured K c r values are available
    locally, then the K c r values need to be converted to K c o to determine ET c
    . Although the user may have an option to use an “older” alfalfa-reference ET
    equation, in many cases the availability of the climate data necessary to compute
    ET o or ET r rather than the availability of the K c values dictates the decision
    on which the ET equation is used. Procedures are also needed to convert ET r and
    ET o values obtained with different ET ref methods. A literature review revealed
    that there is no standard or suggested procedure for making the conversions between
    the two reference surfaces. An extremely limited number of ET r to ET o ratios
    ( K r values) reported in the literature are not consistent and show significant
    variations and they are limited to only one or two locations. For instance, Jensen
    et al. (1990) used K r = 1.15 , but stated that this value did not fully reflect
    differences in climatic conditions among locations. The K r values could change
    with climate due to changes in aerodynamic ( r a ) and stomatal ( r s ) resistance.
    Allen et al. (1994) reported K r values from lysimeter sites for different climates,
    including six arid and five humid locations. The locations were classified as
    arid or humid if the mean daily relative humidity of the peak month was lower
    or greater than 60%. Contrary to the K r values reported by Jensen et al. (1990)
    the average K r values ranged from 1.30 to 1.38 and from 1.12 to 1.39 for arid
    and humid locations, respectively. They reported that, in reality, air temperature,
    humidity, and wind speed above the evaporating surfaces are moderated by vapor
    flux and energy exchange at the surface. Therefore, calculated K r values may
    be 5–10% higher than those that occur under field conditions. They concluded that
    the average value of 1.20 to 1.25 rather than 1.15 may have been more representative
    of the lysimeter sites that were evaluated. Regardless of the absolute accuracy
    of the K r values obtained in their study, the variation among K r values suggests
    that the magnitude of K c values, when calculated as K c = ET c ∕ ET ref , can
    vary with climate. Literature review also revealed that the information is lacking
    on the magnitude of variation in K r values with the climate and the change in
    K r with the season within the same climatic conditions. One procedure for estimating
    K r values as a function of some of the climate variables was proposed by Allen
    et al. (1998) as Eq. (68) in FAO56 Irrigation and Drainage Paper K r = ET r ∕
    ET o = C + [ 0.04 ( U 2 − 2 ) − 0.004 ( RH min − 45 ) ] ( h ∕ 3 ) 0.3 (1) where
    C = coefficient that represents the K c value during the mid development period
    for alfalfa, and suggested as 1.05 for humid and calm conditions, 1.20 for semiarid
    and moderately windy conditions, and 1.35 for arid and windy conditions (Allen
    et al. 1998). The U 2 = average wind speed at 2 m height ( m s − 1 ) , RH min
    = minimum daily relative humidity during the midseason growth stage (%), and h
    = standard height for the alfalfa-reference surface ( 0.5 m ) . Eq. (1) adjusts
    K r when RH min and U 2 differ from 45% and 2 m s − 1 . Wright et al. (2000) evaluated
    K r values obtained using Eq. (1) using lysimeter ET r and ET o measurements at
    Bushland, Tex. and Kimberly, Ida. They stated that obtaining K r values from ET
    r and ET o estimated from combination-based equations may be preferable to using
    Eq. (1). The K r values from Eq. (1) were approximately 3–8% greater than values
    derived from lysimeter measurements, greater than values obtained with the Kimberly–Penman
    (Wright 1982) method, and lower than values estimated with the ASCE-PM method.
    Although the ideal and most accurate approach would be to derive K r values from
    local simultaneous lysimeter measurements of ET r and ET o , local lysimeter data
    are extremely rare, and simultaneous measurements for the two reference crops
    rarely exist. Aforementioned studies show that the technical information on the
    dynamics of the K r values in different climatic conditions is lacking. Unanswered
    questions of interest include the evaluation of temporal and spatial variability
    of K r values, quantification of differences among K r values obtained with different
    ET ref methods, and transferability of K r values among climatic regions. The
    objectives of this study were to: (1) develop ET r to ET o ratios ( K r values)
    for different climatic regions for the growing season and nongrowing (dormant)
    seasons; and (2) determine the variability (relative behavior) and seasonal trend
    of K r values within and between the locations to asses whether the K r values
    developed for one region can be used in other locations. Methods Study Sites Daily
    ET r and ET o for several locations with different climatic characteristics were
    calculated using carefully screened daily weather data. Locations included a semiarid
    and windy location (Bushland, Tex.), a transition location between subhumid and
    semiarid with strong winds (Clay Center, Neb.), a location with a Mediterranean
    climate (Davis, Calif), a humid inland location with strong maritime and oceanic
    weather influences from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean (Gainesville, Fla.),
    an arid-temperate location (Phoenix, Ariz.), and an inland humid location (Rockport,
    Mo). Latitude, longitude, elevation, years studied, and representative reference
    crop for each site are given in Table 1. Although few in number, these locations
    represented the diversity of climates needed to address the objectives of the
    study. Table 1. Coordinates, Elevation, and Years Studied for Each Location (from

    1978–1990, 1994–2000 Grass Weather Data Sets Daily weather data sets for Bushland
    were measured by the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory
    at the ET research facility at Bushland, Tex. Clay Center datasets were measured
    by the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC 2006) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
    South Central Agricultural Laboratory, located approximately 150 km west of Lincoln,
    near Clay Center, Neb. The ET r values for Clay Center were obtained directly
    from the HPRCC. Datasets at Rockport were also obtained from the HPRCC. Datasets
    for Davis were obtained from the California Department of Water Resources, California
    Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS 2006) website (Snyder and Pruitt
    1985, 1992). Climate data for Gainesville were measured at the Green Acres Agricultural
    Research and Extension Center weather station located approximately 8 km north
    of Gainesville in north central Florida (Irmak et al. 2003). Datasets at Phoenix
    were obtained from the Arizona Meteorological Network, (AZMET 2006). Daily weather
    variables recorded at the stations included maximum and minimum air temperature
    ( T max and T min ), maximum and minimum relative humidity ( RH max and RH min
    ), wind speed and direction, precipitation, and solar radiation ( R s ) . The
    type of instrumentation and placement heights for each site are listed in Table
    2. Although the same types and model of instrumentation may not have been used
    for the entire study periods for each location and may have changed over the years,
    the instrumentation type, model, and placement height that are listed in Table
    2 represent the most recently used instrumentation and placement for a given station.
    Long-term average values of some of the weather variables for each study location

    of Daily ET o and ET r Values The accuracy of the computed ET ref can be impacted
    substantially by the quality of the weather data used (Allen 1996; Itenfisu et
    al. 2003). Data quality checks have been recommended and procedures for the quality
    assessment of the datasets used to compute ET ref have been given by Allen (1996),
    Allen et al. (1998), ASCE-EWRI (2005), Droogers and Allen (2002), and Temesgen
    et al. (1999). In this study, quality and integrity checks were made for T max
    , T min , RH max , RH min , and R s for all datasets. Data quality analyses were
    not conducted for wind speed. Three years of data (1991–1993) from the Gainesville
    station were judged to be in poor quality and were excluded from the analyses
    and all other datasets used in this study were judged to be of good quality. Daily
    ET o and ET r values were calculated using the “standardized” ASCE-PM equation
    following the procedures outlined by ASCE-EWRI (2005). The standardized ASCE-PM
    equation was intended to simplify and clarify the application of the method and
    associated equations for computing aerodynamic ( r a ) and bulk surface resistance
    (stomatal resistance) ( r s ) (Irmak et al. 2005). Equations for two different
    reference surfaces were combined into a single expression with different coefficients
    for grass and alfalfa-reference, and for daily or hourly time steps (Itenfisu
    et al. 2003; Walter et al. 2001). The “standardized” ASCE-PM equation for both
    reference surfaces is ET ref = 0.408 Δ ( R n − G ) + γ C n T + 273 U 2 ( e s −
    e a ) [ Δ + γ ( 1 + C d U 2 ) ] (2) where ET ref = standardized reference ET (
    mm day − 1 ) ; Δ = slope of saturation vapor pressure versus air temperature curve
    ( kPa ° C − 1 ) ; R n = calculated net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m − 2
    day − 1 ); G = heat flux density at the soil surface (zero for daily time step);
    T = mean daily air temperature at 1.5 – 2.5 m height ( ° C ) ; U 2 = mean daily
    wind speed at 2 m height ( m s − 1 ) ; e s = saturation vapor pressure (kPa);
    e a = actual vapor pressure (kPa); γ = psychrometric constant ( kPa ° C − 1 )
    ; C n and C d , respectively, =numerator and denominator constants that change
    with reference surface and calculation time step; and 0.408 = coefficient ( m
    2 mm MJ − 1 ) . Wind speed measurements that were made other than at the 2 m height
    were converted to 2 m wind speed values using Eq. (47) in Allen et al. (1998)
    and all other parameters/variables in Eq. (2) were computed using the procedures
    given in ASCE-EWRI (2005). The values of C n and C d for the grass and alfalfa-reference
    surfaces and for daily time steps are given in Table 4. The C n values account
    for the time step and aerodynamic resistance of the reference surface and C d
    accounts for the time step, bulk surface resistance, and aerodynamic resistance
    of the reference surface (ASCE-EWRI 2005). Table 4. Values for C n and C d in

    0.34 1,600 0.38 In addition to the ASCE-PM ET r and ET o values, daily ET r values
    were computed with four other ET r methods that are described in Burman and Pochop
    (1994) and Jensen et al. (1990). Therefore, a detailed description of each method
    is not given and the reader is referred to original sources. For the ET r equations
    other than ASCE-PM, the procedures on calculation of the equation parameters associated
    with each equation were used. The methods were: (1) Jensen–Haise (Jensen and Haise
    1963); (2) 1972 Kimberly–Penman (Wright and Jensen 1972); (3) 1982 Kimberly–Penman
    (Wright 1982); and (4) the HPRCC-Penman equation. These models were selected because
    they represent the majority of the alfalfa-reference ET equations that are currently
    being used in different applications. In this study, the HPRCC-Penman equation
    was used only at Clay Center. The HPRCC equation is a Penman-type (Penman 1948)
    combination equation and was modified for Nebraska (Mitchell, Neb.) climatic conditions
    by Kincaid and Heerman (1974) and has been adopted by the HPRCC and has been widely
    used in North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, and Colorado as part of
    the HPRCC automated weather network. The standardized ASCE-PM method was used
    as the basis for comparisons with all the other methods. First, daily ET r values
    were compared with the standardized ASCE-PM ET r values. Discrepancies in ET r
    values obtained with different methods compared with the ASCE-PM method were quantified
    using the root- mean-square difference (RMSD). The four ET ref methods were also
    compared to the ASCE-PM method by linear regression analysis from which the coefficient
    of determination ( r 2 ) , slope, and intercept were calculated. A statistical
    analysis of equality of the regression line (slope) to unity was conducted to
    identify whether the ET r ( method ) values were significantly different than
    the ASCE-PM ET r values at the 95% confidence level. Analyses were conducted for
    both the calendar year and the growing season. Although the growing season varies
    with location, for consistency, it was considered to be from May 1 to September
    30 for all locations. Calculating K r Values Daily K r values were calculated
    from measured climate datasets. Monthly average K r values that were obtained
    from averaging daily K r values for each month were calculated using two different
    approaches. First, Eq. (1) was used to calculate K r values on a daily basis for
    each study site. Coefficient C was taken as 1.25, 1.23, 1.20, 1.05, 1.35, and
    1.05 for Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, Gainesville, Phoenix, and Rockport. Daily
    RH min and U 2 values were used in the calculations. Daily K r values were calculated
    for calendar year and growing season. To determine year-to-year variability and
    to quantify the measure of how widely the values were dispersed from the average
    K r values, the standard deviation (SD) between long-term and individual years’
    SD values were calculated. The following second approach was used to calculate
    the ratio of ET r over ET o to determine K r K r = ET r ( method ) ∕ ( ASCE -
    PM ET o ) (3) One of the differences between Eqs. (1) - (3) is that the FAO56
    K r procedure computes K r values as a function of RH min , U 2 , and a local
    coefficient ( C ) , and does not account for the evapotranspiration differences
    between two reference surfaces (alfalfa and grass). However, Eq. (3) computes
    K r values as a direct function of ET ref and accounts for the relative ratio
    of the two different surfaces (alfalfa and grass) under the same climatic environment
    simultaneously. In the second approach, the following equations were used to calculate
    K r values for each ET r method on a daily basis: ASCE-PM: K r = ET r ( ASCE -
    PM ) ET o ( ASCE - PM ) (4) 1963 Jensen–Haise (1963J-H): K r = ET r ( 1963 J -
    H ) ET o ( ASCE - PM ) (5) HPRCC: K r = ET r ( HPRCC ) ET o ( ASCE - PM ) (6)
    1972 Kimberly–Penman (1972 Kim-Pen): K r = ET r ( 1972 Kim - Pen ) ET o ( ASCE
    - PM ) (7) 1982 Kimberly–Penman (1982 Kim-Pen): K r = ET r ( 1982 Kim - Pen )
    ET o ( ASCE - PM ) (8) Results and Discussion Comparison of ET r ( method ) and
    ET r ( ASCE - PM ) Values It is important to asses the relative behavior of each
    ET r method as compared to the ASCE-PM ET r values before computing K r values
    because the robustness of the K r values calculated from different ET r methods,
    in part, will be a function of how well their ET r estimates compare with the
    ASCE-PM ET r values. The performance indicators and statistical analyses of comparisons
    of ET r values from each method with the ASCE-PM ET r values are given in Table
    5. The regression parameters for the calendar year and growing season for each
    method and location are included in Table 5. Table 5. Root-Mean-Square Difference

    for the growing season. For a given location, all days from May through September
    in each year were included in the analyses. C.Y. = Calendar year, G.S. = Growing
    season (May–September). d The slope of the regression line between the ET r (
    method ) values and the ASCE-PM ET r values is significantly different ( P < 0.05
    ) than the unity at the 5% significance level. The t values were reported only
    for calendar year analyses. The significance of the regression line was reported
    for the growing season analyses. 1963 Jensen-Haise ET r The 1963 J-H ET r estimates
    were poor compared with the ASCE-PM ET r values. The method underestimated at
    Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, and Rockport (Table 5) and overestimated at Gainesville
    and Phoenix. The method provided reasonable estimates only at Phoenix [ r 2 =
    0.90 , RMSD = 1.11 mm day − 1 for calendar year, (C.Y.)] and Gainesville ( r 2
    = 0.72 , RMSD = 1.17 mm day − 1 for C.Y.). The reasonable estimates at Phoenix
    and Gainesville might be due to the low wind speeds at these locations. This method
    does not account for wind speed, which may significantly affect the ET rate in
    some climates. In climates with strong winds, the saturated air above the plant
    canopy will be constantly replaced with drier air, increasing vapor pressure deficit
    and ET. However, in calm wind conditions, the saturated air in the immediate surrounding
    of the crop canopy may not be replaced as often, making ET less sensitive to wind
    speed. In climates with high humidity and low winds, the saturated air above the
    canopy can be replaced with only slightly less humid air. Thus, one would expect
    the 1963 J-H equation to provide better estimates of ET r in environments with
    calm winds compared with environments with strong winds. The 1963 J-H ET r estimates
    were significantly different than the ASCE-PM ET r values at all locations. The
    magnitude of underestimations at Bushland, Clay Center, and Davis increased at
    high ET values ( ⩾ 10 mm ) . The method overestimated the ASCE-PM ET r values
    by 8 and 17% at Phoenix and Gainesville (Table 5). The underestimation was 24%
    at Clay Center, which was in agreement with the value observed by Jensen et al.
    (1990) as 30% underestimations by this method at an arid and windy location (Scottsbluff,
    Neb.). Estimations for the growing season resulted in lower RMSD values at Clay
    Center and Rockport. HPRCC Penman ET r The HPRCC Penman ET r values were used
    and analyzed only at Clay Center. The method provided good estimates with a high
    r 2 value of 0.97 and low RMSD of 0.56 mm day − 1 . Estimates were parallel to
    the ASCE-PM ET r values for the majority of the data range. However, the equation
    did not respond to the changes in ET r values greater than approximately 10 mm
    and the magnitudes of underestimations were larger at the higher ET r rates. Overall,
    estimations were within 6% of the ASCE-PM ET r values. The RMSD value ( 0.63 mm
    day − 1 ) for the growing season was higher than for the calendar year ( 0.56
    mm day − 1 ) with similar slopes (0.94 versus 0.93). The consistent lagging of
    the HPRCC ET r values below the ASCE-PM ET r values at high ET values indicates
    calibration characteristics. The HPRCC Penman equation was modified by Kincaid
    and Heermann (1974) for Mitchell, Neb, climatic conditions by changing the wind
    function of the original Penman (1948) method. Kincaid and Heermann (1974) stated
    that the coefficients used in the wind function of the HPRCC Penman equation were
    nearly the same as those reported by Jensen (1969) for Twin Falls, Id. However,
    in practical application, the HPRCC ET r differs from the original equation of
    Kincaid and Heerman (1974). In practical application of the original equation
    by the HPRCC, the maximum value of wind speed and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)
    [ e s - e a in Eq. (2)] that can occur is limited to certain values. Thus, the
    equation does not respond to the effect of the wind speed and VPD on ET r after
    an approximately ET r value of ⩾ 10 mm . The ET r calculations reported by HPRCC
    in the daily weather data sets are made using a VPD limit of 2.3 kPa and wind
    speed limit of 5.1 m s − 1 as suggested by Hubbard (1992). These two conditions
    are the main cause of discrepancies between the HPRCC and the ASCE-PM ET r values
    at high ET r rates ( ⩾ 10 mm ) . These two conditions will cause some faulty ET
    r values by the HPRCC Penman. Because the climatic conditions of the VPD above
    2.3 kPa and wind speeds above 5.1 m s − 1 are often observed in many parts of
    Nebraska, especially during the growing season, the VPD and wind speeds above
    these limits can be a substantial portion of the climate datasets in some parts
    of the state during hot, dry, and windy periods. These large VPDs and high wind
    speeds represent natural climatic demand for evaporative losses of the environment
    and should be reflected in the ET r estimates. Eliminating the conditions on upper
    limits of the VPD and wind speed would greatly improve the performance of the
    HPRCC Penman equation at high ET rates as compared with the ASCE-PM ET r . 1972
    and 1982 Kimberly–Penman ET r The 1972 Kim-Pen had the best agreement with the
    ASCE-PM at all locations. The ET r estimates correlated very well with the ASCE-PM
    ET r values throughout the year, with low RMSD values of 0.87, 0.48, 0.41, 0.24,
    0.29, and 0.36 mm day − 1 for Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, Gainesville, Phoenix,
    and Rockport. The RMSD value of 0.48 mm day − 1 for Clay Center was smaller than
    the RMSD value obtained from the HPRCC Penman equation ( 0.56 mm day − 1 ) , which
    was originally calibrated for Nebraska conditions. The 1972 Kim-Pen ET r estimates
    were not significantly different from the ASCE-PM ET r values at two locations;
    Davis and Phoenix. This was the only method that had nonsignificant ( P > 0.05
    ) ET r estimates as compared with the ASCE-PM estimates among all methods for
    the calendar year. It also had the highest r 2 values ( ⩾ 0.97 ) among all locations.
    Overall, its estimates were within 3% of the ASCE-PM estimates with the exception
    of Phoenix where the estimates were 6% lower than the ASCE-PM. Growing season
    estimates were very similar to those obtained for the calendar year, but the magnitude
    of the underestimations during the growing season increased from 3 to 8% at Davis
    and from 6 to 14% at Phoenix. Although the 1972 Kim-Pen method slightly over-
    or underestimated the ASCE-PM ET r values, depending on location, it produced
    consistent estimates with less point scattering around the 1:1 line at both low
    and high ET r rates throughout the year at all locations. The 1982 Kim-Pen ET
    r estimates agreed well with ASCE-PM ET r values. The RMSD values were, however,
    higher than for the 1972 Kim-Pen at all locations, ranging from 0.54 mm day −
    1 at Gainesville to 1.08 mm day − 1 at Bushland. Underestimations were within
    3% of the ASCE-PM estimates at Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, and Rockport. The
    poorest estimates were at Gainesville and Phoenix, the two locations with the
    lowest wind speeds. The equation overestimated by 7 and 12% at Gainesville and
    Phoenix. The ET r estimates during the growing season were considerably better
    than those in nongrowing seasons, especially at Bushland, Clay Center, Davis,
    and Rockport. The estimates during the growing season were not significantly different
    from the ASCE-PM estimates at Bushland and Davis (Table 5). Irmak et al. (2003)
    reported that the 1982 Kim-Pen was originally developed for the period of April
    through October with a polynomial wind function. The original wind function did
    not behave correctly during November through March and later was changed to the
    "normal equation" wind function (J. L. Wright, personal communication) as given
    by Jensen et al. (1990), which was the wind function used in this study. This
    wind function decreases to a base level for the winter months and accounts for
    the shorter daylength. Daily K r Values for Calendar Year and Growing Season ASCE-PM
    K r Although the ASCE-PM K r values showed some variation between the locations
    they were more consistent than other K r values (Fig. 1). Values determined with
    the ASCE-PM consistently exhibited an increasing trend from summer towards the
    winter months at all locations with maximum values in December and January. Although
    they differed in magnitude, the annual trend of K r values was similar for all
    locations. The K r values had less variation during the growing season (May–September)
    than the nongrowing (dormant) season. The largest day-to-day fluctuation during
    the growing season was observed at Rockport, followed by Clay Center and Gainesville.
    The largest K r values were observed at Bushland and Clay Center, two locations
    where hot, dry, and windy conditions cause high ET rates during the growing season.
    The large K r values ⩾ 1.38 during the summer months may reflect the advective,
    dry, and high wind environment typical of Bushland. These conditions are also
    often observed at Clay Center, especially during late July and early August where
    ET r can exceed available energy ( R n ) reflecting advective conditions. The
    K r values ranged from 1.38 in July and August to a maximum of 1.55 and 1.56 in
    January and December, with calendar year and growing season averages of 1.46 and
    1.40 (Table 6). The lowest K r values were in Gainesville, ranging from 1.11 in
    July to 1.30 in January. The K r values were always greater than 1.11 during the
    calendar year and growing season at all locations and the day-to-day variation
    of K r values was very small during the year. The average SD values among years
    were always less than 0.10 for the calendar year and less than 0.08 for the growing
    season. These results agree with those reported by Jensen et al. (1990) who observed
    K r values ranging from a low of 1.03 for calm, humid conditions to a high of
    1.45 for extremely windy and dry conditions. However, the ASCE-PM K r values obtained
    in this study are somewhat higher than other K r values reported in the literature
    and are close to some of the K r values that are reported by other researchers.
    For example, in a lysimeter-measured alfalfa and grass ET study, Evett et al.
    (2000) reported that ET r was 1.15 times higher than ET o at Bushland, Tex., for
    the growing season. Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) suggested a K r value of 1.15
    for a dry climate with light to moderate wind. Erpenbeck (1981) obtained an average
    K r value of 1.21 using grass ET and pan evaporation data at Davis, Calif. Wright
    (1996) reported a seasonal K r value of 1.20 for Kimberly, Id. Fig. 1. (Color)

    for each year and averaged for long term. Each K r and SD value represents an

    Phoenix, and Rockport. C.Y. = calendar year, G.S. = growing season (May–September).
    It should be noted that the less variability in K r values does not necessarily
    mean higher accuracy and the term “variability” may also reflect the relative
    behavior of the methods when calculating the K r values. At first glance, the
    K r values developed using the ASCE-PM ET r and ET o values [Eq. (4)] might seem
    biased because two standardized forms of the Penman–Monteith equation were used
    to develop the K r values. However, these two equations represent two different
    reference surfaces and differ in respect to calibration parameters. Also, to somewhat
    minimize or normalize the “potential” biasness of the ASCE-PM K r method, the
    ASCE-PM ET o was specifically used as the common denominator for all methods when
    calculating K r . One may argue that the relative behavior of the ASCE-PM ET ref
    model for alfalfa and grass is less affected by climate variability than the relative
    behavior of two different models as used in the K r values in Eqs. (5) - (8).
    The relative behavior of the two differing ET models in the numerator as compared
    to the denominator of Eqs. (5) - (8) may be more pronounced as climate changes.
    It is not only the ASCE-PM method [Eq. (2)] that has the alfalfa surface in the
    numerator and grass surface in the denominator, but all Eqs. (4) - (8) have the
    alfalfa surface in the numerator and grass surface in the denominator. Although
    the values of the present K r analyses may show variation when the same reference
    ET model is used for alfalfa and grass [as in the case of Eq. (4)] versus when
    the same ET o but different ET r methods [in the case of Eqs. (5) - (8)] are used
    the effect of the relative behavior of the reference ET model on K r may be reduced.
    These two approaches also measures the robustness of the five different ET r methods
    for estimating ET r in different climates. Thus, in Eqs. (4) - (8), the consistency
    (less variability) of K r values will be somewhat a function of how consistently
    the ET r values were estimated by the ASCE-PM, 1972 and 1982 K-P, HPRCC Penman,
    and 1963 J-H equations. Also, rather than it’s potential biasness, a contrasting
    interpretation of the ASCE-PM method for determining K r values [Eq. (4)] is to
    acknowledge the advantage or the robustness of the method for developing the K
    r values. The ASCE-PM method has an advantage over other single ET r equations
    that both ET r and ET o parameters (aerodynamic resistance and bulk surface resistance)
    were combined into a single equation having different calibration parameters and
    time step coefficients. Thus, the ASCE-PM K r method might provide a more conclusive
    indication and/or information on the interpretation of the true variability in
    K r values between the locations and between the seasons for the same location,
    and transferability of the K r values from one location to another. FAO56 K r
    The K r values obtained with the FAO56 method [Eq. (1)] fluctuated in a substantially
    narrower range throughout the calendar year and growing season than any other
    method with nonconsistent values among locations (Fig. 1). For example, Bushland,
    Davis, and Phoenix had maximum K r values during the growing season and the values
    steadily decreased towards the winter months. However, at Clay Center, Gainesville,
    and Rockport, a considerably different trend was observed, with the largest values
    during spring and fall, and minimum values during the growing season. This might
    be due to differences in the seasonal trends of RH min and U 2 at different locations.
    Unlike the ASCE-PM, the FAO56 procedure had the largest K r values at Phoenix,
    followed by Bushland. The values ranged from 1.36 and 1.37 in December and January
    to 1.42 in May and June. The K r values were smaller at humid locations as compared
    with the arid and semiarid locations. The smallest K r values were obtained at
    Gainesville. Some of the K r values produced by the FAO-56 method seem unusual
    and possibly unrealistic. For reasons stated earlier related to alfalfa and grass
    reference surfaces, one would expect ET r > ET o for any climate. However, the
    K r values obtained with this method averaged 1.01 for the calendar year and 0.99
    for the growing season, indicating that ET r < ET o , which seems unusual. At
    Rockport, K r values also seem low, averaging 1.05 for the calendar year, and
    1.04 for the growing season. The inconsistent K r values among locations obtained
    with this method might be due to the magnitude of the weather variables ( RH min
    and U 2 ) used to develop and calibrate Eq. (1). In this equation, the base values
    of 45% and 2 m s − 1 for RH min and U 2 , respectively, seem too large and may
    not work for climatic conditions that differ significantly from those for which
    the equation was developed. To further test this hypothesis, daily RH min and
    U 2 values for each study site were graphed in Figs. 2 and 3 to assess the long-term
    magnitude and trend and possible effects of the base values of RH min and U 2
    on the performance of the FAO56 K r procedure in different climates. Usually,
    at Bushland and Davis RH min is less than 45%, especially during the growing season
    (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 indicates that U 2 at Bushland is rarely below 2 m s − 1 , whereas
    at Gainesville and Phoenix it rarely exceeds 2 m s − 1 . At Rockport and Davis,
    U 2 is less than 2 m s − 1 approximately 40% of the time. At Phoenix, RH min is
    less than 45% about 90% of the time. Therefore, for most of the time at this location
    the RH min − 45 and U 2 − 2 terms in Eq. (1) would be either zero or negative
    and K r would only be a function of the coefficient C . Coefficient C alone cannot
    provide accurate or realistic K r values. These findings suggest that the local
    calibration of Eq. (1) for RH min and U 2 for local climate will enhance its capability
    to provide more realistic and consistent K r values as compared to the ASCE-PM
    K r values. Fig. 2. (Color) Long-term daily RH min values at each study site.

    forms of Penman equations showed opposite trends. The 1972 Kim-Pen equation resulted
    in the largest K r values during the dormant (winter) season, and decreased gradually
    towards the growing season (Fig. 1). The 1982 Kim-Pen produced the largest K r
    values during the growing season and decreased gradually towards winter. The opposite
    trend in K r values between the two equations might be due to a combination of
    differences in the wind functions used and the performance in estimating ET r
    relative to the ASCE-PM ET r . Both Kim-Pen equations always resulted in K r >
    1.0 with the lowest values obtained at the most humid location, Gainesville. The
    growing season average K r values were similar for both methods. The 1972 Kim-Pen
    method resulted in the closest K r values compared with the ASCE-PM method at
    all locations. The 1972 Kim-Pen values were lowest during the growing season at
    Gainesville, and unlike other locations, this is the time of the year when the
    highest RH occurs. Jensen et al. (1990) stated that as humidity increases the
    K r values should decrease. The 1972 Kim-Pen K r values were largest at Bushland
    followed by Clay Center, and were similar to the ASCE-PM values. The average values
    were as high as 1.79 and 1.78 in December and January at Bushland and 1.80 in
    the same months at Clay Center. In general, the 1972 Kim-Pen values had larger
    day-to-day fluctuations than other methods at all locations, especially during
    the dormant season, with less variation during the middle of the growing season.
    1963 J-H and HPRCC K r The 1963 J-H K r values were calculated only for Phoenix
    due to the very poor ET r estimates at other locations (Table 5). The K r values
    were lowest during the nongrowing season with highest values observed from May
    through early October. The values were less than 1.0 during the winter months.
    Very low ratios ( < 1.0 ) are due to a combination of low estimates of ET r by
    this method, and potentially high estimates of ET o by the ASCE-PM method during
    the nongrowing season. The calendar year and growing season monthly average values
    were 1.22 and 1.35 with year-to-year variation of 0.19 and 0.12 (Table 6). The
    HPRCC Penman K r values were developed only for Clay Center. The K r values had
    similar magnitudes and followed trends similar to the ASCE-PM values from mid
    January through late September, but deviated substantially from October through
    January (Fig. 1). This deviation was due to underestimation of ET r by this method
    as compared with the ASCE-PM ET o estimates during the dormant season. The K r
    values were 6–7% lower than the ASCE-PM K r values from June through September.
    Values ranged from 1.20 in July and August to 1.50 in January, averaging 1.33
    and 1.25 for the calendar year and growing season, respectively. The K r values
    had the same year-to-year variations (0.19 and 0.12 for the same periods) as the
    1963 J-H method. The aforementioned finding indicated that the K r values presented
    considerable variability among locations and between the seasons within the same
    location with the ASCE-PM K r values exhibiting the least variability. In general,
    the variability during the growing season was less than during the calendar year
    for most of the methods. However, for both periods, there was more than 25% variability
    in K r values among locations to justify the need for developing K r values for
    specific climates. For example, the calendar year average values for the ASCE-PM
    were 1.46, 1.43, 1.37, 1.21, 1.33, and 1.36 for Bushland, Clay Center, Davis,
    Gainesville, Phoenix, and Rockport. While the values were similar for Bushland
    and Clay Center, they were about 7, 17, 8, and 6% higher than the values for Davis,
    Gainesville, Phoenix, and Rockport. Using one K r value developed for a local
    climate using one method in other climates could result up to a 20–25% difference
    in estimating ET and K c . The FAO56 procedure resulted in the highest variability
    among locations for all methods. The K r values for Gainesville and Rockport calculated
    using the FAO56 procedure were 25 and 22% lower than those for Bushland for the
    calendar year, and 26 and 22% lower for the growing season. Nongrowing (Dormant)
    Season ET ref and K r Although, in many cases, the emphasis is on the growing
    season ET and K r values, the dormant season K r and ET ref values are of interest
    because they can be useful tools to asses the dormant season evaporative demand
    of the atmosphere. As shown earlier, some of the methods produced some “potentially
    unrealistically” high (e.g., 1.78, 1.80) K r values during the dormant periods.
    This is, in part, due to the unrealistic ET ref estimations of the methods, including
    ASCE-PM ET r and ET o estimates. Allen et al. (1998) defined the dormant season
    as periods during which no agricultural crop has been planted. In temperate regions,
    the dormant season may include periods of frost and continuously frozen conditions.
    Obviously the length of the dormant season varies among locations and it may be
    only 1 month or two at Gainesville or as long as 6 – 7 months at other locations.
    The possible unrealistic estimates of the combination-based ET ref equations have
    been acknowledged in the past. ASCE-EWRI (2005) stated that the ET from nonactive
    vegetation during dormant periods is generally less than ET ref because of the
    substantially increased surface resistance ( r s ) . While it is recognized that
    the ET ref equations do not completely represent measurable quantities of evaporative
    demand of the air during dormant periods, the standardized ASCE-PM equation can
    still be useful as an evaporative index. The possible reasons for unrealistic
    ET ref estimates by the combination methods can be a function of a combination
    of factors. In addition to the increased bulk surface resistance, r s , Jensen
    (2006, personal communication) suggested that the following conditions contribute
    to unrealistic ET ref estimates during dormant periods: (1) the change in the
    amount of daytime hours to nighttime hours; (2) the greater emphasis of the aerodynamic
    component of the combination equation relative to the radiation component during
    periods with lower temperatures; and (3) unrealistic values of r s at low temperatures.
    To address the greater effect of the aerodynamic component relative to the radiation
    component during periods with lower temperatures, use of sum-of-hourly calculations
    may reduce the effect somewhat. The impacts of using 24 h average weather data
    to predict ET that occurs mainly over approximately an 8 h period also introduces
    errors during winter. Irmak et al. (2005) suggested that there is a benefit and
    potential improvement in accuracy when the standardized ASCE-PM procedure is applied
    hourly instead of daily for ET ref estimates, especially during the dormant seasons.
    The hourly application helps to account for impacts of abrupt changes in atmospheric
    conditions on ET ref estimation. Jensen (2006, personal communication) further
    stated that the unrealistic values of r s at low temperatures could affect ET
    r more than ET o . Perhaps a rational approach for ET r would be to arbitrarily
    increase the r s when temperatures fall below values that can sustain or mimic
    actively growing vegetation. This could be based on alfalfa growth characteristics
    if the r s data are available during dormant periods. Also, one could assume that
    the vegetation height (effective roughness) decreases either suddenly or gradually
    to some low base value such as 0.05 m as cold temperatures occur. The r s would
    be decreased following rains that cause wet surface conditions. Furthermore, the
    calculation of R n during the growing season assumes an albedo ( α ) value of
    0.23 for a green vegetation surface, which is not realistic during dormant periods.
    Experimental knowledge and adequate procedures to estimate soil heat flux (especially
    for hourly calculations) during freezing conditions are lacking. Thus, the “standardized”
    reference surface conditions now used in the “standardized” ASCE-PM equation are
    not met during dormant periods, resulting in potentially unrealistic estimates
    of K r values. The effect of the potentially unrealistically high estimates of
    K r values on ET ref estimates during the dormant period rather than growing season
    should be lower than one would expect due to low ET r and ET o values during the
    dormant periods. Nevertheless, information is lacking on the “true” performance
    of the ET ref estimates and “true” values of the K r as determined by the combination
    equations, including the ASCE-PM estimates during the dormant periods. The analyses
    and comparisons of the dormant period ET by combination methods against measured
    data and developing robust methodologies to quantify dormant season ET and K r
    are needed. Conclusions The K r coefficients that can enable conversions from
    ET r to ET o , or vice versa, were developed for six locations differing in climatic
    characteristics. The first approach of developing K r values was ASCE-PM ET r
    to ET o ratios, and the second was the equation proposed in FAO56 as a function
    of RH min , U 2 , and a coefficient. The variability in K r values among locations
    was large, suggesting the need to develop K r values for a local region. For example,
    the K r values developed with the ASCE-PM method in July were 1.38, 1.27, 1.32,
    1.11, 1.28, and 1.19, for Bushland, Clay Center, Davis, Gainesville, Phoenix,
    and Rockport, respectively. In general, the variation in growing season K r values
    was less than for the calendar year. The magnitude of variation among locations
    was less for the ASCE-PM K r values than for other methods at all locations. The
    variability among locations was larger for the FAO56 method, especially for areas
    with low relative humidity and high wind speeds. Our findings suggest that the
    local calibration of this approach for minimum relative humidity and wind speed
    for local climate will enhance its capability to provide more realistic and consistent
    K r values as compared to the ASCE-PM K r values. In general, year-to-year variability
    in K r for the same location was low. The differences also varied substantially
    among locations for a given method, with the difference being lower when the ASCE-PM
    K r values were used. Some of the methods produced high and “potentially” unrealistic
    K r values during the dormant periods. One can normally expect these very high
    K r values under conditions of very strong wind and very large VPD. However, the
    VPD during winter is not extremely large in some of the locations studied. Potentially
    unrealistic K r values might be due to inaccuracies in the ET ref calculations
    during winter months. Because simultaneous and direct measurements of the ET r
    and ET o values rarely exist, it appears that the approach of ET r to ET o ratios
    calculated with the ASCE-PM method is currently the best approach available to
    derive K r values for locations where these measurements are not available. The
    K r values developed in this study can be useful for making conversions from ET
    r to ET o , or vice versa, to enable using crop coefficients developed for one
    reference surface with the other to determine actual crop water use for locations,
    with similar climatic characteristics of this study, when locally measured K r
    values are not available. Acknowledgments A contribution of the University of

    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    \ into a wide range of modern\nIoT applications. The growing number of networked\
    \ IoT devices generates a large amount of data.\nHowever, processing and memorizing\
    \ this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed\ncritical challenges,\
    \ especially when using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit\n\
    valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged\
    \ as a way to bring\ncloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to\
    \ address computation-intensive ofﬂoading\nand latency issues. This paper provides\
    \ a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works\nrelated to UAV technology\
    \ applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details\n\
    the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications\
    \ and the role of\nboth deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting\
    \ various limitations related to latency,\ntask ofﬂoading, energy demand, and\
    \ security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains\nan insight\
    \ into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges\
    \ to be\ntackled when using AI.\nKeywords: UAVs; IoT; cloud computing; edge computing;\
    \ MEC; AI; review\n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is constantly\
    \ expanding to cover many ﬁelds\nand applications. IoT devices present many beneﬁts\
    \ for improving services in a broad\nrange of contexts. The number of connected\
    \ devices is forecasted to reach impressive\nheights in the coming years. According\
    \ to CISCO, more than 70 billion devices will be\nconnected by the end of 2025\
    \ [1,2]. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically\nknown as drones,\
    \ have attracted considerable attention from academia and industrial\ncommunities\
    \ due to their excellent capabilities and attractive features. They promise to\n\
    bring an ideal contribution to the ﬁeld of IoT, based on their unique characteristics.\
    \ They\noffer elastic and ﬂexible mobile features, as required in many omnipresent\
    \ IoT applications,\nmaking their integration into wireless network communication\
    \ easy and feasible.\nMoreover, integrating embedded intelligent devices such\
    \ as cameras and sensors on\nUAVs offer many advantages when monitoring hostile\
    \ and unreachable environments.\nIn addition, they can potentially provide many\
    \ services in the context of modern IoT\ninterconnection, such as smart cities,\
    \ smart farming, smart factories, smart grids, and\nintelligent transportation.\
    \ The development of communication protocols and networks\nhas also improved the\
    \ tracking and maneuverability of drones to cover many application\nrequirements,\
    \ as well as their contribution as a critical component of the communication\n\
    network [3]. UAVs can also guarantee reliable connectivity in hostile areas with\
    \ limited\nDrones 2021, 5, 148. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5040148\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n2 of 30\nor unavailable communication infrastructure. Typically,\
    \ UAVs can be deployed as aided\ncommunication networks by integrating them into\
    \ the peripheral network as ﬂying base\nstations (BSs) [4,5], relay nodes [6],\
    \ or terminal nodes [7]. Therefore, they act primarily as a\nmeans of enabling\
    \ ﬂexible communication services in remote areas when interconnections\nwith existing\
    \ networks are lost. To this end, UAVs can be used in edge-computing (EC),\nfog-computing\
    \ (FC), and as crucial equipment in cellular networks [8].\nIoT networks enable\
    \ comprehensive connectivity for many mobile users by enabling\nvarious emerged\
    \ application services (e.g., automatic surveillance, unmanned control\nvehicles\
    \ and object recognition). Centralized servers, such as cloud computing (CC)\n\
    facilities and data centers, generally process and analyze the generated data\
    \ by carrying out\ncomputational intelligence based on artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI). These centralized systems\nare quick to deploy, inexpensive to maintain,\
    \ and practical when data need to be centrally\ncontrolled. However, they are\
    \ mostly constrained by their high failure rate, security risks\nand access delay.\
    \ Data processing at the central level causes considerable time delays that\n\
    affect the overall system quality of service (QoS), especially regarding the response-time\n\
    requirement for latency-sensitive applications. Decentralized and distributed\
    \ systems have\nemerged to solve the issue of centralized system constraints.\
    \ The decentralized system relies\non servers that are supposed to store a copy\
    \ of the resources. Users in distributed systems\nhave equal access to data, yet\
    \ user rights can be enabled as necessary, and data ownership\ncan be shared efﬁciently.\
    \ Hardware and software resources are also allocated between\nusers, increasing\
    \ truthfulness, reducing component failure, and enhancing reliability.\nEC has\
    \ recently been introduced to provide intermediate devices between the data\n\
    generator and CC services. This reduces latency and provides efﬁcient bandwidth\
    \ uti-\nlization. However, due to their limited computing power and battery life,\
    \ mobile devices\nstruggle to provide these services. To this end, mobile edge\
    \ computing (MEC) solutions\nhave been employed to ameliorate the intensive computation\
    \ and ofﬂoading bottlenecks\nbetween end-nodes and centralized data servers [9].\
    \ They allow mobile devices to ofﬂoad\ntheir computation duties onto servers at\
    \ the edge of the IoT network, such as cellular BSs\nor access points. In contrast\
    \ to traditional CC, MEC servers can be close to end-users. As a\nresult, MEC\
    \ servers can deliver low latency and secure services, while saving energy for\n\
    mobile users.\nRecently, UAVs have been integrated as air–ground equipment to\
    \ fulﬁll the processing\nand storage needs at IoT network edges. As a promising\
    \ solution, they could provide ultra-\nlow latency support for latency-sensitive\
    \ applications, facilitate the distribution of big data\nprocessing and analysis,\
    \ improve the scalability and management of massive mobile con-\nnectivity, as\
    \ well as content caching and mobile delivery [10]. The advantage presented by\n\
    their ﬂexible mobility has facilitated the integration of UAVs with MEC services\
    \ to provide\nUAV-enabled MEC networks. UAV-enabled MEC is typically deployed\
    \ in unpredictable\nenvironments such as in wild, desert, and complex landscapes.\
    \ Furthermore, the computa-\ntion performance may be adapted based on the distance\
    \ that UAVs can smoothly control.\nThis combination of UAV technology with MEC\
    \ makes the system more advantageous\nand ﬂexible than traditional MEC systems,\
    \ which are constrained by high deployment\ncosts due to their ﬁxed architecture.\
    \ In addition, the integration of UAV-enabled MEC\nwith the most recent security\
    \ approaches, such as the blockchain structure, increases the\nsecurity level\
    \ [11]. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that gives a secure, immutable,\n\
    transparent, and trustworthy environment for the UAVs to store their data as a\
    \ transaction\nin a chain of blocks [12]. This is a viable solution to mitigate\
    \ the security and privacy issues\nrelated to UAV networks. Therefore, integrating\
    \ blockchain into UAVs ensures the MEC\nsystem’s trustworthiness with the additional,\
    \ advantageous features of automating data\ntransaction, decision-making, storage,\
    \ and veriﬁcation [13]. Therefore, UAVs can play a\ncrucial role in enabling MEC\
    \ capability in IoT applications. However, many critical issues\nhave yet to be\
    \ addressed to improve the performance of UAV-enabled MEC. Most of the\nimpairments\
    \ are related to drones as they are autonomous and battery-powered, with\nlimited\
    \ resources. Furthermore, given the broadcast nature of communications between\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n3 of 30\nground-based users and UAVs, many performance aspects\
    \ should be addressed, including\nsecurity, task ofﬂoading, energy consumption,\
    \ resource allocation, computing capacity, and\nuser latency performance under\
    \ various channel circumstances.\nSince this topic is revolutionary in the IoT\
    \ research ﬁeld, reviewing the current sci-\nentiﬁc achievements and technological\
    \ limitations of UAV-enabled MEC networks is of\nparamount importance. Furthermore,\
    \ the limits of existing surveys on UAV-enabled MEC\nin IoT applications have\
    \ motivated us to put forward a detailed review. This paper explores\nthe use\
    \ of UAVs in emerging IoT applications and the utility of both deep learning (DL)\n\
    and machine learning (ML) in UAV-enabled MEC systems. For instance, the authors\
    \ of [14]\nhave elaborated a review about the energy efﬁciency constraints related\
    \ to UAV-enabled\nMEC systems for IoT devices. Additionally, the authors of [15,16]\
    \ have presented a survey\nabout communication and networking technologies for\
    \ UAVs. The research work presented\nin [17] has addressed both fundamental and\
    \ recent advances of computation ofﬂoading\nin UAV-enabled MEC. However, only\
    \ a few of the challenges are mentioned in the above\nworks, including energy,\
    \ communication facilities, and limited resource allocation issues.\nIn this paper,\
    \ the most critical issues and challenges of UAV-enabled MEC based on AI are\n\
    accurately outlined and discussed.\nIndeed, there are several recent reviews about\
    \ the UAV-enabled MEC paradigm. How-\never, most of the previous reviews have\
    \ focused on UAV energy efﬁciency, communication\ntechnologies connecting various\
    \ UAVs, and computation ofﬂoading in UAV-enabled MEC.\nOur review considers a\
    \ more practical and recent scenario wherein massively generated\ndata need to\
    \ be processed and analyzed using AI algorithms for decision-making at the\nedge\
    \ of networks. This has not been considered in the previous works. Adopting AI\n\
    methods would affect all the requirements that have already been investigated,\
    \ such as\nenergy efﬁciency, communication technologies, processing capacity,\
    \ privacy and security,\nand the autonomy of UAV-enabled MEC. Almost all domains\
    \ are currently relying on AI\nto outperform the traditional systems and provide\
    \ decision-making systems. For instance,\nIndustry 4.0 has newly emerged as a\
    \ revolutionary paradigm in which intelligent and\nautonomous drones based on\
    \ AI would be the key element. However, the integration of\nautonomous UAVs based\
    \ on AI is not obvious in most practical cases. This is why UAV-\nenabled MEC\
    \ based on AI would enable many applications in the industry community to\ndeploy\
    \ their solutions, by cooperatively executing and processing the massive volumes\n\
    of conﬁdential data near the users at the edge of the network. Consequently, the\
    \ current\nreview highlights the most recent challenges and open issues of UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC based\non AI, considering their various architectures and applications.\
    \ We will discuss the most\nrecent related works on data processing at the edge,\
    \ based on AI, and their advantages and\ninconveniences regarding the UAV environment.\
    \ We will even emphasize the effect of AI\non energy efﬁciency, communication\
    \ technologies, processing capacity, and security when\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture\
    \ is considered. In addition, we propose a list of applications\nwith open issues\
    \ that have to be taken into account when considering a UAV-enabled MEC\narchitecture.\n\
    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of\
    \ UAVs and\nhighlights some of their related applications. Section 3 focuses on\
    \ the possible opportunities\nenabled by UAVs, focusing on MEC servers. Section\
    \ 4 highlights the UAV-enabled MEC\nbased on AI. Section 5 lists signiﬁcant issues\
    \ and open research directions related to UAV-\nenabled MEC systems. Finally,\
    \ Section 6 presents a conclusion.\n2. UAV System Model\nRecently, there has been\
    \ an increase in customer demand for airborne intelligence\nmissions, which has\
    \ led to the design and development of various types of UAVs in various\nshapes\
    \ and ﬂight modes. This section highlights the different styles and characteristics\
    \ of\nUAVs and their application scenarios.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n4 of 30\n2.1.\

    \ Generally, the selection of any UAV model should\nfulﬁll many of the criteria\

    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n6 of 30\n2.2. UAV-Enabled Services\nUAV technology’s appealing\
    \ ﬂexibility and mobility characteristics have drawn atten-\ntion in terms of\
    \ integration with other networks as a way to address various challenging\napplications.\
    \ UAVs can be a part of IoT networks, referred to as the Internet of Flying\n\
    Things (IoFT) [25]. The IoFT can improve the availability of IoT services in areas\
    \ with poor\ncommunication coverage and limited infrastructures. For instance,\
    \ UAVs can provide FC\nand EC services and cellular communications in rural or\
    \ developing regions and submarine\nenvironments. As a result, reaching hostile\
    \ and congested environments has become easier\nand faster, thus improving emergent\
    \ intervention wherever and whenever it is required.\nAs support to communication\
    \ networks, UAVs can be dispatched as peripheral nodes with\nvarious operating\
    \ units, such as ﬂying BSs, relay nodes, or end-node stations [7]. UAVs act\n\
    as relay/terminal nodes related to disconnected nodes, stabilizing communication\
    \ links\nin an ad hoc manner. A set of deployed UAVs can thereby form a ﬂying\
    \ ad hoc network\n(FANET), which is a subclass of the mobile ad hoc network (MANET)\
    \ [26].\nIn IoT networks, UAVs can potentially adopt many recent cellular and\
    \ non-cellular\nwireless communication networks to control the UAV on the one\
    \ hand, and to enhance\nthe coverage and latency services on the other. The most\
    \ prominent communication pro-\ntocols that can be used with UAVs are IEEE 802.11\
    \ (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMax), IEEE\n802.15.4 (LRWPAN), cellular networks (3G/4G),\
    \ IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), LoRaWAN\n(LoRa), SigFox and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ [27–31]. Typically, the choice of communica-\ntion protocol depends on the desired\
    \ achievable throughput, power consumption, range,\nimplementation cost, reliability,\
    \ delay, and security. Grouped according to application\nrequirements, the characteristics\
    \ of the most-used communication protocols are presented\nin [32]. As described\
    \ in Table 2, there are various available communication protocols that\ncan be\
    \ used in UAV-enabled MEC. Each protocol is given a list of advantages and disad-\n\
    vantages regarding data rate, coverage, deployment cost, energy consumption, latency,\n\
    spectrum availability, and the number of supported users. Thus, the use of communication\n\
    technology depends literally on the application requirements.\nAlong with high\
    \ mobility and scalability, UAVs can offer many potential opportu-\nnities in\
    \ terms of enabling services such as pervasive connectivity, aerial intelligence,\n\
    self-maintenance capabilities for communications, and sensor deployment. Therefore,\n\
    UAVs act as airborne BSs [33], data collectors, relay nodes [34], jammers [35],\
    \ monitors [36],\nedge- and cloud computing servers [37], and power suppliers\
    \ [38] to support IoT applica-\ntions. These will extend network coverage and\
    \ provide diversiﬁed and ﬂexible intelligence\nfacilities for new potentialities\
    \ in modern IoT applications. In summary, as illustrated\nin Figure 3, UAVs can\
    \ facilitate a wide range of solutions in IoT applications. They can\nprovide\
    \ intelligent communications by establishing wireless networks in inaccessible\
    \ and\nhazardous environments; they also enable parallel intelligent areal services,\
    \ such as CC,\nEC, and LC.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n7 of 30\nTable 2. Characteristics\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural fields to detect specific\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural ﬁelds to detect speciﬁc diseases\n\
    that threaten the quality of plants at an early stage. The implemented system\
    \ can predict\nfarm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing and AI\

    in [42–44]. In addition, UAVs play an exciting role in crop monitoring by facilitating\
    \ many\ntasks previously restricted to the laborer and farmer [45–47].\n•\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0:\nThe increasing demand for fast and low-cost productivity has encouraged\
    \ the indus-\ntrial and research communities to incorporate robotics into the\
    \ industrial process. UAVs\nhave recently attracted the attention of industrial\
    \ solution providers in response to the\nincreased need for productivity; for\
    \ instance, the authors proposed an industrial IoT-based\nsystem that collects\
    \ data by a UAV camera and sends it to a cloud server for process-\ning [48].\
    \ The design aims to monitor the industrial zone to prevent undesirable incidents\n\
    in the production process, relying on the robust intelligence of computer vision\
    \ (CV) ap-\nproaches [49,50]. The mining industry has also increased the level\
    \ of interest in drones for\n3D mapping, mine safety, and mine management [51].\n\
    •\nEnvironment:\nUAVs are being adopted as a means to monitor and survey various\
    \ environmental\nareas. They can be used for the monitoring and data aggregation\
    \ of archeological sites. For\nexample, the authors of [52] have reported that\
    \ UAVs can present accurate and precise\nimages of the studied archeological space,\
    \ compared to terrestrial measurements. UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n10 of 30\ntechnologies\
    \ can also be deployed in ecological monitoring systems to track wildlife in\n\
    heterogeneous territories and topographically challenging areas as a supporting\
    \ platform\nfor traditional techniques [53]. Besides, this technology may facilitate\
    \ geological researchers\nwhen collecting remote data about many species and animals\
    \ [54]. Moreover, the authors\nof [55] proposed an intelligent model based on\
    \ UAV, dedicated to monitoring several types\nof plants using the latest computer\
    \ vision algorithms and cloud computing technologies.\nUAVs are also used to track\
    \ wild animals over large areas [56].\n•\nHealth and emergency:\nDrones can offer\
    \ several beneﬁts for public health emergencies, for instance, tackling\nepidemics\
    \ and contagious diseases such as COVID-19. For instance, during the COVID-19\n\
    pandemic, some governments and countries adopted drones to survey the rapid spread\n\
    of the virus, diagnose patients, and then predict the mortality risk factor by\
    \ applying AI\napproaches to the collected data. The drones have been used to\
    \ observe crowds, broadcast\ncritical public announcements and information, spray\
    \ disinfectants, and carry out extensive\ntemperature measurements in several\
    \ residential areas [57]. Additionally, the lifeguard\ncommunity uses UAVs for\
    \ search and rescue missions requiring rapid intervention. Their\nversatility\
    \ also allows obtaining a quick overview of the rescue situation instead of using\n\
    human-crewed airplanes that may take extra time to deploy [58]. Relying on UAV-enabled\n\
    MEC, AI, and CV schemes could lead to new applications that simulate visual reality,\n\
    thus enabling faster and real-time decisions in emergency interventions. For instance,\n\
    UAVs typically detect obstacles by ﬂying over them, gathering data, extracting\
    \ the most\nprominent features, and making decisions based on machine vision and\
    \ pattern recognition\ntechnologies. In this manner, people with visual impairments\
    \ can maneuver comfortably.\nThis technology is expected to be a key solution\
    \ in the healthcare revolution [58].\n•\nSmart cities and smart homes:\nThe urban\
    \ environment is expected to acquire a massive number of dynamically\nconnected\
    \ devices due to diverse activities wherein UAVs as mobile vehicles will have\
    \ many\npivotal roles, including real-time trafﬁc control [59], transportation\
    \ [60], infrastructure\ncontrol and management [61], and buildings observation\
    \ [62]. Accordingly, UAVs are\nexpected to provide communication services to heterogeneous\
    \ smart devices in urban\nareas, to improve the smart city from application perspectives\
    \ [63]. For example, the\nauthors of [64] have proposed an architecture for 5G\
    \ hierarchical IoT networks where the\nUAVs play a fundamental role as a data\
    \ fusion center, formation controller, and network\ngateway. In another context,\
    \ UAVs were used to perform lightweight parts delivery to\nworkstation operators\
    \ within a manufacturing plant, where GPS could not provide a\npractical solution\
    \ for indoor positioning, in addition to intelligent shipping, intelligent\nmonitoring,\
    \ and intelligent control [65].\n•\nNatural disaster tracking:\nDuring natural\
    \ disasters, a rapid and effective response is required to assist the popu-\n\
    lation, avoid increasing the number of victims, and minimize the economic impact.\
    \ UAVs\ncan respond quickly to earthquake help requests, ﬁnd missing people, and\
    \ facilitate the\nmonitoring and rescue of victims in danger of drowning during\
    \ ﬂoods [66,67]. Collecting\na large amount of data from different sensors deployed\
    \ in the environment, using UAV-\nenabled MEC with AI algorithms, can help to\
    \ rapidly predict and intervene in natural\ndisasters such as tornadoes, volcanic\
    \ eruptions, tsunamis, and storms.\n•\nConstruction:\nUAV-enabled MEC and computer\
    \ vision techniques are promising solutions for the\ncondition assessment of civilian\
    \ and public infrastructures. UAVs are being used increas-\ningly in many construction\
    \ tasks, such as building inspections [68], building condition\nmonitoring, damage\
    \ assessments of buildings after disasters [69], public site surveying\nand mapping\
    \ [70], safety inspections of construction sites and workers, and monitoring\n\
    the progress of construction [71].\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n11 of 30\nTable 3. Comparative\

    13 of 30\n•\nWireless and cellular networks:\nMany efforts have been dedicated\
    \ to harnessing the full potential of UAV communi-\ncations for cellular and wireless\
    \ communications in the networks industry. The research\ncommunity explored the\
    \ opportunity of UAV-mounted utilization via ﬂying relays and BSs\nthat can dynamically\
    \ reposition themselves to boost network coverage, increase spectral\nefﬁciency,\
    \ and improve user QoS. The UAVs enable low-altitude supports beyond line-of-\n\
    sight (LOS) control and reliable communications [72]. Furthermore, UAVs can bring\
    \ many\nfacilities to cellular IoT-based networks by providing processing facilities\
    \ near the ground\nfor users.\n2.4. UAV-Enabled and -Assisted MEC Architecture\n\
    Centralized networks are easy to maintain because they have just one point of\
    \ failure.\nHowever, due to the instability of the system categories, this design\
    \ is insufﬁcient to\nrespond to ubiquitous applications. A single issue affecting\
    \ the core server might destroy\nthe entire system. Unlike centralized networks,\
    \ distributed networks are deemed more\nstable due to their decentralized architecture,\
    \ since the entirety of the information system\nis dispersed among a vast number\
    \ of nodes that maintain similar conditions. This feature\nimproves distributed\
    \ system security by making it challenging to target many users.\nFurthermore,\
    \ blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed ledger that provides a\nsecure,\
    \ immutable, transparent, and trustless environment due to its distributed architec-\n\
    ture. Integrating this approach with UAVs allows them to record their data in\
    \ the chain of\nblocks as a transaction, ensuring their trustworthiness [74].\
    \ The essential foundations of\nblockchain technology are intelligent contracts\
    \ and consensus mechanisms. This method\neliminates the requirement for a trusted\
    \ third-party system to protect data privacy since\nconsensus techniques maintain\
    \ data integrity. The use of cryptographic methods guaran-\ntees that data on\
    \ blockchains are secure. These exciting blockchain characteristics increase\n\
    the applicability of UAVs in a variety of civil and mission-critical applications\
    \ that use\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture. Moreover, distributed systems outperform\
    \ centralized\nsystems in terms of network speed, since the information is not\
    \ stored in a central lo-\ncation, and the number of users attempting to access\
    \ a server is more signiﬁcant than\nthe server can support, causing long waiting\
    \ times and slowing down the system for\ndecentralized architecture.\nMoving all\
    \ computing activities to the cloud has proven an effective mechanism to\nprocess\
    \ data since the cloud offers greater processing capacity than network edge devices.\n\
    However, data-processing speeds have risen rapidly due to the size of communicated\
    \ data\nand the networks’ bandwidth. Therefore, CC suffers from bottlenecks due\
    \ to the massive\nvolume of data generated in real time. Cameras in UAVs capture\
    \ a tremendous amount\nof video data, which the system should process in real-time\
    \ to enable good decision-\nmaking. Sending data from UAVs to the cloud server\
    \ would mostly result in longer\ndelays. Deploying a large number of IoT devices,\
    \ such as UAVs, would restrict bandwidth,\nreliability and security. Therefore,\
    \ processing data at the network edge would yield shorter\nresponse times, more\
    \ efﬁcient processing, and less pressure on the network.\nMEC is widely acknowledged\
    \ as a vital technology to implement many methods for\nnext-generation IoT applications.\
    \ Due to their versatility and ease of deployment, UAVs\ncan play various roles\
    \ in delivering edge computing services. UAV-enabled MEC designs\ncan be classiﬁed\
    \ and dedicated to a speciﬁc application scenario. A UAV can be considered\nas\
    \ a mobile EC server, an IoT node, or a relay. Firstly, UAVs can participate in\
    \ the system as\nmobile devices when they ofﬂoad their computing to an MEC server.\
    \ Secondly, the UAV\ncan act as the MEC responsible for monitoring a group of\
    \ mobile end nodes. Thirdly, the\nUAV can serve as a relay or gateway between\
    \ mobile end nodes and an MEC server.\nThe UAV may be regarded as a speciﬁc user\
    \ that could ofﬂoad those computing tasks\nexceeding its memory and processing\
    \ capacity to a MEC server, as shown in Figure 4a.\nUAVs typically have limited\

    \ of data\nis ofﬂoaded to the edge devices; this requires developing mechanisms\
    \ that manage and\nexploit the data for various purposes, such as auto-maintenance,\

    \ EC devices and centralized cloud\nservers regarding their processing capacities\
    \ and memory, limiting multiple AI technolo-\ngies for data processing at the\
    \ edge. Therefore, numerous criteria should be considered\nwhen incorporating\
    \ any AI technique to proﬁt from their robustness, due to memory ca-\npacity and\

    manner, allowing faster addressing of user demands than a regular CC, even with\

    \ not require labeled training data for resource allocation. Thus,\nit may enhance\
    \ the process of ofﬂoading choices based on various states of the channel en-\n\
    vironment. This results in reducing the energy bandwidth and computations. To\
    \ that end,\nan MDP method was provided to reduce the delay, energy consumption,\
    \ and bandwidth\nin UAV-assisted MEC by analyzing the instability of energy arrival,\

    \ This is particularly true for joint optimization\nchallenges to improve system\
    \ efﬁciency. Furthermore, UAV communication will be incor-\nporated with 6G networks,\

    \ have proved that the deep supervised learning (DSL) method min-\nimizes the\
    \ computation and ofﬂoading overheads and cost of mobile users in the MEC\nsystem.\
    \ This technique allows terrestrial users to obtain an optimal ofﬂoading policy,\
    \ with\nenergy-saving and processing speed enhancement.\nThe authors of [91] have\
    \ investigated the challenges associated with applying AI\ntechniques to UAV-NOMA-MEC\
    \ networks. They proposed an architecture that relies\non AI-based approaches,\
    \ particularly on federated learning and reinforcement learning.\nThe proposed\
    \ framework was dedicated to enabling terrestrial mobile users to ofﬂoad\ntheir\
    \ computational tasks simultaneously, intelligently, and ﬂexibly, thus enhancing\
    \ their\nconnectivity and reducing their transmission latency and energy consumption.\n\
    The authors of [135] used RL and transfer learning algorithms to reduce the latency\
    \ and\nenergy consumption in UAV-enabled MEC networks. They proved that transfer\
    \ learning,\nwhen combined with RL, could signiﬁcantly enhance the system training\
    \ performance\nwhen the users operated dynamically.\nAn optimization problem based\
    \ on MDP was formulated by the authors of [35] to\naddress UAV trajectory optimization\
    \ in UAV-mounted MEC networks. The approach\naimed to enhance the overall system\
    \ QoS, maximize the long-term system reward, and\nmeet the QoS constraint, including\
    \ the computation tasks of mobile users. In [136], the\nauthors have used the\
    \ semi-Markov process and DRL-based algorithms to address the\nUAV-enabled MEC\
    \ networks’ ofﬂoading decisions and resource management policies.\nThe authors\
    \ of [137] have developed a platform known as a ﬂying UAV MEC, in which\nUAVs\
    \ are outﬁtted with computing resources and provide task-ofﬂoading services to\
    \ users.\nThe suggested architecture’s primary purpose was to maximize UAV aerial\
    \ trajectory,\nuser association, and resource allocation. The trajectory control\
    \ method has been used\nto address the optimization issue, assisted by an RL-based\
    \ technique. The results of this\napproach outperformed the results of the equivalent\
    \ benchmark methods. Moreover, the\nauthors of [138] formulated an ML-based novel\
    \ framework to optimize UAV trajectories\nby estimating the user’s mobility data\
    \ to ﬁnd optimal initial UAV placement locations.\nThe joint problem, consisting\
    \ of UAVs trajectories and power control to improve the sum\nrate and maintain\
    \ the data rate requirements of mobile users, was also addressed in the\nemployment\
    \ of a multi-agent Q-learning-based technique. A smart ofﬂoading based on the\n\
    deep Q-learning approach was proposed by the authors of [139] to optimize performance\n\
    in terms of the delay perceived by ground devices connected to the FANET, to enable\
    \ MEC\nin the 5G ﬁeld.\n5. Discussion and Open Issues\nComputational intelligence,\
    \ when combined with UAVs, has improved the underlying\ntechnologies and implementations\
    \ of IoT applications. Nevertheless, researchers should\naddress the remaining\
    \ challenges. Therefore, some signiﬁcant issues need more attention\nin order\
    \ to beneﬁt from UAVs for the realization of ﬂying ECs. These issues may be\n\
    related to scientiﬁc, technological, and societal problems, including challenges\
    \ regarding\nthe technical aspects of the technology, security and privacy concerns,\
    \ and standardization.\nThe challenges concern both the UAVs themselves and EC\
    \ devices. Therefore, great effort\nis needed to address the following challenges.\n\
    Energy consumption: In any UAV-enabled IoT system, most sensors, edge devices,\
    \ and\ndrones are battery-powered and can only remain powered for a limited period.\
    \ Therefore,\nefﬁcient energy consumption protocols and mechanisms are essential\
    \ for UAVs and IoT de-\nvices to ensure a long network lifetime. Improvement efforts\
    \ should address the hardware\nand software architecture of the IoT components\
    \ by integrating energy-harvesting solutions\nor efﬁcient routing protocols. For\
    \ example, AI schemes can be adopted to predict a UAV’s\nresidual energy and energy\
    \ dissipation through the precise adjustment of transmission\nand control parameters\
    \ concerning channel changes. The processing energy dissipation,\ncommunication\
    \ energy, storage energy, and environmental reliability should be considered\n\
    to mitigate the energy of UAVs [115,140]. Moreover, the issues listed below should\
    \ also\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n22 of 30\nbe considered to mitigate energy consumption,\
    \ to extend the on-air ﬂying time of the\nUAVs employed.\nInterference: The communication\
    \ links between UAVs and IoT devices may become\ndisconnected due to interference,\
    \ which reduces latency performance and may also affect\nthe overall network,\
    \ especially when the UAVs act as a mobile BS. Therefore, the problem\nof interference\
    \ should be addressed, especially in urban and industrial environments,\nwhere\
    \ the number of interconnected devices on the same frequency band is very dense.\
    \ An\nAI-based solution can be applied in UAV-enabled MEC to predict the signal-to-interference\n\
    ratio, based on the collected channel state information (CSI). It is then possible\
    \ to decide on\nthe most appropriate scheme to combat the impact of interference\
    \ or to adjust transmission\nparameters in order to reduce power consumption.\n\
    Interoperability: In any IoT environment, many devices are expected to handle\
    \ the\nrequired tasks without any effort from the end-users. These devices try\
    \ to connect and\ninteract with each other using different protocols and communication\
    \ paradigms. With\nthis diversity, it is sometimes challenging to orchestrate\
    \ the system smoothly. Therefore,\nfurther investigations are necessary to unify\
    \ the controller and communication protocols to\nensure interoperability among\
    \ them.\nMobility and path planning: UAVs require auto-maneuvering without distant\
    \ hu-\nman pilot intervention in random dynamic IoT applications. Therefore, many\
    \ intelligent\nmethods should be considered to enable autonomous UAV ﬂights that\
    \ include collision\navoidance. AI algorithms are the most viable solutions that\
    \ can be used to detect obsta-\ncles and avoid collisions [141]. For instance,\
    \ DL techniques can enable learning from the\ngathered data, which makes their\
    \ integration into UAV a signiﬁcant solution. A serious\neffort should be considered\
    \ to develop green-federated AI solutions, such as RL, to ensure\naccurate auto-ﬂying\
    \ decisions and path and trajectory planning [35,132].\nScalability: The scalability\
    \ challenges concern resources, applications, load balancing,\nand connections.\
    \ Enabling high scalability requires designing efﬁcient schemes that could\neffectively\
    \ manage heterogeneous mobile devices and servers in a UAV-enabled MEC\nenvironment,\
    \ with its highly dynamic demand behavior. For example, some mobile appli-\ncations,\
    \ such as UAVs and autonomous driving, require high data throughput ofﬂoading\
    \ to\nsuccessfully provide such services, despite heterogeneity in the number\
    \ of mobile devices\nand the dynamic demand behavior of the applications mentioned\
    \ in the MEC environment.\nThe MEC system should have an acceptable degree of\
    \ scalability regarding the number\nof servers and services required. As a result,\
    \ it is challenging for difﬁcult areas to estab-\nlish connections and communications\
    \ between mobile devices and servers. To achieve\nconvenient and cost-effective\
    \ mobility and scalability, resulting in continuous service, it is\nnecessary\
    \ to have a stable connection, even in adverse environmental conditions.\nSecurity:\
    \ Drones enable ubiquitous services on an IoT scale. The communications\nand controls\
    \ are realized through P2P wireless transmissions and thus are open to many\n\
    security threats. Therefore, unauthorized connections threaten the system’s privacy.\
    \ It is\nnecessary to propose and design security mechanisms to improve UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC sys-\ntems’ security [142]. The effort should focus on the physical, application,\
    \ and MAC layers.\nThe solutions should integrate recent robust techniques such\
    \ as blockchains, especially\nin IoT applications where UAVs are expected to facilitate\
    \ communication networks. The\ncombination of UAVs with blockchain and AI is now\
    \ an exciting avenue of research to\npredict all sorts of attacks and malware\
    \ that threaten the system’s privacy [127]. However,\nwhile there has been signiﬁcant\
    \ progress in this area, more work needs to be done. Power\nconsumption might\
    \ be a critical constraint for blockchain-based applications as they need\nmore\
    \ computing power. Increasingly complex attacks, such as quantum attacks, ML,\
    \ and\ntheory-based game attacks, could challenge the privacy of blockchain systems\
    \ [143]. More\nresearch is needed to make private blockchain networks more immutable\
    \ and secure in\nUAV-enabled MEC architectures. Moreover, blockchain-enabled softwarization\
    \ for secure\nUAV network systems is also a critical challenge. Blockchain implementation\
    \ in UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n23 of 30\nsystems presents a complex system integration\
    \ problem requiring rigorous testing before\nconcrete implementation [12].\nIntegration\
    \ of AI schemes: Recently, the utilization of AI schemes among DL, ML, and\nRL\
    \ has become increasingly of interest, to beneﬁt from their powerful performance.\
    \ AI\nschemes are being integrated into UAV-enabled MEC systems as a way to make\
    \ contextual\ndecisions and learn from aggregated data gathered from previous\
    \ tracking experiences. The\ndata collected by the sensors in real-time can be\
    \ proﬁtably exploited for the autonomous\npiloting of UAVs. Therefore, processing\
    \ tasks demand strict computing and storage\nrequirements at computing facilities,\
    \ to be executed exceptionally at the edge. UAVs\nalso have energy and storage\
    \ limitations; thus, portable and lightweight RL, ML, and DL\nalgorithms should\
    \ be designed to cope with these constraints.\nRegulations: Despite the rapid\
    \ emergence of this technology, UAV regulations are\nstill in their infancy, and\
    \ a lack of heterogeneity of national rules and varying levels of\nimplementation\
    \ can be observed. These regulations differ from state to state, and the type\n\
    of regulation is based on the requirements of that use. Several problems are associated\
    \ with\nUAV regulation, including delays in ﬂight approval and poorly documented\
    \ administrative\nprocesses limiting the desired ﬂexibility, preventing widespread\
    \ use of the technology [144].\nLatency and computation issues: Communication\
    \ latency and computing optimization\nremain concerns in MEC-enabled UAV applications,\
    \ affecting transmission efﬁciency and\nreaction time under communication and\
    \ computing constraints. UAV transmission success\nmay be accomplished by offering\
    \ effective methods that decrease response delay. In\none study [145], for example,\
    \ stochastic geometry and queueing theory approaches were\nstudied to minimize\
    \ the response delay for a MEC-enabled UAV network.\nResource allocation: Due\
    \ to UAV battery concerns and trajectory constraints, resource\nallocation is\
    \ critical in UAV-enabled MEC networks. Resources allocation is involved in\n\
    three processes: computing task ofﬂoading, local computing, and UAV hovering.\
    \ Design-\ning an appropriate trajectory can ultimately compromise the calculated\
    \ performance and\noperating costs. According to the authors of [146], resource\
    \ allocation may be structured to\nmeet various goals, including computing bit\
    \ maximization, energy minimization, compu-\ntational efﬁciency maximization,\
    \ cost minimization, completion time minimization, and\nthe consideration of fairness.\n\
    UAV-enabled IoT for B5G and 6G issues: Data-gathering faces several problems in\
    \ IoT\nthat extend beyond the ﬁfth-generation (B5G) and upcoming sixth-generation\
    \ (6G) wireless\nmobile networks. A large amount of data will be generated by\
    \ heterogeneous devices,\nparticularly IoT devices and smartphones at the mobile\
    \ edge; these data are fragmented and\ndispersed among several machines. Therefore,\
    \ distributed solutions such as UAV-enabled\nMEC should be leveraged near mobile\
    \ users to ofﬂoad and process the data. Meanwhile,\ngrowing privacy concerns make\
    \ data collecting increasingly challenging. This consumes\nmore energy and decreases\
    \ the system’s ofﬂoading time [147].\n6. Conclusions\nThe development of wireless\
    \ communication technologies and IT services has made\nthe role of drones more\
    \ ubiquitous in various ﬁelds of application. Drones can serve\nas a link between\
    \ smart devices and cloud data centers, to provide many services that\ncan increase\
    \ the performance of a given IoT system. To the best of our knowledge, this\n\
    paper is considered the ﬁrst work that provides a review of drone-enabled MECs\
    \ based on\nAI. This work discusses the current research trends and provides future\
    \ insights into the\npotential uses of UAV-enabled MEC in the ﬁeld of IoT. It\
    \ highlights the potential roles that\nUAVs can play in enabling communications\
    \ and intelligent computing in the IoT era, by\nreferring to the most widely emerging\
    \ AI techniques that are employed. As mentioned,\nUAVs as MECs are attracting\
    \ considerable interest in scientiﬁc research, to address the\nvarious problems\
    \ and challenges experienced in order to improve the performance of such\napplications\
    \ in different scenarios, such as resource allocation, energy efﬁciency, latency,\n\
    task ofﬂoading, and security. UAV-enabled MEC present an emerging concept that\
    \ require\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n24 of 30\nmore effort to achieve the necessary\
    \ performance in every scenario of UAV application in\nIoT environments, especially\

    Copy Abstract Development of agriculture in Russia and Belarus is based on the
    practical implementation of "smart" systems in agriculture based on the use of
    modern wireless, intelligent technologies and Internet of Things. This review
    presents research articles (mainly, in Russian) published in the period of 2013
    – 2022 on the use of cloud technologies and Internet of Things for the development
    of agriculture in Russia and Belarus. An analysis of the use of cloud technologies
    and Internet of Things in the modern world is given on the basis of research articles
    and reviews published in English in the period of 2017 – 2022. The main directions
    of digitalization of modern agriculture are listed. The uses of cloud technologies
    and Internet of Things in agriculture are described along with promising directions
    for further research and applications. Keywords modern agriculture; smart farming;

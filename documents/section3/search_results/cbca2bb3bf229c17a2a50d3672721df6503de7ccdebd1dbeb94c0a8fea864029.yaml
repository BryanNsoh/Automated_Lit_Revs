  description: Understanding spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water within fields
    is critical for effective variable rate irrigation (VRI) management. The objectives
    of this study were to develop VRI zones, manage irrigation rates within VRI zones,
    and examine temporal differences in soil volumetric water content (VWC) from irrigation
    events via soil sensors across zones. Five irrigation zones were delineated after
    two years (2016 and 2017) of yield and evapotranspiration (ET) data collection.
    Soil sensors were placed within each zone to give real time data of VWC values
    and assist in irrigation decisions within a 23 ha field of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
    ‘UI Magic’) near Grace, Idaho, USA (2019). Cumulative irrigation rates among zones
    ranged from 236 to 298 mm. Although a statistical comparison could not be made,
    the irrigation rates were 0.6 to 21% less than an estimated uniform grower standard
    practice (GSP) irrigation approach. Based on soil sensor data, crop water stress
    was avoided with VRI management in all but Zone 3. Thus, this simple approach
    to VRI zone delineation and VWC monitoring has the potential to reduce irrigation,
    such as this study, on average by 12% and should be evaluated in other site-years
    to assess its viability.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Understanding spatial and temporal dynamics of
    soil water within fields is critical for effective variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    management. The objectives of this study were to develop VRI zones, manage irrigation
    rates within VRI zones, and examine temporal differences in soil volumetric water
    content (VWC) from irrigation events via soil sensors across zones. Five irrigation
    zones were delineated after two years (2016 and 2017) of yield and evapotranspiration
    (ET) data collection. Soil sensors were placed within each zone to give real time
    data of VWC values and assist in irrigation decisions within a 23 ha field of
    winter wheat (Triticum aestivum ‘UI Magic’) near Grace, Idaho, USA (2019). Cumulative
    irrigation rates among zones ranged from 236 to 298 mm. Although a statistical
    comparison could not be made, the irrigation rates were 0.6 to 21% less than an
    estimated uniform grower standard practice (GSP) irrigation approach. Based on
    soil sensor data, crop water stress was avoided with VRI management in all but
    Zone 3. Thus, this simple approach to VRI zone delineation and VWC monitoring
    has the potential to reduce irrigation, such as this study, on average by 12%
    and should be evaluated in other site-years to assess its viability. Keywords:

    1.1. Yield and Crop Water Needs Are Spatially and Temporally Variable Variation
    of crop yields are often related to factors, such as topographical changes, soil
    texture and property differences, compaction, nutrient variability, and pest distribution
    differences [1]. Significant within-field variation in yield has been observed
    even in fields that appear somewhat uniform. Some areas of a field may consistently
    produce lower or higher yields, while other areas are variable from year-to-year
    due to many interacting factors [2]. For example, Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin
    et al. (2019) [4] found that wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) yields ranged from
    2.3 to 10.6 Mg ha−1 in a field with minimal topographic variation. One underlying
    cause of within-field yield variation of irrigated crops is spatiotemporal variation
    of soil water content, which varies significantly in seemingly uniform fields
    [5]. Understanding within-field and temporal variation of soil water can improve
    understanding of yield variation and inform precision management practices to
    improve resource use efficiency. Agricultural irrigators using pressurized water
    delivery systems typically apply uniform irrigation as they seek to ensure that
    no area of the field is visibly water stressed [6]. However, uniform irrigation
    ignores variations in soil properties, nutrient availability, topographic features,
    microclimates, pest and pathogen pressure, and other factors that affect crop
    water use [3,4,7]. As a result, a field that is irrigated uniformly with an application
    of the average amount of water use would create water deficits in some areas within
    a field and surpluses in others [8]. Spatial variation of yield and crop water
    use have been linked to the variability of a wide variety of soil physical and
    chemical properties, such as texture, depth, water holding capacity, and apparent
    soil electrical conductivity (ECa) [5,9,10], as well as organic matter, topography,
    compaction, hydrophobicity, subsurface layers, nutrient deficiencies, pH, salinity/sodicity,
    and soil borne pathogens, nematodes, and insects [11]. The most visually obvious
    spatial differences are often related to topography. However, high within-field
    variability in soil water properties has been observed in mechanically leveled
    fields with minimal topographical undulations [5,12]. Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin
    et al. (2019) [4] found surprisingly large differences in soil water holding capacity
    (SWHC) in a field with minimal apparent variation in many soil properties and
    topographical features. 1.2. Delineating and Managing Zones for VRI Relatively
    new technology allows for a variable rate irrigation (VRI) in an effort to more
    precisely apply the water that is needed by a crop to potentially improve yields
    and reduce waste. The effectiveness of VRI is determined by accurately predicting
    variable water needs in zones within a field. Developing these zones can be performed
    by determining various static properties but are complicated by dynamic events
    that change year to year. Soil properties are among the static conditions that
    are generally used to delineate VRI zones [6,13,14,15]. Many of these static soil
    properties impact the spatial variability of SWHC, which has been shown to influence
    yield and crop water use [10,16], including within-field variations of these properties
    [5,9]. As such, variation in SWHC is utilized to delineate zones [6,8,14,17,18]
    and inform VRI to help maximize crop production per unit of land and water [11].
    While within-field variability of soil properties is important for characterizing
    VRI zones, topographical features also play a role in zone delineation. General
    topographic features used to describe within-field variability are elevation,
    slope, aspect, and curvature [2,19,20]. Water tends to move within fields from
    areas of higher elevation to lower areas of the field and often results in yield
    variation related to deficient, optimum, or excessive levels of water availability
    [2,3,4,21,22]. Combining topographical features with historical yield patterns,
    explained below, has been useful in delineating irrigation management zones for
    VRI [3,4,19]. While VRI zone delineation based on static soil properties or topographical
    features is common, some research has indicated that considering dynamic soil
    or crop factors could improve VRI management [5,7,23]. Examples of dynamic factors
    impacting crop water stress include variable precipitation and other weather conditions,
    snow accumulation impacting depth of soil water in spring, disease or pest pressure,
    and nutrient deficiencies [3,4,5,7,23]. These dynamic factors combine with the
    static variation of soil properties to make complex and variable spatial patterns
    of crop yields and evapotranspiration (ET). Modeling daily ET for estimating crop
    water demand utilizing soil water sensors and remote sensing of the crop canopy
    are approaches that have been used to describe these spatially variable patterns
    [14,24,25,26]. Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin et al. (2019) [4] found variable soil
    water dynamics throughout a field of winter wheat, such as spring soil volumetric
    water content (VWC). These have been effective variables in predicting late season
    crop water stress in arid regions [27]. Although irrigation zones have been characterized
    with soil and topographical properties, other dynamic field data, especially historical
    yield and ET, may improve the delineation of zones. Utilizing these other dynamic
    factors are not common within zone delineation for VRI management [17,28]. However,
    Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin et al. (2019) [4] collected multiple years of yield
    data in a field with a wheat–wheat–potato cropping system and found consistency
    in yield patterns were apparent. These yield patterns likely have an impact on
    irrigation needs. Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin et al. (2019) [4] combined yield
    data with ET to delineate zones based on productivity. This method could inform
    growers on how to delineate zones to irrigate their fields most efficiently. In-season
    VRI management can be achieved with buried soil water matric potential (MP) or
    VWC sensors measuring temporal variation. [29,30]. Sensor costs and installation
    time generally prevent their use for high density spatial coverage within production
    fields, and selecting locations for sensors within a field presents an important
    challenge [29,31,32]. Delineating VRI zones has been performed using variables,
    such as topography and static soil properties, but experiments using dynamic variables,
    such as historical yield and ET patterns to create zones, and then irrigated with
    soil sensors require more examination. The objectives of this study were to: (i)
    develop VRI zones using observations of within-field variation in crop yield and
    ET; (ii) manage spatially and temporally unique irrigation rates within VRI zones
    for a winter wheat crop; and (iii) assess whether VRI was effective at maintaining
    VWC within zone-specific soil bands of readily available water. 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Study Site This study was conducted on three years (2016, 2017, and
    2019) of spatial and temporal data collected from a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
    ‘UI Magic’) field (23 ha) near Grace, ID, USA (elevation 1706 m above sea level;
    42.60904 latitude and −111.788 longitude; ArcGIS Pro 2.7.1, Redlands, CA, USA).
    The previous crop in 2015 and 2018 was potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) with the
    historic cropping system of wheat–wheat–potato. The field is in a semi-arid region
    with a climate typified with relatively hot days and cool nights during the summer
    growing season with an average air temperature of 15 °C and about 80 to 110 frost-free
    days. Average annual precipitation is 0.39 m [33] with most of the precipitation
    occurring during winter as snowfall. The growing season precipitation (May–August)
    was below average (0.15 m) [33] during the time of this trial, with precipitation
    between spring soil sampling and harvest totaling to 0.099, 0.090, and 0.092 m
    in 2016, 2017, and 2019, respectively. The soil is a silty clay loam Rexburg-Ririe
    complex, with 1 to 4 % slopes, described as coarse-silty, mixed, superactive,
    frigid Calcic Haploxerolls that derive from alluvial influenced loess [34]. The
    field has a 6 m difference between the lowest and highest elevation (Figure 1).
    Figure 1. Image of field research site near Grace, ID, USA, with elevation contour
    lines (m), 2019 VRI management zones, soil sample points, and soil volumetric
    water content (VWC) sensor locations. Soil texture was measured at four 0.3 m
    depth increments from the surface level down to 1.2 m at 46 spatially distributed
    sites (70 m grid) across the field. The silty clay loam texture was confirmed
    at 42 of the sample sites, and the remaining four sites were classified as silty
    clay. Irrigation was applied using a 380 m center pivot with a 5 m nozzle spacing
    equipped with a zone-control VRI system (GrowSmart Precision VRI, Lindsay Corporation,
    Omaha, NE, USA). Irrigation events occurred every 5–7 days in spring and every
    3–5 days during summer at peak ET. There are 0.3 ha of shallow and emerged bedrock
    that are not farmed or irrigated, and these water savings are not included in
    the results of this study but are certainly part of the overall savings experienced
    by the grower. The cooperating grower managed all aspects of wheat production.
    2.2. Soil Volumetric Water Content (VWC) The soil sampling grid (70 m) was determined
    from the range (140 m) of a fitted semi-variogram determined using the approach
    of Kerry and Oliver [35], which recommends using a grid interval of half the variogram
    range for a variogram of ancillary data that are related to the property of interest.
    The semi-variogram for this sampling grid was calculated from the 1 m resolution
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from a color-infrared National Agriculture
    Imagery Program (NAIP) of bare soil imagery from winter of 2015, https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-aerial-photography-national-agriculture-imagery-program-naip
    (accessed on 3 April 2023). In 2016 and 2017, 46 gridded samples were collected
    on the 70 m grid, with an additional 39 random sample points (85 total). These
    additional random samples at shorter intervals mean that when interpolating data
    for any measured variable, the nugget variance of the variogram is more accurately
    estimated, and this will give more accurate kriged estimates. Beginning in 2019,
    56 nested sample sites were collected as well as the 46 gridded sample points
    (102 total). This sampling scheme was used to calculate the spatial variation
    of soil VWC and soil water depletion over time. Soil samples were collected on
    18 April and 20 August 2016, 4 May and 1 September 2017, and 23 April, 30 May,
    25 June, and 5 September 2019. These samples were used within each year to calculate
    ET from a season-long water balance equation, calculate crop water productivity
    (CWP), initialize a daily soil water depletion model, and compute reliable variograms
    for kriging [36]. Mid-season soil samples were collected at all locations on 30
    May, and half of the sampling locations on 25 June in 2019 to provide further
    in-depth, in-season validation calculations for the soil water depletion model
    used. Soil samples were collected using a 0.051 m diameter soil probe in 2016
    and 2017. In 2019, soil probes with a diameter of 0.019 m were driven into the
    profile with a modified gas-powered post driver (AMS, Inc. American Falls, ID,
    USA). At each sampling point, a soil core was taken to approximate the final depth
    of rooting at increments of 0–0.3, 0.3–0.6, 0.6–0.9, and 0.9–1.2 m. Samples were
    sealed for transport to the laboratory where gravimetric soil water content was
    determined by drying in a forced-air oven at 105 °C until consistent weights were
    reached. Soil gravimetric water content was converted to VWC using soil bulk density
    values determined in 2016 from previous samples [3,4]. Prior to geostatistical
    analysis of soil VWC, yield, ET, and CWP, summary statistics were calculated and
    histograms plotted. If the skewness of the dataset was outside the bounds of ±1,
    then the data were transformed to logarithms for variogram computation and backtransformed
    to the original scale following kriging [37]. Following variogram computation,
    each variable was ordinary kriged to a 5 m grid. All variograms and kriging was
    completed using SpaceStat (BioMedware, SpaceStat 4, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and ArcGIS
    desktop: Release 10 (Redlands, CA, USA). JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
    USA) was used for distribution statistics. 2.3. Evapotranspiration The ET for
    the wheat growing season (18 April–20 August 2016, 4 May–1 September 2017, and
    23 April–5 September 2019) was calculated for each sampling location within the
    field using the following water balance equation: 𝐸𝑇=𝑃+𝐼+∆𝑆−𝑅𝑂−𝐷 (1) where “P”
    is total season-long precipitation (m), “I” is total season-long irrigation (m),
    “ΔS” is the change in the depth of soil water in a 1.2 m deep profile between
    sampling events at spring green-up and harvest, “RO” is surface water runoff (m),
    and “D” is soil water drainage (m) below the sampling depth. Drainage was calculated
    from a separate daily soil water balance as any amount of water (P + I) that exceeded
    site specific field capacity (FC) values for the 1.2 m deep profile. Reference
    ET and crop coefficients from the cooperative agricultural weather network AgriMet
    [33] were used to determine the daily soil water balance. Seasonal RO was assumed
    negligible because the greatest daily precipitation event was 0.0086 m, and soil
    infiltration rates exceeded this amount, and there were no visible indications
    of surface water movement. The season-long ET water balance calculation began
    at the date of spring soil sampling and ended at the date of the fall soil sampling.
    2.4. Yield and Crop Water Productivity Grain was harvested with a commercial combine
    equipped with a calibrated yield monitor (New Holland IntelliView 4, Turin, Italy)
    using a mass flow sensor collecting yield data every 10 m2. The yield data were
    processed as described by Kerry and Oliver [35]. Erroneous data points were defined
    as outside the limits of ±75% of the median. In addition, points where the wheat
    combine did not harvest the full header width were removed. Wheat yield data were
    calibrated using a weigh cart and validated with wheat bin storage showing an
    overall accuracy of ±1%. Season-long ET at each sample location was used to calculate
    CWP. Crop water productivity was calculated as follows: 𝐶𝑊𝑃=𝑌/𝐸𝑇 (2) where Y is
    yield (kg ha−1) and ET is season-long evapotranspiration (mm) assessed at each
    sample point from pre-planting to harvest. 2.5. Irrigation Management Zones Irrigation
    zones for 2019 were created from yield and ET data collected from 2016 and 2017
    [3,4,38]. In 2016, yield and ET were evaluated under the grower standard practice
    (GSP) of uniform irrigation. In 2017, yield and ET were evaluated under VRI with
    irrigation treatments created based on three years (2013, 2014, 2016) of yield
    data and CWP in 2016 [3,4]. The 2017 irrigation included low (0.7 × GSP) and high
    (1.3 × GSP) irrigation treatments and two control strips (GSP) for within-year
    comparisons. Irrigation differences among treatments were created to give plus-or-minus
    15% difference in season-long ET. The observed reactions of the field to 2017
    irrigation treatments were used to create and manage spatially variable irrigation
    zones for the 2019 growing season. This was accomplished by using a regression
    where yield was the response variable and ET was the explanatory variable. Then,
    a k-means clustering algorithm was conducted based on the slope of the regression
    and with constraints for spatial contiguity to map out the five irrigation zones
    (Figure 1) [17]. During the 2019 growing season, irrigation rates for each zone
    were derived by comparing VWC measured by sensors in each zone to the zone average
    FC values and applied to bring the upper 0.3 m soil depth to a soil water content
    approximately equal to FC [38]. Irrigations were timed to keep water depletion
    from decreasing below readily available water (RAW). Cumulative irrigation amounts
    in each zone were compared with a cumulative estimated GSP irrigation amount.
    The 2019 GSP rates were estimated from a combination of historical GSP rates from
    the same crop under uniform irrigation and considering rates from a neighboring
    field with a similar crop during that same year. The FC values were approximated
    within each zone by averaging the greatest of the three green-up (wheat at early
    spring) observed VWC values for each soil sample within their given zones between
    2016 and 2018. The FC was assumed based on the soil being recently saturated from
    melting snow and spring precipitation but having at least three days for drainage
    with minimal ET losses during this time. Wilting point (WP) was assumed from fall
    soil samples because the soils had been dried down for harvest with 15, 7.1, and
    1.3 mm of rainfall 18, 25, and 16 d after the last irrigation event for 2016,
    2017, and 2019, respectively. The WP values were chosen from the lowest VWC values
    between these three years of sampling at the post-harvest sampling dates. The
    WP assumption was validated on 39 samples using a Decagon WP4C (WP4C Dewpoint
    Potentiometer, METER Group, Inc.—formally Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) to
    estimate the relationship between VWC and water potential. For each validation
    sample, 4–5 known volumetric moisture values were analyzed on the WP4C to calculate
    water potential. Using a logarithmic fitted line, VWC was estimated at −1500 kPa
    for each sample and compared to the field estimated WP. All measured volumetric
    WP values were within ±10% of the fall VWC values for individual depths, and within
    a 5% error when averaged for the whole soil profile, verifying the assumption
    that fall soil samples were at or very near WP. The soil water retained between
    FC and WP was calculated as total available water (TAW, mm), which is the water
    available to the plant, using the following equation: TAW = 1000 (FC − WP) Zr
    (3) where “FC” is field capacity (m), “WP” is wilting point (m), and “Zr” is the
    rooting depth (m). Readily available water (RAW) is the portion of water within
    the TAW that can be taken up by plants before the plant develops crop stress.
    The equation to calculate RAW is as follows: 𝑅𝐴𝑊=𝑝𝑇𝐴𝑊 (4) where “ 𝑝 ” is the average
    fraction of TAW that can be depleted from the root zone before the crop experiences
    stress and yields are limited. The 𝑝 value of 0.55 was assigned to the winter
    wheat crop [39]. 2.6. VWC Data Collection through Soil Sensors in 2019 During
    the 2019 growing season, soil sensors were installed to measure VWC (TEROS 12,
    METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and soil MP (TEROS 21, Meter, Pullman, WA,
    USA) with data loggers (ZL6, METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) in each of the
    five irrigation zones. The location of the sensors placed within each zone was
    chosen to reflect the average measured VWC for that zone. One of each sensor type
    was installed 0.03–0.05 m apart at 0.15 and 0.45 m below the soil surface with
    an additional VWC sensor at 0.75 m depth at each of the five locations (Figure
    1). The sensors logged data every 15 min. The loggers and sensors were installed
    on April 23 and removed just prior to harvest on August 20. 3. Results 3.1. Zone
    Delineation by Observed CWP Under uniform irrigation in 2016, the field average
    yield was 7.5 Mg ha−1 with a range of 2.3–10.6 Mg ha−1 and a field average ET
    of 520 mm with a range of 315–571 mm (Figure 2). Figure 2. Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) zones (first row), spatially variable wheat yield (second row), evapotranspiration
    (ET) (third row), and crop water productivity (CWP) (fourth row) for 2016 and
    2017. These data were used to create the irrigation management zones for 2019.
    Under spatially variable irrigation in 2017, a similar yield range was observed
    (1.8–8.4 Mg ha−1), but the field average yield decreased to 5.8 Mg ha−1 (Figure
    2). This phenomenon is common in second-year wheat grown in wheat–wheat–potato
    crop rotations as disease and pest pressure increase within the second wheat year
    [40,41,42], and it is assumed that the observed differences are not because of
    the change in irrigation practice. The irrigation treatments did influence yield
    within 2017 with the low and high irrigation treatments averaging 4.9 and 6.4
    Mg ha−1, respectively. Average ET was 497 mm with a range of 255–620 mm (Figure
    2). The low and high zones had an average ET of 435 and 573 mm, respectively.
    Although the range of yield was less in 2017 than 2016, it is notable that the
    range of ET was 109 mm greater in 2017. The spatial pattern of ET was largely
    dictated by irrigation treatments while the spatial pattern in the yield was similar
    to that observed under uniform irrigation in 2016. These comparisons were made
    to evaluate crop water response under variable conditions, and no statistical
    comparisons of yield across years were performed. In these years, CWP patterns
    were more closely related to yield than ET. In 2016, average CWP was 14 kg ha−1
    mm−1 with a range of 4.7–21 kg ha−1 mm−1 (Figure 2). In 2017, average CWP was
    11 kg ha−1 mm−1 with a range of 4.1–19 kg ha−1 mm−1 (Figure 2). In 2016, CWP generally
    increased in areas where ET was lower. Similarly, in 2017, yields improved but
    CWP decreased in the high irrigation treatment areas where 30% more irrigation
    was applied. For the low treatment where irrigation was decreased by 30%, yields
    decreased and CWP increased. 3.2. 2019 Variable Rate Irrigation A five-zone VRI
    map for 2019 was generated based on the CWP from both uniform and variable irrigation
    seasons in 2016 and 2017 (Figure 1). Irrigation rates were unique for each zone
    and irrigation event. The total area in each zone was 2.5, 7.7, 3.6, 7.2, and
    1.8 ha for Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Variable irrigation rates in
    2019 were determined from observed VWC values from installed soil sensors and
    zone-specific average FC values. Temporal changes in soil-sensor VWC for each
    zone are depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3. Temporal change in volumetric water content
    (VWC) at a depth of 0.0–0.3 m for a wheat crop in 2019 under variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) with five irrigation zones. Precipitation and zone-specific VRI events are
    also shown. Zone average field capacity (FC) and readily available water (RAW)
    are identified with blue and red lines, respectively. The VRI irrigation scheduling
    approach was successful in maintaining VWC between FC and RAW during critical
    growth stages in each zone, except for a short time in Zone 3 (Figure 3). The
    distinctive VWC patterns between irrigation zones provide evidence for value from
    VRI. There was a total of 14 irrigation events, beginning at 131 d after planting
    (May 11) and ending at 199 d (July 18). Applied irrigation rates for individual
    events and zones ranged from 5 to 28 mm, with an average application of 15 mm
    per event (Table 1). Table 1. Date of application and irrigation amounts within
    each of the five delineated irrigation zones throughout the 2019 growing season.
    Estimated grower standard practice (GSP) rates are compared to the rates of the
    other irrigation zones throughout the season. Uniform rates were applied on 6/18
    and 7/2 for fertigation purposes. Total season-long irrigation averaged 262 mm
    for the entire field, with 285, 236, 298, 237, and 254 mm in Zones 1, 2, 3, 4,
    and 5, respectively (Figure 4 and Table 1). Figure 4. Cumulative irrigation for
    winter wheat in 2019 under variable rate irrigation (VRI) with five irrigation
    zones compared to the estimated cumulative grower standard practice (GSP) from
    11 May to 18 July with irrigation events represented by the unique shapes for
    each zone. Although the study was not designed to statistically compare VRI to
    a control, it is useful to compare to the 2019 estimated GSP. The GSP for this
    field would have had 17 irrigation events of 18 mm each for a total of 300 mm
    (Table 1). Compared to the estimated GSP, these season-long irrigation amounts
    represent 5, 21, 0.6, 21, and 14% (2–64 mm) less water for Zones 1 through 5,
    respectively, with an overall average of a 12% reduction. 4. Discussion 4.1. Zone
    Delineation Commonly employed methods of delineating VRI zones include TAW, electrical
    conductivity data, yield data, and others [14,17,28]. Utilizing a combination
    of yield and ET from historical data is a relatively simple approach that has
    not been widely considered. Widespread adoption of on-the-go yield sensors provides
    easily accessible yield information. Implementation of measuring the same number
    of spring and fall soil samples as collected in this study to estimate ET is not
    practical for growers and their agronomists, although a few samples are reasonable
    [15]. Other methods of obtaining ET at the requisite spatial density are possible
    through remote sensing estimates, modeling, or the use of ancillary variables
    to delineate zones that reflect CWP variability [25,28,43]. The method of using
    CWP (yield and ET) did not capture all the variation within the field but coupling
    the zones created from CWP while utilizing the variation of VWC and FC from soil
    sensors to make in-season irrigation management decisions did play an important
    role in the entirety of the VRI process of irrigation management. This approach
    can improve spatial precision and accuracy of irrigation—potentially improving
    the crop and conserving water. 4.2. Cumulative Irrigation Events While irrigation
    rates within the zones may have been similar to each other at the beginning of
    the season, rates changed as plants matured, weather changed, and water levels
    decreased in soil profiles (Figure 4). This showed that less water was needed
    at different times of the season, and it was assumed that potential drainage or
    runoff was avoided within the irrigation zones. In addition to the difference
    in FC values among zones, the difference in water needs across zones could be
    described by areas that are more productive than others, resulting in higher water
    needs because ET increased in productive areas. The differences could also be
    from topography changes, even if they are slight within this field, and zones
    with slopes may see a dry down sooner than those with no slopes. For example,
    Zone 3 is situated on a ridge with a slope that moves toward Zone 2 (Figure 1).
    The VWC in Zone 3 did not reach FC after the irrigation events (Figure 4), and
    although there was no visible runoff, subterranean lateral water movement within
    the soil profile toward Zone 2 could have occurred. Zone 3 also shows historically
    lower yields compared to other parts of the field, which could affect the water
    needs as the plants are not as productive in this zone as other zones. Considering
    these aspects throughout each zone could be beneficial in understanding the individual
    water needs. Utilizing a sensor-based VRI management scheme resulted in a reduction
    in the number of irrigation events and the total water applied in each zone with
    no measurable negative impacts on yield. When the field was irrigated to FC within
    each zone, total water applied was reduced. Although the zones were irrigated
    at rates greater than the estimated GSP at different times within the growing
    season, this was performed (Figure 4) to avoid bringing the plants into a state
    of crop stress where yield is negatively affected. All zones showed lower cumulative
    irrigation compared to total estimated GSP, which resulted in water savings that
    are similar to other studies [11,14]. Managing VRI with zones that address the
    natural spatial variation of soil properties, such as FC, can result in water
    savings and has been noted to be valuable [18,25]. The project results suggest
    that using sensors to carefully monitor VWC and ensuring each zone was maintained
    at FC was successful at avoiding crop stress (Figure 3). The onset of crop water
    stress did occur in 21% of field locations in 2019; however, 79% did not reach
    that level of stress until the end of the season [44]. Indeed, by using this approach,
    stress was delayed well beyond the GST, starting around Day 174 (24 July) [4].
    Although methodology for an exact sensor location is still in process [32,45],
    using irrigation zones can increase water use efficiency and delay the onset of
    crop water stress leading to higher yield and water savings [11]. 4.3. Temporal
    Differences of VWC The VWC is affected by permanent soil properties, such as soil
    texture, SWHC, FC, and WP [7,9,18]. However, Baroni et al. [46] showed that soil
    properties alone do not account for all the spatiotemporal VWC variation. Topography,
    dynamic climate factors, variation in crop growth and ET, and other factors affect
    the variation of VWC throughout a field. This suggests that irrigation decisions
    should include input beyond VWC, such as leaf area index. Research has found that
    irrigating based on sensors placed in each VRI zone has resulted in water savings
    [11]. This study showed that irrigating unique rates, which varied on average
    by 10.8 mm among watering events, according to differences in soil properties
    among zones coupled with VWC sensors were valuable resources to apply the right
    amount of water in each zone. The water savings generated by a reduced application
    by an average of 12% due to VWC values gave the cooperating grower more water
    to apply to historically underwatered areas. Further, in the past, the area just
    west of the ridgeline (mainly in Zone 2) would be overwatered under uniform irrigation.
    This was a problem, especially during a potato crop, because the excess moisture
    would cause disease in that part of the field and decrease yields. The VWC sensor
    curves did not reach FC at each irrigation event potentially due to the buffering
    effect of the lower soil profile. The deeper depths of the soil profiles still
    contained water at the beginning of the season, but as the season progressed,
    and plants continued to grow and mature, those deeper profiles depleted more water
    throughout the season. This buffering effect is evident in the different zones.
    For example, the VWC in Zone 1 increased each time irrigation was applied, but
    Zone 2 did not respond in the same manner as the VWC would continue to decrease
    with irrigation events. Only after large amounts of irrigation were applied in
    July did the VWC in Zone 2 finally increase. The reasoning for this could have
    been that the lower soil profiles were eventually filled enough for the 0.30 m
    depth to also retain water. As irrigation events were watered to only the first
    soil’s depth (0.30 m) of FC, water continued to move downward and could have been
    taken up by deeper roots. This could explain why FC was not always reached after
    irrigation events. Although it would seem beneficial to water to multiple depths
    of FC values, these rates became too high for the center pivot to water as the
    growers’ pivot had a maximum rate of 29 mm per pass. In situ sensors provide temporal
    water status at static locations but do not provide information at spatial scales
    required for developing VRI zones [11]. Installing multiple sensors per field
    is cost prohibitive and increases VRI implementation costs [11]. Utilizing sensors
    in combination with satellite imagery may be an effective strategy to reduce the
    need for multiple sensors per field. For example, Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery
    was used to estimate soil moisture throughout the growing season [44], and Landsat
    satellite imagery was used to detect spatial variability of crop water stress
    [31]. These strategies could be used to assist in making sensor placement decisions.
    Understanding the spatial variability within each zone can assist growers not
    only in making sensor placement decisions and irrigation rate decisions but also
    in delineating VRI zones as they are cost efficient and provide spatially dense
    data. 5. Conclusions Delineating five VRI zones from historic yield and ET observations
    effectively reduced irrigation requirements in the field utilized in this study.
    Irrigation was further refined by implementing in situ VWC soil moisture sensors
    to inform spatially precise irrigation rates to conserve irrigation water. Utilizing
    the natural variation in soil properties among zones incorporated with zone-specific
    VWC soil sensors is a useful irrigation management practice to maintain VWC below
    FC and above RAW values in each zone, thus saving water and protecting the crop
    from the early onset of crop water stress. Although a statistical comparison could
    not be made, these methods presented the ability to conserve water and improve
    water use efficiency. Further work is required to find more accurate ways of delineating
    zones, identifying optimal sensor placement, and measuring spatial FC values in
    a cost-effective manner. Refining VRI zone delineation and decision support systems
    will improve water usage and conserve increasingly scarce water resources. Author

  description: Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is widely employed for various
    minimally invasive procedures, including treatment of tumors, cardiac arrhythmias
    and varicose veins. Accurate real-time monitoring of the ablation treatments remains
    challenging with the existing clinical imaging modalities due to the lack of spatial
    or temporal resolution or insufficient tissue contrast for differentiating thermal
    lesions. Optoacoustic (OA) imaging has been recently suggested for monitoring
    temperature field and lesion progression during RF interventions. However, strong
    light absorption by standard metallic catheters hindered practical implementations
    of this approach. Herein, we introduce a new RF ablation catheter concept for
    combined RF ablation and OA lesion monitoring. The catheter tip encapsulates a
    multimode fiber bundle for OA excitation with near-infrared (NIR) light, whereas
    the electric current is conducted through the irrigation solution, thus avoiding
    direct exposure of the metallic parts to the excitation light. We optimized the
    catheter diameter and the saline flow rate in order to attain uniform and deep
    lesions. The newly introduced hybrid catheter design was successfully tested by
    real-time monitoring of the ablation process in smooth ventricle and rough atrium
    walls of a blood-filled ex vivo porcine heart, mimicking in vivo conditions in
    the clinical setting.

    America Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is routinely used in a myriad of
    clinical interventions such as cancer therapy [1], endovenous removal of varicose
    veins [2,3], or treatment of cardiac disorders [4]. The procedure is generally
    preferred over alternative thermal ablation approaches due to its low cost, minimal
    invasiveness, and simplicity of operation [5]. Typically, RF ablation procedures
    are being performed under x-ray fluoroscopy guidance. However this offers poor
    soft tissue contrast, lacks three-dimensional (3D) information, and carries certain
    risks due to the long exposure to x-rays [6]. Moreover, success rates of RF catheter
    ablation procedures critically depend upon the effective tissue impedance in the
    heat-affected area and the resulting spatio-temporal distribution of the temperature
    field. Development of non-invasive real-time monitoring methods is hence essential
    for optimizing outcomes of these treatments. To this end, several imaging modalities
    have been suggested for this purpose [7–11]. However, these are either limited
    by lack of contrast and sensitivity, the use of ionizing radiation, shallow penetration,
    or insufficient spatio-temporal resolution [8,12]. Optoacoustic (OA) imaging has
    recently been proposed as a new approach for monitoring RF ablation procedures
    [13–17]. The method is based on tissue excitation with non-ionizing laser light
    and has shown considerable sensitivity to temperature changes and chemical transformations
    associated with tissue coagulation [14]. The temperature dependence of the OA
    signal intensity is associated with the Grüneisen parameter for temperatures below
    the coagulation threshold and becomes more complex at higher temperatures due
    to non-linear effects and additional changes of tissue optical properties [18].
    Moreover, state-of-the-art systems are capable of real-time imaging in two and
    three dimensions with high spatial resolution [19], which was explored for monitoring
    of various thermal therapy interventions [14,20,21]. 3D imaging systems are known
    to be less prone to quantification errors and further enable mapping the entire
    volume of the induced lesion. In particular, feasibility of 3D mapping of temperature
    distribution and lesion progression during RF ablation has been demonstrated [15],
    albeit the excitation light was delivered through the imaging probe, making it
    not practical for monitoring ablation treatments in deep human tissues like the
    atrial wall. We have recently introduced an integrated catheter design based on
    copper-coated fibers that enabled simultaneous delivery of the ablation current
    and NIR excitation light into the ablated region [16]. This forward-looking catheter
    enabled simultaneous delivery of the ablation current and the excitation laser
    light, yet significant image distortions were observed due to strong light absorption
    and acoustic reflections at the catheter tip. In this work, we introduce a new
    catheter design concept where the ablation current is delivered via the irrigation
    saline solution, thus averting direct exposure of any metallic parts to the excitation
    laser light (Fig. 1). The latter is provided via five multimode fibers encapsulated
    in the catheter tip. The step-index multimode fibers (Thorlabs, USA) have a core
    diameter of 600 μm and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.50. The catheter is further
    composed of a T-type thermocouple and a metallic 23G×3 1/ 8 ′′ needle (Sterican,
    B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) that functions as an ablation electrode and a
    passage for the saline irrigation [Fig. 1(b)]. The proximal end of the catheter
    features separate connectors to the RF signal generator, Maestro 3000, (Boston
    Scientific, Marlborough, USA), data acquisition card, NI 9213 DAQ, for temperature
    recordings [National Instruments Corporation, Texas, USA)], syringe pump for continuous
    saline irrigation (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA), and a tunable
    nanosecond laser source for the OA excitation (Innolas Laser GmbH, Krailling,
    Germany). Fig. 1. Design and implementation of the RF ablation catheter. (a) Schematic

    Full Size | PDF The fibers were bundled within an optical fiber connector, stabilized
    using a high-temperature epoxy (353ND, Epoxy Technology, Inc. Billerica, Mass.,
    USA), and polished to achieve optimal coupling to the outlet of the laser. At
    the distal end of the RF catheter, multimode fibers were cleaved to achieve maximum
    efficiency and arranged around the ablation electrode to fit within a 5 mm long
    (3 mm diameter) glass tubing (Bruker, Massachusetts, USA) [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)].
    Saline injection with a syringe pump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA)
    is canalized to the ablation electrode through a fine bore polythene tubing with
    0.86 mm inner diameter (Smiths Medical Inc., Minnesota, USA). A high-density thermocouple
    module (National Instruments, Austin, USA) further enables temperature readings
    during RF ablation with a T-type thermocouple attached to the outer surface of
    the catheter [Fig. 1(b)]. The illumination pattern at the tissue surface was characterized
    by imaging a microscope slide painted in black with the OA system. The top-view
    of the 3D OA image is displayed in Fig. 1(d). The measured pulse energy at the
    output of the fiber bundle was 2 mJ distributed over an 8 mm 2 area on the tissue
    surface, which corresponds to a fluence of 25 mJ/cm 2 , within the ANSI safety
    standard at 780 nm wavelength [22]. The light intensity is then expected to decay
    approximately one order of magnitude per centimeter within biological tissues
    at NIR wavelengths [23]. OA monitoring of the RF ablation procedure was performed
    by collecting the signals generated in the illuminated tissue volume with a custom-made
    spherical matrix ultrasound detector array having 256 detection elements with
    central frequency of 4 MHz and 100% detection bandwidth, allowing for almost isotropic
    resolution of ∼200  μm at the center of the sphere [24]. The ultrasound array
    was placed from the side of the heart opposite to the catheter [Fig. 1(a)] and
    filled with agar to ensure acoustic coupling between the heart tissue and detection
    elements. A custom-made data acquisition system (DAQ, Falkenstein Mikrosysteme
    GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) was used to digitize the generated OA signals at 40
    mega-samples per second, being triggered by the Q-switch output of the OPO laser.
    The OA signals acquired during the RF ablation experiments were band-pass filtered
    with cutoff frequencies 0.1 and 3 MHz and processed with a model-based reconstruction
    algorithm to render 3D images of the ROI [25]. The reconstructed images were further
    corrected for the exponential light fluence decay in the axial direction. The
    RF ablation efficiency of the endocardial irrigated catheter was evaluated by
    characterizing the lesions created with varying ablation parameters. Specifically,
    the coagulation depth was measured by manually segmenting the cross-sectional
    photographs taken after the procedure [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] as a function of the
    saline concentration, ablation duration, irrigation rate, and the diameter of
    the catheter tip. RF ablation lesion characterization experiments were performed
    using freshly excised porcine heart tissues placed on top of a conductive grounding
    pad that served as a ground electrode. The distal end of the RF ablation catheter
    (3 mm tip diameter) was placed on the heart samples, while its proximal end was
    connected to an RF generator delivering 20 kHz frequency electric signals with
    an average power of 10 W. Ablation lesion formation was accomplished by transmitting
    electrical current through different samples of heart tissue for 10, 30, 60, 90,
    120, 240, and 300 s. Fig. 2. Dependence of the lesion depth (mm) upon ablation
    time. (a) Lesions formed by 0.9% saline solution with different irrigation rates.
    (b) The corresponding lesions formed by 3.6% saline solution. The photographs
    from sliced specimen show representative examples of the ablation lesions formed
    by irrigating saline with (a) 6 ml/min for 30 s and (b) with 9 ml/min irrigation
    rate for 240 s. Download Full Size | PDF Same experiments were repeated by irrigating
    the 0.9% (physiological) and 3.6% (hypertonic) saline solutions which were prepared
    by pouring 9 and 36 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), respectively, to one liter of
    distilled water and mixing it until the solution becomes transparent. The effect
    of the saline irrigation rate on lesion formation was evaluated for 1, 3, 6, and
    9 ml/min irrigation rates using the syringe pump flow rate control. Figures 2(a)
    and 2(b) display the lesion depth (mm) versus ablation time (s) for different
    saline solution concentrations (%) and irrigation rates (ml/min). The location
    of the endocardial catheter during the characterization experiments is indicated
    with a black arrow in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Clearly, deeper lesions are generated
    by higher saline concentrations. Overall, mean ablation depths attained for 0.9%
    saline concentration was 4 mm, while it increased to 5.5 mm for 3.6% saline concentration.
    The maximum lesion depth achieved with 0.9% saline concentration at a 9 ml/min
    saline flow rate was 6 mm, while 9 mm lesions were generated with 3.6% saline
    concentration at a 6 ml/min saline flow rate. We observed that the lesion progressed
    gradually within the first 120 s, while no significant changes were noticed between
    120 and 240 s. The saline concentration and the flow rate affect the electrical
    conductivity and hence are expected to have an effect on the formed lesion. High
    saline irrigation rates have an additional cooling effect that prevents excessive
    heating and decreases the possibility of tissue charring. The influence of these
    effects is however difficult to quantify, and we did not observe a clear dependence
    of the lesion depth upon the flow rate of the saline solution. In a different
    set of experiments, dependence of the lesion depth upon the catheter tip diameter
    has been examined. Here we kept the saline concentration and the irrigation rate
    at 0.9% and 9 ml/min, respectively, and RF ablation was maintained for 300 s.
    As expected, the observed lesion depths increase from 3.5 mm to 6.5 mm when increasing
    the catheter diameter from 2 to 4 mm. Note, however, that clinical RF ablation
    catheters normally measure 5–8 French (1.66–2.66 mm) to prevent vessel damage
    during the catheterization procedure. Since the 2 mm catheter was only capable
    of creating superficial lesions, the 3 mm catheter tip was selected for the final
    design due to its consistent ablation performance and relatively small size. In
    the first OA monitoring experiment, we evaluated the feasibility of imaging a
    tissue sample under a realistic in vivo imaging scenario with the highly absorbing
    blood background. We therefore mimicked a typical cardiac or endovenous procedure
    by inserting the RF catheter in a plastic chamber filled with fresh porcine blood,
    which is meant to be removed by irrigating the saline solution. OA imaging at
    780 nm (isosbestic point of hemoglobin) was then performed during irrigation of
    the saline. In the resulting images, the bright OA signal in the beginning of
    the procedure [Fig. 3(a)] originates from blood in contact with the tip of the
    fiber bundle (pre-irrigation). As the irrigation progresses, the blood is slowly
    removed from the catheter tip with a mixture of blood and saline remaining in
    the cavity so that more light can propagate toward the catheter edge. As a result,
    both tips of the fiber bundle and the catheter turn visible [Fig. 3(b)]. The gradual
    irrigation effects can be best perceived in Visualization 1 showing real-time
    evolution of the OA images. The images mainly feature the edges between regions
    with different blood concentration, which is ascribed to the limited angular coverage
    of the transducer array and the associated limited-view image artifacts [26].
    At a later stage (post-irrigation), all the blood is removed from the catheter
    tip, making it transparent for the light delivery. This results in bright signals
    from the blood interface surrounding the catheter tip [Fig. 3(c)]. Each step during
    the perfusion of the saline is further schematically represented in Figs. 3(d)–3(f).
    The experimental arrangement of the OA imaging system relative to the endocardial
    catheter, placed in direct contact with the blood-filled chamber, is shown in
    Fig. 3(g). The field of view in panels a-c corresponds to the blood volume represented
    in Fig. 3(g). Fig. 3. Real-time OA imaging of saline irrigation in the course

    | PDF In the second experiment, real-time OA monitoring of RF ablation progression
    was performed in an in vivo porcine heart filled with blood to mimic typical conditions
    in a clinical setting. Both the heart ventricle and atrium were ablated by employing
    the same RF generator parameters as described in the characterization experiments.
    Throughout the ablation procedure, 3.6% saline solution was irrigated at 1 ml/min
    rate. The laser wavelength was set to 780 nm, corresponding to the maximum OA
    contrast achieved between coagulated and non-coagulated tissues [15]. OA signals
    were then acquired for 200 s, including 20 s before the RF generator was activated,
    100 s during the ablation procedure, and 80 s during the cool-down phase. It was
    observed that larger and deeper lesions were produced on the smooth ventricular
    wall while electric contact was presumably compromised by the rough atrial surface.
    A clear increase of the OA signal in the in vivo porcine ventricle tissue was
    perceived in the entire ROI while the signal intensity was lowest prior to the
    activation of the RF energy [Figs. 4(a)–4(c)]. This is partially attributed to
    the changes in the Grüneisen parameter caused by temperature increase due to resistive
    heating of the heart muscle [14]. The OA signal is additionally altered by tissue
    coagulation [27]. Overall, the ablated region in the sliced specimen [Fig. 4(d)]
    corresponds well to the shape of the yellow-colored area exhibiting elevated OA
    signal in the post-ablation OA image in Fig. 4(c). The temporal evolution of the
    OA readings in two representative voxels is further shown in Fig. 4(e). The OA
    signal at the end of the acquisition is higher than in the pre-ablation region,
    due to continuing cooldown. Also, the signal in the coagulated area [purple square
    in Fig. 4(c)] did not decrease significantly during the cool-down phase [purple
    plot in Fig. 4(e)]; this could be mainly attributed to an increase in the optical
    absorption coefficient caused by the denaturized proteins in this region [18].

    devised a new approach for real-time OA monitoring of thermal lesion formation
    during RF ablation treatments. Owing to the indirect transmission of the RF current
    into the tissue through the irrigation saline solution, image artefacts associated
    with light absorption by metallic components or acoustic reflections at the catheter
    tip can be avoided. Active cooling provided by irrigated catheters is in fact
    an established method implemented in clinical cardiac RF ablation procedures that
    has been shown to increase efficiency of the lesion generation and reduce the
    risk of tissue charring and steam pops [28]. In the ex vivo porcine heart ablation
    experiments, different chambers of the heart were successfully ablated providing
    uniform coagulum without any tissue charring, while the OA signal variations associated
    with the temperature increase and chemical transformations during coagulation
    could be monitored in real-time. In general, the lesions developed in the atrium
    were shallower than those developed in the ventricle. This can be attributed to
    the more heterogeneous structure of the atrium wall and the compositional differences
    between two chambers. However, the fact that coagulation could still be produced
    under this challenging scenario indicates the general usability of the catheter
    for real clinical application. Design optimizations may still result in a better
    performance on rough surfaces. Also important is the fact that relatively deep
    ablation lesions could be produced in calibration experiments for a relatively
    small catheter diameter as well as low saline concentrations and irrigation rates.
    Minimal irrigation rates were dispensed in all ablation experiments. In this way,
    potential damages, such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion, can be avoided,
    even when using hypertonic saline concentrations. The lesion depths achieved in
    most of our experiments may, however, not suffice for some cardiac RF ablation
    procedures, such that larger catheter diameters would be deemed necessary. The
    reason for shallow ablation lesions can be explained by tissue heterogeneities,
    which lead to sub-optimal catheter-tissue contact and the need to apply force
    to guarantee good coupling. A certain degree of pressure is required for controlled
    ablation, which is crucial for averting damage to the neighboring healthy tissue
    and the risk of cardiac tamponade [29]. The endocardial catheter may also be a
    useful tool in anticoagulation therapy [30]. The ablation performance can also
    be enhanced by incorporating a force feedback from the catheter in future catheter
    designs as different risk levels of cardiac perforation are imposed by atria and
    ventricles due to their different wall thickness [31]. Funding Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

  description: This research was conducted in the central pivot of the Colegio de
    Postgraduados, Mexico, Montecillo campus from 2011 to 2012. The objective was
    to design, build and evaluate a precision irrigation system operating on a central
    pivot. The methodology was quartered 1) development of electromechanical component,
    based on the location of the system, cabling and installation of valves; 2) electronic
    component, with the development of two tablets, GPS integration and communication
    with the computer; 3) software based on the comparison of the data obtained by
    the GPS with a map set zones "homogeneous" for irrigation, and 4) evaluation of
    the system by comparing the amount of water applied (ordered by the program) and
    the water collected at ground level. Among the results was a) the precision irrigation
    system in the central pivot, which allows the operation of valves according to
    position; b) development of a precision irrigation software open and adaptable
    to any equipment bearing circular (central pivot) at any location on earth, by
    any standard programming or cultivation soil variability; c) evaluation of the
    precision was found to allow a saving irrigation of water 39.09% compared to uniform
    application achieved with the use of a conventional irrigation pivot and variation
    between the applied and collected sheet of 8.41% was attributed to wind and delay
    in valve actuation operating conditions under study.

  description: GNSS-controlled land leveling system is complicated to operate and
    farmland measuring is time-consuming, in order to solve these problems, this paper
    aimed at developing a fast GNSS-controlled land leveling system. The system including
    the core processing platform, GNSS signal receiving device and hydraulic. The
    system can achieve the fast farmland reference design, graphic land leveling,
    slope land leveling; the farmland reference design meant real-time correction
    calculation of the reference plane prior operation and in operation without farmland
    measuring, which increased the accuracy; the algorithm of slope land design was
    optimized based on the early stage of the system algorithm, and the slope land
    leveling algorithm applied to the fast GNSS-controlled land leveling system was
    proposed. Since this system can work without farmland measuring, it can be applied
    to the paddy field leveling which couldn't be measured. After slope leveling,
    it can achieve the fast irrigation water and the uniform water coverage, reduce
    the amount of cutting and filling soil as well as improve the leveling speed.
    Long-term experiment was done to test the system and results showed that after
    the graphic leveling, the maximum elevation difference was decreased from 18.9
    cm to 8.1 cm, elevation standard deviation was decreased from 11.2 cm to 5.5 cm,
    the average land leveling measuring point error was less than 5 cm, and the cumulative
    percentage rose from 75.693% to 90.674%. After slope leveling, the actual farmland
    slope was similar to the designed slope, leveling speed was fast and leveling
    effect was good.

  description: In sprinkling irrigation, evaluation of spraying quality mainly depends
    on water distribution test systems. Commonly, there are at least dozens of test
    points needed in the water distribution test, and sometimes hundreds of them are
    used in some particular cases. The space between rain gauges ranges from 0.5 m
    to 2 m by the coverage diameter of sprinkler which commonly requires high mobility
    and convenient reading functions. Traditionally, the test requires measurements
    of hundreds of points by use of standard measuring cup. Following that, a great
    deal of data from the test cups are collected for the calculation of sprinkler
    irrigation uniformity, and then water distribution map were manually drawn. All
    of those bring problems like heavy workload or low precision of the measured results.
    The water distribution testing software implemented can be used to draw the map
    of water distribution or the calculation, but it may not realize the function
    of real-time plot with the separation of water collecting apparatus. Moreover,
    the data downloaded into computer from the measuring apparatus cannot be exported
    to Excel, which may cause errors. Moreover, the drawings of water distribution
    map can only be printed in a specified angle and the outline of the water distribution
    cannot be viewed in a time. In order to improve the sprinkler performance and
    optimize the water distribution, a new approach of using wireless to test water
    distribution of sprinkler was proposed based on ZigBee technology, a new short-distance
    wireless network standard for sensor network with the distinct advantages of low
    energy consumption, low latency, and long battery lives, and Matlab in the double
    tipping bucket rain gauge, in which a wireless module ZigBee, and a hall sensor
    were installed to receive and store signal generated by the tipping bucket rain
    acquisition parts by CC2530 module. The rain gauges were arranged in the test
    field in a rectangular and radial direction and each one was numbered uniquely
    in the entire network. The frequency of communication between receiver and upper
    computer was 2.4GHz. In order to avoid signal congestion, the number of routing
    nodes was enlarged and tree type networks were used in the rain gauges. Terminal
    nodes were responsible for collecting signal and delivering it to the routing
    nodes during working conditions and the routing nodes transmitted the signal to
    the coordinators. The ZigBee coordinator node received signal and delivered it
    to the upper computer in which a real-time analytic software was developed by
    graphical user interfaces (GUI) of Matlab. The software allowed us to analyze
    data precisely with intuitive three-dimension image. The new developed test system
    had distinct advantage like improved generality, easy expansibility, high reliability
    and interoperability compared to the traditional one. A water distribution test
    was conducted as to the S800 rotating sprinkler produced by the Toro Company.
    The error of this system and manual measurement was less than 0.1 mm/h. It can
    bear at least 2940 reversal per hour without leak. The software system calculated
    11 combination sprinkler irrigation Christiansen uniformity coefficients with
    the combination spacing coefficient ranged from 1.0 to 2.0. The test results showed
    that the Christiansen uniformity coefficients of sprinkler reached 70.6%. The
    Christiansen uniformity coefficients corresponding to the combination spacing
    coefficient of rectangle ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 and that of triangle range from
    1.0 to 1.2 or 1.5 to 1.7 were up to 75%, which met the expected requirements.
    The entire system provided reliable data collection method and functional data
    analysis software for researcher to develop new sprinklers.

  description: 'Precise land leveling of farmlands is an important foundation of modern
    ground irrigation system. It can improve the uniformity of irrigation as well
    as soil water and salt distribution, thus controlling weeds, saving water and
    increasing yield. The application of GNSS (global navigation satellite system)-controlled
    land leveling technology is protected from weather. Besides, it has high speed
    and working efficiency, which earns broad application prospects. Combined with
    the actual situation of land leveling in China as well as the early research work,
    based on GNSS-controlled land leveling technology, the paper developed a leveling
    system which is suitable for China. The system reduces the cost of equipment and
    optimizes its leveling function. To reduce the number of discrete devices and
    improve system integration, the paper designed an integrated control terminal,
    including an integrated GNSS receiver module, a differential radio module, a core
    processing platform and a valve control module. The paper also designed the outer
    covering of integrated control terminal. It can be rotated to adjust the bracket
    through the tractor cab, and it is protected from dust, making it convenient to
    operate. To optimize topographic survey, the paper acquired more terrain information,
    for instance, the area of farmlands, which guides the later leveling operations.
    It also adds function of real-time display of measurement tracks. What''s more,
    it optimizes the reference design to achieve any grade slope leveling by building
    a mathematic model and solve it. The optimized system consists of integrated intelligent
    control terminals, independent differential GNSS receiver module, hydraulic system
    and flat shovel equipment. Meanwhile, based on Visual Studio 2008 as the development
    environment, the integrated software helps a lot to land leveling. The software
    has accomplished the function of topographic survey, reference design and leveling
    operation. The intelligent precise leveling system has been applied for long experiment
    on Shang Zhuang experimental station of China Agricultural University. The accuracy
    of the system is encouraging: the maximum elevation difference after the plane
    leveling goes down from 20.9 cm to 10 cm and height standard deviation of elevation
    drops from 10.6 cm to 5.5 cm; the cumulative percentage, of which the accuracy
    errors are less than 5 cm, is increased from 77% to 90% after the land leveling.
    Besides, flat slope gradient goes down from 0.239% to 0.120%, which is in line
    with the design requirements. The results showed that the system is stable and
    reliable for operation and it perfectly meets the requirements of precise land
    leveling. The system developed in this paper is suitable for our farmland and
    farm equipment with abundant function and is easy to operate while the cost is
    reduced by more than a half compared with the similar foreign advanced products.
    It will help as fine irrigation and water-saving equipment in China and it will
    earn large-scale application in our country.'

    The process of bone healing around dental implants and osseointegration is a complex
    repair mechanism of the organism usually resulting in structural contact between
    bone and implant surface (Lang et al. 2011; Terheyden et al. 2011). Numerous investigations
    have evaluated the factors potentially affecting osseointegration to establish
    this intimate bone–implant contact and to prevent early implant failure, although
    the etiopathogenesis of an early implant loss has not yet been fully clarified.
    It has been reported that absence of bacterial contamination, sufficient initial
    primary stability and gentle surgical preparation technique are among the predominant
    factors for avoiding the formation of a connective tissue layer between the tissue–implant
    interface and ensuring appropriate bone healing (Branemark et al. 1977; Albrektsson
    et al. 1981; Esposito et al. 1998; Dereka et al. 2011). During recent decades,
    various in vivo and in vitro investigations were focused on mechanical and thermal
    injuries during bone osteotomies that may compromise the healing processes and
    lead to implant failures (Tehemar 1999). Generally, it has been determined that
    a critical temperature threshold value of 44 to 47°C for only 1 min leads to heat-induced
    bone necrosis and that a temperature threshold of 50°C for 1 min induces impaired
    bone regeneration resulting in bone resorption of up to 20% (Lundskog 1972; Eriksson
    & Albrektsson 1983; Esposito et al. 1998; Tehemar 1999; Chacon et al. 2006; Yoshida
    et al. 2009). For avoiding dental implant failures due to mechanical and thermal
    injuries, previ-ous well-documented investigations also described the factors
    potentially affecting osseointegration, including different drilling parameters
    such as drilling speed, depth, load and conventional vs. alternative drilling
    (e.g. bone condensing, ultrasonic and laser osteotomy), different drill modifications
    regarding drill design, geometry, sharpness and materials (e.g. stainless steel
    vs. ceramic drills) and various irrigation techniques (external/internal/combined
    irrigation) (Tehemar 1999; Jochum & Reichart 2000; Benington et al. 2002; Ercoli
    et al. 2004; Sener et al. 2009; Stübinger et al. 2010; Mišić et al. 2011; Oh et
    al. 2011; Rashad et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2012; Strbac et al. 2012). However,
    most of the previously published studies investigating these mechanical and thermal
    factors were performed on a huge variety of in vivo and in vitro bone specimens,
    with a dissimilar relationship between cortical and cancellous bone and a different
    thermal conductivity compared with clinical conditions in human bone. In addition,
    temperature changes were mainly recorded with single thermocouples or infrared
    thermography with low thermal sensitivity and with subsequent measurements, which
    could mostly focus on superficial cortical bone areas disregarding the heat generation
    in the deeper cancellous bone and thus leading to controversial outcomes for different
    irrigation methods due to varying results (Abouzgia & James 1997; Tehemar 1999;
    Benington et al. 2002; Sener et al. 2009). To overcome these limitations and considering
    the fact that temperature generation does also depend on the bone osteotomy site,
    artificial bone specimens were introduced for temperature measurements regarding
    implant drill modifications, so as to provide a uniform testing model simulating
    equivalent bone density (Oh et al. 2011). These established specimens of polyurethane
    origin have been widely used for implant testing evaluating different surgical
    techniques and implant surface modifications with regard to primary implant stability
    (Hägi et al. 2010; Tabassum et al. 2010). Although these artificial bone blocks
    provide solid properties for mechanical assessment, recent investigations introduced
    artificial organic bone analogues of bovine origin that additionally provide a
    uniform relationship between cortical and cancellous bone, for the purpose of
    testing primary stability of temporary orthodontic implants (Migliorati et al.
    2012). Because of this unique structural morphology with respect to homogenous
    cortical and cancellous areas, these novel artificial organic bone specimens can
    also provide consistent thermal conductivity similar to that of human bone making
    them preferable for further investigations involving temperature measurements
    during implant osteotomies (Clattenburg et al. 1975; Davidson & James 2000). The
    aim of this investigation was to evaluate the thermal effects and differences
    of mandatory irrigation methods (without/external/internal/combined) on a novel
    standardized artificial organic bone specimen as determined by multichannel real-time
    measurements at different tissue depths, during a reproducible automated intermittent
    drilling procedure. As literature on irrigation methods shows controversial outcomes
    concerning their beneficial effects in heat reduction, the present investigation
    is analyzing previous outcomes on a standardized testing model of bovine origin
    ensuring a uniform relationship of cortical and cancellous bone and analogous
    thermal conductivity comparable with that of human bone. Material and methods
    Bone specimen In the present investigation, drilling osteotomies were performed
    on artificially manufactured bovine bone specimens (BoneSim™, 1800.35/1300.14
    Composite; BoneSim™, Newaygo, MI, USA) providing equal vertical (3 mm cortical
    bone/15 mm cancellous bone) and horizontal (diameter 58 mm) parameters (Figs 1
    and 2), to simulate clinical conditions in human bone (type 2 according to Lekholm
    and Zarb classification) and to standardize bone density and the ratio between
    cortical and cancellous bone (Lekholm & Zarb 1985). Moreover, to ensure comparable
    temperature changes equivalent to those in human bone, this organic bone specimen
    of bovine origin provides analogous thermal conductivity of 0.3–0.4 W/m/K (Clattenburg
    et al. 1975; Davidson & James 2000; Sener et al. 2009). To ensure a stable base
    during drilling procedures, each bone specimen was embedded in a clear rectangular
    polystyrene test box (No. 34160-0101; Bock, Lauterbach, Germany) using auto-polymerizing
    acrylic resin (SR Ivolen®; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) (Benington
    et al. 2002; Strbac et al. 2012) (Fig. 3). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    measurement Two custom-built multichannel thermoprobes (SHT-Thermoprobe; Center
    for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna,
    Vienna, Austria), with a diameter of 1.5 mm and a length of 18 mm, were constructed
    using a computer-aided design (CAD) software (NX 5.0.3.2 Unigraphics; PLM Software,
    Siemens™, Cologne, Germany) and printed with a medically approved material (Objet
    FullCure720™; Objet Ltd., Rehovot, Israel) by a rapid prototyping system (Eden350™;
    Objet Ltd., Rehovot, Israel). Each thermoprobe was equipped with 7 NTC type temperature
    sensors (Miniature Axial Glass Thermistor, No. GA10KM3499J15; Measurement Specialties™,
    Hampton, VA, USA; NTC sensor = negative temperature coefficient temperature sensor,
    electrical resistance 10 KΩ at 25°C, diameter 0.4 mm, temperature range −40°C
    to +250°C, response time <0.2 s), for real-time temperature measurements at defined
    measuring depths (2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16 mm) (Fig. 4). The temperature sensors
    (in total n = 14), which were precalibrated against traceable standards ranging
    from 5 to 100°C, recorded temperature changes during drilling with a computer-aided
    system (SHTM-Temperature Measurement System; Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical
    Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) and a software-controlled
    program (DASYLab® Software 5.0; Measurement Computing Corporation, Norton, MA,

    Experimental set-up Implant site preparations were performed by the aid of a computer-aided
    surgical system (SH-Surgical Drilling-Sequence-Simulator System; Center for Medical
    Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria)
    developed for this purpose. This surgical device was composed of a computer-aided
    multiphase motor, which – aided by a software-controlled program (SSH-Surgical
    Drilling-Sequence-Controller Software 1.0; Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical
    Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) – ensured reproducible
    intermittent dislocations of the surgical handpiece (WS-75 E/KM 20:1; W&H, Bürmoos,
    Austria) (Figs 5 and 6). The software-controlled program provided a constant processing
    time, including intermittent implant drilling and withdrawal, for both drilling
    depths of 10 mm (27.6 s) and 16 mm (43.5 s) studied. Constant irrigation and drilling
    was performed by the surgical handpiece, which was connected to a surgical motor
    unit (Implantmed SI-923, Surgical Control S-N1; W&H), ensuring a constant drilling
    speed of 800 r.p.m. (Oliveira et al. 2012; Strbac et al. 2012). Figure 5 Open

    with a twist drill. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Automated intermittent
    and graduated drilling sequence (e.g. 3.5 mm conical implant drill, drilling depth
    10 mm and external saline irrigation) with inserted thermoprobes (SHT 1-Thermoprobe,
    SHT 2-Thermoprobe) after injection of heat-transfer compound to ensure a constant
    heat transfer. Operational procedure The artificial bovine bone specimens were
    secured in a computer-milled table of the surgical device and before each investigated
    drilling sequence, a precise dislocation of the table and a parallel preparation
    for the insertion of the two thermoprobes were performed with a twist drill (2
    mm ∅, 18 mm drilling depth, 210L20.205.020; Komet®, Gebr. Brasseler, Lemgo, Germany)
    at a predetermined distance of 1 and 2 mm to the final drill osteotomy (Jochum
    & Reichart 2000; Rashad et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2012; Strbac et al. 2012)
    (Figs 4 and 5). In addition, prior to each drilling sequence, a heat-transfer
    compound (HTCP20S 20 ml; Electrolube®, Leicestershire, UK) was injected into each
    thermoprobe canal before insertion of the thermoprobes to ensure a constant heat
    transfer from the bone to the temperature sensors during drilling (Jochum & Reichart
    2000; Ercoli et al. 2004; Rashad et al. 2011; Strbac et al. 2012). The automated
    intermittent and graduated drilling sequences were performed using surgical twist
    drills of 2 mm ∅ and conical implant drills of 3.5, 4.3 and 5 mm ∅ (NobelReplace™
    Tapered Drills; Nobel Biocare®, Gothenburg, Sweden) (Fig. 6). Every surgical drill
    was used only once to avoid any possible influence of drill wear with respect
    to temperature rise. For each diameter, two different drilling depths of 10 and
    16 mm were evaluated regarding different irrigation methods (without/external/internal/combined)
    with constant 50 ml/min isotonic saline solution (Viaflo, 0.9% NaCl, 1000 ml;
    Baxter Healthcare, Vienna, Austria) at room temperature (21 ± 1°C). The supply
    of the coolants was performed by an irrigation tubing set (Hose set for machinery−80
    mm; Omni®, Fidenza, Italy), connected to the surgical handpiece. Each artificial
    bovine specimen (n = 80) was randomly divided and perforated four times with a
    different irrigation method each time, to avoid any bias due to potentially varying
    bone densities (Mišić et al. 2011; Marković et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2012;
    Strbac et al. 2012). Every drilling procedure was conducted with 10 repetitions,
    in a total of 320 osteotomies, 80 for each diameter, 160 for each length and 80
    for each irrigation method. Statistical analysis The variation of temperature
    was calculated and compared by subtracting the recorded temperature [Tx] with
    the bone specimen baseline temperature [T0] before each osteotomy [ΔT(ºC) = Tx–T0]
    (Rashad et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2012; Strbac et al. 2012). A custom analysis
    software program (Temperature-Analysis; Department of Radiology, Medical University
    of Vienna, Austria), built on a computing software program (MATLAB®, R2011a; MathWorks®,
    Natick, MA, USA), was used to process the data. For analysis of the various irrigation
    methods, drill diameters and drilling depths, the mean of all temperature sensor
    locations (in total n = 14) per implant drill was used. In addition, a linear
    mixed model was estimated, which included the three factors (drilling depth, drilling
    diameter and irrigation method) and their interactions. The four drill holes per
    bone specimen were used for the four irrigation methods (without/external/internal/combined).
    Thus, bone specimens were used as underlying subjects and irrigation methods represent
    the repeated factor, assuming a compound symmetry variance–covariance matrix for
    the analysis. Heterogeneous variance estimations in subgroups were allowed to
    account for severe heterogeneity and a Kenward–Roger adjustment to the degrees
    of freedom was applied. Normal distribution of standardized residuals was verified
    graphically. As the three-way interaction was highly significant, subgroup analyses
    were performed by comparison of least-square means within the linear mixed model.
    Effects were described by back-transformed least-square means (LSM) and corresponding
    95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and data were graphically described by boxplots.
    Statistical calculations were performed with the statistical software SAS® (Version
    9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All P-values are two-sided and P ≤ 0.05
    was considered statistically significant. Results Temperature increases during
    implant site preparation with different irrigation methods, drilling depths and
    various implant drills were investigated by the evaluation of 320 drilling sequences.
    For each osteotomy, the temperature probe (SHT 1-Thermoprobe; 7 thermosensors/probe)
    located at a parallel vertical distance of 1 mm to the investigated osteotomy
    recorded a significantly higher temperature rise (P < 0.0001) in each predetermined
    superficial cortical and deeper cancellous bone area compared with the temperature
    probe (SHT 2-Thermoprobe; 7 thermosensors/probe) located at a vertical distance
    of 2 mm to the examined osteotomy. The organic bone specimens'' baseline temperature
    [T0] prior to each 10 mm depth osteotomy sequence was 21.53 ± 1.43°C and prior
    to each 16 mm depth osteotomy sequence 21.46 ± 1.35°C. The distributions of mean
    differences between drilling and baseline temperatures over the defined 14 temperature
    sensors are shown in Fig. 7a–d. The linear mixed model detected a significant
    three-way interaction between drilling depths, drill diameter and irrigation methods
    (P < 0.0001), consequently subgroups were described and tested. Figure 7 Open

    The highest mean temperature increase [ΔT°C LSM (95% CI)] during osteotomies (Table
    1) was observed without any coolant irrigation with 29.87°C (27.94; 31.80), followed
    by the generally used external irrigation with 28.47°C (26.58; 30.35), then the
    internal irrigation with 25.86°C (23.89; 27.83) and with nearly identical value

    sequences without irrigation The maximum temperature increase [ΔT] without saline
    irrigation for drilling depths of 10 mm was 13.89°C with conical implant drills
    of 3.5 mm diameter and for drilling depths of 16 mm 29.87°C with 2 mm diameter
    twist drills (Table 1). Drilling sequences with external irrigation The highest
    temperature change [ΔT] determined with constant external saline irrigation (21
    ± 1°C) for drilling depths of 10 mm was 9.55°C and for drilling depths of 16 mm
    28.47°C, in both cases using 2 mm diameter twist drills (Table 1). Drilling sequences
    with internal irrigation The greatest temperature increase [ΔT] recorded with
    constant internal saline irrigation (21 ± 1°C) for 10 mm drilling depths was 12.32°C
    and for 16 mm drilling depths 25.86°C with 2 mm diameter twist drills (Table 1).
    Drilling sequences with combined external and internal irrigation The highest
    temperature increase [ΔT] during drilling with constant combined saline irrigation
    (21 ± 1°C) was 13.57°C, recorded with 2 mm diameter twist drills and 10 mm drilling
    depths. For 16 mm drilling depths, the temperature increase was 25.68°C with 2
    mm diameter twist drills (Table 1). Temperature increase regarding various drilling
    depths (10/16 mm) For all irrigation methods studied, significant differences
    (P ≤ 0.0156 for all subgroups) between drilling depths of 10 and 16 mm regarding
    temperature increase [ΔT] could be observed when using twist drills of 2 mm diameter
    and conical implant drills of 3.5, 4.3 and 5 mm diameter (Table 1). Temperature
    increase regarding different implant drills (twist/conical drills) with various
    diameters (2/3.5/4.3/5 mm) Twist drills During implant osteotomies of 10 mm depths
    without irrigation, significant differences (P < 0.001) could be observed between
    twist drills of 2 mm diameter and conical implant drills of 4.3 and 5 mm diameter.
    When using irrigation, a positive association (P < 0.0001) was found between twist
    drills of 2 mm diameter and conical implant drills of 3.5, 4.3 and 5 mm diameter,
    respectively. Implant osteotomies of 16 mm depths revealed significant differences
    (P < 0.006) between twist drills of 2 mm diameter and conical implant drills of
    3.5, 4.3 and 5 mm diameter for all irrigation methods studied (Table 2). Conical
    implant drills Conical implant drills of 3.5 mm showed a significantly higher
    temperature increase (P < 0.02) compared with 4.3 or 5 mm diameter implant drills
    for all irrigation methods used and for both drilling depths (Table 2). Temperature
    variations of different irrigation methods regarding drilling depth and implant
    drills During implant sequences for drilling depths of 10 and 16 mm, significantly
    higher temperature differences (P < 0.0001) were recorded without irrigation compared
    with those with irrigation (external/internal/combined) when using conical implant
    drills of various diameter (3.5/4.3/5 mm) (Figs 7a–d, Table 3). Drilling osteotomies
    of 10 mm depth The highest temperature increase during 10 mm drilling sequences
    was recorded with combined irrigation during 2 mm twist drill osteotomies and
    with external irrigation during conical implant drill preparation of 3.5, 4.3
    and 5 mm compared with the other irrigation methods. The lowest temperature increase
    at all measuring points during 10 mm drilling osteotomies was observed with the
    use of 2 mm twist drills with external irrigation (P < 0.01 as compared with internal
    and combined irrigation), 3.5 mm conical drills with internal irrigation compared
    with an external cooling (P = 0.0165) and 4.3 mm conical drills with the use of
    a combined irrigation (P < 0.03 as compared to external and internal irrigations)
    (Figs 7a–d, Table 3). Drilling osteotomies of 16 mm depth The highest temperature
    increase during 16 mm drilling preparations was recorded with external irrigation
    during conical implant drill preparation of 3.5, 4.3 and 5 mm diameter, compared
    with internal and combined irrigation (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Lower
    temperatures could be detected with internal irrigation during conical implant
    drill preparation of 5 mm diameter compared with combined irrigation (P = 0.0369)
    (Figs 7a–d, Table 3). Discussion Previous investigations were performed on a variety
    of test specimens with various bone quantity and quality leading to controversial
    outcomes concerning the beneficial effects of different irrigation methods. Hence,
    to ensure a standardized bone density and an accurate ratio between cortical and
    cancellous bone, the temperature measurements for this study were performed on
    an artificially manufactured in vitro bone specimen of bovine origin. As these
    uniform bone samples provide a homogenous cortical and cancellous area, they could
    ensure constant thermal conductivity for temperature measurements by multichannel
    temperature sensors, allowing real-time detection at different tissue depths during
    implant osteotomies. In the present investigation, implant osteotomies with various
    irrigation methods (without/external/internal/combined) and unused drills of different
    diameters (2/3.5/4.3/5 mm) and drilling depths (10/16 mm) invariably revealed
    a mean temperature increase above the mean bone specimen baseline temperature
    at all predefined sensor depths. The mean temperature rise was below the defined
    critical temperature threshold of 47°C, according to results of recent surveys
    (Sener et al. 2009; Oh et al. 2011; Rashad et al. 2011; Harder et al. 2012; Marković
    et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2012; Strbac et al. 2012) when using various coolant
    methods with conical implant drills of different diameters (3.5/4.3/5 mm) and
    both drilling depths studied, just as for the 2 mm twist drills and 10 mm drilling
    depth. In contrast, for the drilling depth of 16 mm, twist drills with 2 mm diameter
    generated temperature changes in excess of the harmful threshold of 47°C, regardless
    of the coolant method used and the intermittent drilling procedure, indicating
    that the geometry of a twist drill may impact the results due to remaining of
    bone chips in the bone cavity during rotating and penetrating and leading to an
    insufficient removal and plugging of formed bone debris depending on the drilling
    depth (Cordioli & Majzoub 1997; Oh et al. 2011). Nevertheless, it should also
    be considered that the temperature rise during every osteotomy is probably much
    higher than the recorded one and may more frequently exceed the threshold of 47°C,
    due to the fact that the temperature sensors only provide information from the
    predetermined distance of 1 and 2 mm and not directly from the contact surface
    of the drill. It is quite clear that thermal measurement in direct contact with
    the cutting surface of the surgical drill would damage the temperature sensors
    as previously reported by other authors (Cordioli & Majzoub 1997; Ercoli et al.
    2004; Harder et al. 2012). In this study, we tried to compensate this limitation
    of the generally used thermocouples and improve the evaluation method by developing
    a much more sensitive custom-built thermoprobe with seven multichannel temperature
    sensors in predefined measurement depths and thus gain additional valuable information
    on the generation of intrabone temperature changes (Strbac et al. 2012). Using
    these modified thermoprobes, the highest temperature increases during implant
    sequences with various implant drills were seen – as to be expected – without
    any irrigation method followed by commonly used external and finally with internal
    and combined cooling. These results are consistent with previously published results
    showing that adequate osteotomy irrigation is mandatory to avoid overheating and
    irreversible damage of bone and surrounding tissues (Krause et al. 1982; Yacker
    & Klein 1996; Abouzgia & James 1997; Sener et al. 2009; Yoshida et al. 2009; Strbac
    et al. 2012). The highest temperature increases with both thermoprobes occurred
    at 16 mm depth osteotomies compared with the measurements during 10 mm drilling
    for every drill configuration, regardless of whether an irrigation method was
    applied or not. The fact that deeper osteotomies induce a more marked heat generation
    is consistent with the findings of recent publications indicating that depth is
    a predominant factor for temperature increase (Cordioli & Majzoub 1997; Sener
    et al. 2009; Sumer et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2012; Strbac et al. 2012). As
    greater drilling depths increase frictional forces and shearing energy, generating
    temperature rise in turn, the duration of drilling is also to be considered as
    a factor influencing heat generation in bone preparations (Eriksson et al. 1984;
    Abouzgia & Symington 1996; Abouzgia & James 1997; Reingewirtz et al. 1997; Tehemar
    1999; Sharawy et al. 2002; Sener et al. 2009; Strbac et al. 2012). This additional
    inducing factor could be confirmed in this investigation by using a constant intermittent
    procedure which ensured a defined standard drilling duration for the two different
    drilling depths of 10 mm (27.6 s) and 16 mm (43.5 s). Previous studies suggested
    that the reduction in the contact area between the cutting surface of the drills
    and bone might reduce these frictional forces and lead to temperature decrease,
    thus identifying drill geometry as a factor in heat generation (Cordioli & Majzoub
    1997; Oh et al. 2011; Scarano et al. 2011). In the present evaluation, following
    the recommendations of previous surveys for an established standard and atraumatic
    surgical procedure, a twist implant drill of 2 mm diameter was used primarily
    for graduated osteotomy. The twist implant drill showed the highest temperature
    increase as compared to the other conical drills of various widths evaluated,
    regardless of the coolant method used and the drilling depth. Using a graduated
    drilling procedure, we could also demonstrate that the narrowest conical implant
    drill was associated with the greatest temperature increase among the conical
    drills confirming the hypothesis that drills with greater diameter induce less
    heat increase than drills with smaller diameter in graduated bone drilling (Branemark
    et al. 1977; Eriksson & Adell 1986; Tehemar 1999; Oh et al. 2011). This influencing
    factor is the consequence of a graduated drilling procedure in which the initial
    drilling with the preceding surgical bur results in a removal of substantial amount
    of cortical and cancellous bone, followed by drills of sequential diameter with
    a smaller quantity of cutting debris and thus with reduced frictional resistance.
    Moreover, it can be assumed that the removal and reduction depend on the irrigation
    method used. The present study indicates that irrigation is obligatory when drilling
    is performed with conical implant drills, revealing significantly higher temperature
    differences without any irrigation as compared to external, internal and combined
    irrigation and confirming the results of the previous investigation by the authors
    (Strbac et al. 2012). In general, an external irrigation method is accepted and
    used in clinical practice (Tehemar 1999; Benington et al. 2002; Sener et al. 2009).
    However, it has been suggested that an internal irrigation system may be more
    beneficial in deeper site osteotomies as compared to the commonly used external
    cooling with respect to temperature increase by sufficient removal and prevention
    of clogging of the surgical drills by cutting bone debris (Lavelle & Wedgwood
    1980; Haider et al. 1993; Tehemar 1999; Proff et al. 2006; Strbac et al. 2012).
    In addition, a feasible combined irrigation system has been supposed to combine
    the beneficial effects of an external and an internal irrigation method in decreasing
    intrabone heat generation (Haider et al. 1993; Strbac et al. 2012). In the present
    study, the internal and combined irrigation methods were associated with a significantly
    smaller temperature increase compared with an external cooling with both investigated
    drilling depths evaluated and surgical drills of any diameter. This obviously
    confirms the hypothesis of the benefits of an internal and combined irrigation
    method as previously reported (Haider et al. 1993; Harder et al. 2012; Strbac
    et al. 2012). Only the investigated twist drill of 2 mm diameter showed significantly
    smaller temperature differences during 10 mm drilling depths by the aid of the
    external irrigation, always compared with internal and combined irrigation, indicating
    that drill geometry and drill flutes may play a major role for the efficiency
    of a cooling system. The fact that the efficacy of the external irrigation system
    is more evident at superficial areas and the supply of internal irrigation by
    capillary surgical drills is more beneficial in deeper parts of the osteotomy,
    may be responsible for the results, when using the investigated twist drill with
    10 mm drilling sequences, as previously suggested (Lavelle & Wedgwood 1980; Haider
    et al. 1993; Tehemar 1999; Strbac et al. 2012). However, internal and combined
    cooling was proven to be superior to an external irrigation by the use of the
    implant twist drill for deeper site osteotomies of 16 mm as already noted in the
    previous investigation by the authors, in which a bovine rib model was used (Strbac
    et al. 2012). As regards the efficiency of internal and combined irrigation, it
    could be demonstrated that the effect of an internal irrigation appears to be
    more beneficial with the use of twist and conical implant drills for both drilling
    depths evaluated as compared to a combined irrigation, verifying that a combined
    cooling may not always completely combine all the separate benefits of external
    and internal irrigation. From the perspective of the investigated material, studies
    having evaluated temperature differences between different irrigation methods
    should be considered with caution concerning the beneficial effects of the commonly
    used external irrigation when being used under clinical conditions. Based on the
    data of the current study on a standardized bone model of morphology and density
    type 2 (Lekholm & Zarb 1985), in which we tried to simulate clinical conditions,
    and based on the results of our recent investigation using a common bovine rib
    specimen, internal irrigation demonstrated more beneficial effects than the combined
    irrigation, followed by the more often clinically used external cooling (Strbac
    et al. 2012). Just like previous studies, the results of the present investigation
    revealed drill geometry as a significant predictor of heat generation, influenced
    by the type of the saline irrigation supply. This consideration indicates the
    need of further modifications mainly focused on the pilot twist drill revealing
    the highest temperature increase. Such modifications could include a greater amount
    of drill flutes, changed tip geometry and reduction in contact area. Moreover,
    future investigations should evaluate whether additional cooling of the irrigation
    fluid to temperatures below the suggested 21 ± 1°C (room temperature) may have
    an influence on the intrabone heat production with various irrigation supplies
    to reduce frictional heat and thus avoid overheating and irreversible damage of
    bone and surrounding tissues. In summary, the results of this study could help
    to improve future test methods during implant osteotomies for comparable investigations,
    focusing on modifications of surgical techniques and materials for the further
    development of new treatment procedures that could increase the reliability of
    dental implants. To our knowledge, the present investigation is the first one
    introducing a fully standardized organic bone specimen as a testing model for
    temperature measurements during implant osteotomies, ensuring analogous thermal
    conductivity and equivalent bone density for each cortical and cancellous bone
    area. In the context of our research, a set-up developed for this purpose and
    using a much more sensitive temperature measurement system permitted us to introduce
    a reproducible and accessible method that could also be used in future as a study
    design in combination with a uniform bovine specimen for collecting additional
    and comparable results. Conclusion In this evaluation, a manufactured in vitro
    bovine specimen and a more sensitive temperature measurement system were introduced
    to record real-time temperature changes during intermittent and graduated implant
    osteotomies with different irrigation methods. This investigation could demonstrate
    that saline irrigation is indispensable during drilling to avoid the harmful temperature
    threshold of 47°C. Furthermore, this survey has confirmed that internal and combined
    irrigation is more beneficial compared with external cooling during an intermittent
    and graduated drilling procedure. As a huge variety of testing methods and specimens
    have been described in current literature with controversial results concerning
    the beneficial effect of different irrigation methods, future studies could deploy
    a standardized set-up for measuring and documenting heat generation so as to gain
    further comparable results for clinical use. Acknowledgements The authors wish

  description: 'Fertigation is an irrigation technology of integration of water and
    fertilizer, and has been widely used in micro-irrigation systems, because of uniform
    fertilization, high utilization of water and fertilizer, and effectively reducing
    the pollution of soil and environment. The venturi fertilizer injector has become
    one of the main means and important equipment to achieve fertigation due to its
    simple structure, economy, and practicability, but the liquid fertilizer concentration
    could not be easily adjusted automatically. In order to realize variable rate
    fertilization with a venturi fertilizer injector, a variable fertilizer apparatus
    based on PWM (pulse width modulation) technology has been developed, but the apparatus
    belongs to open-loop control from the perspective of automatic control, and its
    accuracy and stability is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, a closed-loop control
    automatic fertilizer-mixing device was developed to improve the liquid fertilizer
    concentration mixing accuracy and stability, by improving the structure of the
    variable fertilizer apparatus and adding a conductivity meter that was employed
    to feedback the real-time fertilizer solution concentration indirectly. The conductivity
    meter was designed based on a conductivity electrode, and a square signal whose
    amplitude is ±3.5 V was determined as the excitation signal of the conductivity
    meter through experiments, to weaken or even eliminate polarization effects and
    capacitance effects of the conductivity electrode in the measuring process. In
    order to further improve measuring accuracy, temperature compensation had been
    applied to the conductivity meter, the measuring range had been divided into several
    small-scale ranges which could be switched by a multiplexer ADG1408 controlled
    by a microcontroller, and the corresponding divider resistor and square signal
    frequency of each small scale range were determined by experiments. By comparison
    with a standard conductivity meter, whose model is sension 156, the effective
    measuring range of the conductivity meter designed was 0-12.64 mS/cm, and the
    conductivity meter designed was calibrated according to the data measured in the
    effective measuring range. It was known that the conductivity of the fertilizer
    solution measured by the conductivity meter has a significant linear relationship
    (the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.997) with the fertilizer solution concentration,
    based on conductivity testing of a series of different concentration fertilizer
    solutions prepared in the range of 0.1%-1.0%. In order to improve the control
    performance of the automatic fertilizer mixing device, a kind of control strategy
    of two-step regulating with coarse adjustment and fine adjustment was employed:
    first, the device adjusted the duty cycle of PWM for controlling the solenoid
    valve to mix fertilizer automatically, by calling the corresponding function based
    on the detected inlet water pressure; then the device uses a fuzzy control algorithm
    to regulate the duty cycle of PWM finely, according to the real-time fertilizer
    solution concentration measured by the designed conductivity meter, in order to
    make the mixed fertilizer concentration get close to the target concentration
    as much as possible. An actual test and verification had been undertaken for the
    fertilizer mixing device, and the results showed that the maximum error of the
    mixed fertilizer concentration was 0.04% and the response time of the control
    device for achieving steady-state was 7.8-10.4 s, and it is now known that the
    device can meet the requirements of practical application in agriculture.'

    PWM（pulse width modulation）控制的占空比进行混肥；然后以电导率测量仪实时反馈混肥浓度，并采用模糊控制算法进一步细调PWM的占空比，使混肥浓度尽量逼近目标浓度。试验结果表明，电导率测量仪的有效测量范围为0~12.64
    mS/cm，它所测量的电导率与肥液浓度呈显著的线性关系，其决定系数 R2为0.997。对混肥装置进行了实测验证，结果表明混肥时的最大浓度误差为0.04%，控制装置达到稳态的响应时间为7.8～10.4
    s，能满足实际应用的要求。 关键词： 肥料模糊控制自动混合液体肥液浓度电导率 分类号： S224.21(农业机械及农具) 资助基金： 现代农业产业技术体系建设专项

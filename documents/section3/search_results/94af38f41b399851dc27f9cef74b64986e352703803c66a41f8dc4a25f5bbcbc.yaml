    Keywords:   Crop water productivity, Decision support system, Internet of things,
    Remote sensing, SCADA, Soil water content. Highlights. Precision agriculture (PA)
    applications in irrigation are stymied by lack of decision support systems. Modern
    PA relies on sensor systems and near real-time feedback for irrigation decision
    support and control. Sophisticated understanding of biophysics and biological
    systems now guides site-specific irrigation. The internet of things (IOT) enables
    new ways to increase yield per unit of water used and nutrient use efficiency.

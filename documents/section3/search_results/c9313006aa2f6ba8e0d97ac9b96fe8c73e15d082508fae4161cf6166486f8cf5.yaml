    \ sensor network (WSN) applications in agriculture are\ndiscussed in the current\
    \ academic literature. On the basis of bibliometric techniques, 2444 publications\n\
    were extracted from the Scopus database and analyzed to identify the temporal\
    \ distribution of\nWSN research, the most productive journals, the most cited\
    \ authors, the most inﬂuential studies,\nand the most relevant keywords. The computer\
    \ program VOSviewer was used to generate the\nkeyword co-occurrence network and\
    \ partition the pertinent literature. Findings show the remarkable\ngrowth of\
    \ WSN research in recent years. The most relevant journals, cited countries, and\
    \ inﬂuential\nstudies were also identiﬁed. The main results from the keyword co-occurrence\
    \ clustering and the\ndetailed analysis illustrate that WSN is a key enabler for\
    \ precision agriculture. WSN research also\nfocuses on the role of other technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artiﬁcial\nintelligence, and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles in supporting several agriculture activities, including\n\
    smart irrigation and soil management. This study illuminates researchers’ and\
    \ practitioners’ views\nof what has been researched and identiﬁes possible opportunities\
    \ for future studies. To the authors’\nbest knowledge, this bibliometric study\
    \ represents the ﬁrst attempt to map global WSN research\nusing a comprehensive\
    \ sample of documents published over nearly three decades.\nKeywords: wireless\

    1. Introduction\nThe global population has witnessed considerable growth from\
    \ 2.5 billion in 1950\nto 7.8 billion today. It is estimated that the world population\
    \ will reach 9.7 billion by\n2050 [1]. As the most prominent food source, agriculture\
    \ has played a major role in human\ncivilization [2,3]. However, the exponential\
    \ increase in food demand due to population\ngrowth creates several pressing problems:\
    \ water and air pollution, greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, and global warming. These\
    \ issues, coupled with resource scarcity, accentuate the\nurgent need for adopting\
    \ novel and sustainable solutions [3–5]. Several researchers have\nincorporated\
    \ cutting-edge technologies to address these problems, including wireless sen-\n\
    sor networks (WSN) [6,7], the Internet of Things (IoT) [8–10], artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI)\ntechniques [11–13], spatial technologies [14], remote sensing [15,16],\
    \ computing technolo-\ngies [17–19], blockchain technology [20,21], big data [8,22],\
    \ and radio frequency identiﬁca-\ntion (RFID) [23]. These technologies gave birth\
    \ to smart and precision agriculture, which is\nestimated to reach $15.3 billion\
    \ in worth by 2025 [24].\nAs a collection of sensor nodes [25], WSN is of vital\
    \ importance due to its enabling\nrole in providing data for other layers and\
    \ technologies. Conceptually, WSN consists\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011. https://doi.org/10.3390/su132112011\n\

    2 of 22\nof numerous smart battery-powered nodes connecting through a wireless\
    \ network. En-\nhancements in micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) make these\
    \ nodes smaller, less\nexpensive, and energy-efﬁcient. These nodes are distributed\
    \ across the ﬁeld and are respon-\nsible for collecting data from the farm and\
    \ environment. These various data include soil\nmoisture, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and crop conditions, to name a few. Furthermore, minor\nprocessing is enabled\
    \ by the microcontrollers built in these nodes. Data and information\nare transmitted\
    \ directly or indirectly to a base station or a hub. This results in considerable\n\
    improvements in the decision-making process [2,26,27]. The signiﬁcant beneﬁts\
    \ and capa-\nbilities WSN offer (e.g., monitoring, automation, optimization, etc.)\
    \ have prompted several\nscholars to investigate the potential of this technology\
    \ for agriculture. For example, [28]\nhighlighted the vital importance of WSN\
    \ in precision agriculture. The authors discuss the\nuse of different sensors\
    \ in sensing different parameters and the application of various com-\nmunication\
    \ technologies for data transmission. Thakur et al. [29] investigated the extant\n\
    literature and summarized the different WSN technologies for implementing precision\n\
    agriculture. The role of WSN in monitoring ﬁelds, optimizing irrigation, and measuring\n\
    temperature and soil property is also illustrated. Similarly, Refs. [30,31] explored\
    \ agricul-\ntural challenges and WSN solutions, including resources optimization,\
    \ decision-making\nsupport, land monitoring, and energy efﬁciency. Ruiz-Garcia\
    \ et al. [32] investigated the de-\nvelopments and applications of WSN and RFID\
    \ in agriculture. Aznoli and Navimipour [33]\nexplored the enabling strategies\
    \ as one of the most challenging aspects of incorporating\nWSN in agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, Refs. [2,26,34] were among a plethora of researchers who\nsynthesized\
    \ WSN research in the agricultural literature. Although these studies contribute\n\
    to the WSN ﬁeld from different perspectives, a structured systematic review based\
    \ on\na quantitative approach such as bibliometrics is still missing. Therefore,\
    \ guided by the\nstudy of [35], we aim to ﬁll this gap and examine the extant\
    \ literature surrounding WSN\napplications in the agriculture sector. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ in this investigation we attempt to\nseek answers to the following questions:\n\
    1.\nWhat are the publication dynamics on the interplay between WSN and agriculture?\n\
    2.\nHow is WSN being used in agriculture?\n3.\nWhat are the main research gaps\
    \ regarding WSN applications in agriculture?\nBy answering these questions, our\
    \ study provides signiﬁcant insights, exploring the\nentire ﬁeld of WSN applications\
    \ and its journey in the agriculture domain. The current\nstudy offers academicians\
    \ and practitioners a signiﬁcant understanding of the potential\nfor WSN in agriculture,\
    \ the current state of the literature, research hotspots, and future\nresearch\
    \ directions. This could advance their knowledge in the ﬁeld, identify research\
    \ gaps,\nand inform them of successful practices necessary to implement WSN in\
    \ agriculture.\nThe article proceeds as follows. Bibliometric approach and protocols\
    \ are discussed in\nSection 2. The main ﬁndings, including descriptive analysis,\
    \ keywords analysis, clustering\nanalysis, are explained in Section 3. Section\
    \ 4 discusses in detail the results of the keyword\nco-occurrence network. The\
    \ last section brieﬂy concludes the paper.\n2. Methodology\nAmong literature review\
    \ methodologies, bibliometric analysis is a powerful quantita-\ntive tool using\
    \ different measures to extract the behavior and dynamics of a knowledge\ndomain\
    \ [36–39]. We drew on best practices [38,40–42] to investigate in a comprehensive\n\
    and objective way the entire ﬁeld of WSN in agriculture. Scopus was selected to\
    \ conduct\nthis study because it is regarded as one of the most reliable and trustworthy\
    \ databases\nwith the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed\
    \ research utilized by many\nscholars [43–45]. Figure 1 illustrates the research\
    \ process. Keywords including “wireless\nsensor network”, “WSN”, “agriculture”,\
    \ “farming”, “farmer*”, and “agricultural” were\nsearched in titles, abstracts,\
    \ and keywords. The keywords were connected with the logical\nconnectors OR and\

    \ explored the role of WSN and RFID in agriculture and the food\nsupply chain\

    from integrating these technologies in several ways, such as early warning in\
    \ emergencies\nand maintenance, energy efﬁciency, and cost efﬁciency. Furthermore,\
    \ [27] provided a com-\nprehensive review accompanied by global and Indian cases\
    \ about WSN potentials, applica-\ntions, architectures, different sensors, and\
    \ challenges in agriculture. Likewise, [2] explored\nthe WSN and wireless sensor\

    \ the importance of\ndifferent aspects of WSN in smart agriculture and greenhouse.\
    \ For instance, the primary\napplications of WSN in agriculture comprise environmental\

    To enrich previous analyses, we conducted trending topics analysis. We considered\n\
    authors’ keywords as the unit of analysis. The map was generated based on log\
    \ frequency.\nBy carrying out trending topics analysis, we depicted the evolution\
    \ of WSN applications\nin agriculture and their related emerging and hotspot topics,\
    \ as portrayed by Figure 4.\nWSN gained the most signiﬁcant attention in 2017\
    \ as one of the most important enablers\nof precision agriculture. In 2018, the\
    \ energy efﬁciency and security of WSN applications\nbecame a mainstream topic,\
    \ followed by developments in clustering and computing\ntechniques for improvements\
    \ in energy efﬁciency and performance in 2019. The most\ncritical keyword appearing\
    \ more frequently as a trending topic in 2019 was IoT due to\nits capability to\
    \ integrate multiple technologies with high efﬁciency and efﬁcacy. Various\ntechnologies\
    \ have become popular topics in this ﬁeld. We expect that the evolution and\n\
    utilization of complementary cutting-edge technologies will occur alongside WSN\

    \ of Research Foci\nWe adopted keywords co-occurrence analysis among various clustering\
    \ techniques\nsuch as co-citation network analysis or bibliographic coupling [73,74].\
    \ Although all these\ntechniques are powerful methods to identify different paradigms\
    \ in a research domain,\nthe method was conducted ﬁrst to enrich the previous\
    \ keywords analyses and, second,\nbecause the method enables us to extract the\
    \ actual content of publications [43]. Keyword\nco-occurrence analysis provides\
    \ insights into various research foci that contribute to the\ndevelopment of knowledge\
    \ at the intersection of WSN and agriculture. This relational\nbibliometric method\
    \ ﬁnds the author keywords (unit of analysis) that have appeared in\narticles\
    \ simultaneously. It sets the more frequent ones as clusters. As a result, scholars\n\
    could gain important insights about knowledge divergence and different paradigms\
    \ at\nthe intersection of WSN and agriculture [39,75]. To generate the network,\
    \ we started by\nextracting authors’ keywords in selected papers and reﬁning them\
    \ when necessary. For\ninstance, the full-length keywords were abbreviated (e.g.,\
    \ the phrase Wireless Sensor and\nActuator Network was replaced with WSAN). Next,\
    \ the resulting data were imported to\nVOSviewer. The network was constructed\
    \ by conducting density-based spatial clustering\nbased on the full counting method\
    \ [76]. The minimum number of keyword co-occurrence\nwas set at ﬁve, which makes\
    \ ﬁndings different if this cutoff is lower or higher than this\nvalue (see Table\
    \ 6). For instance, too low a cutoff value may result in a large number of\nclusters\
    \ in the network, which does not provide a clear view of the research topics focused\n\
    upon and entails some degree of subjectivity in regard to which clusters should\
    \ be included\nin the keyword co-occurrence analysis [77]. However, too high a\
    \ cutoff value may lead to\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n10 of 22\nonly a few\
    \ keywords being clustered, which reduces the representativeness and reliability\n\
    of the clustering outcomes [78]. Therefore, to obtain a meaningful visualization,\
    \ a cutoff\nvalue of ﬁve recommended by prior studies [79–81] was applied in our\
    \ review to obtain\na manageable number of clusters for the analysis [78]. Accordingly,\
    \ a network with ﬁve\nclusters was generated (see Figure 5). In the ﬁgure, each\
    \ node represents a keyword, and\nthe size of the node is proportional to its\
    \ frequency. The color of nodes indicates cluster\nmembership for the keywords.\
    \ Table 7 presents the top ten most frequent keywords in each\ncluster. In the\
    \ subsequent sections, we support our bibliometric analysis with a qualitative\n\
    review of WSN-related studies to provide in-depth details to the results of the\
    \ keyword\nco-occurrence network. More speciﬁcally, we discuss the studies addressing\
    \ the content of\nidentiﬁed clusters. The analysis of each cluster offers valuable\
    \ insights into existing and\nemerging themes within WSN research in the agriculture\

    Table 7 reveals that cluster 1 revolves around the critical role of WSN in precision\n\
    agriculture. The most important keywords in this cluster are “WSN”, “Precision\
    \ Agricul-\nture”, “Zigbee”, and “Agriculture”. As a promising technology in precision\
    \ agriculture,\nWSN is expected to modernize data collection in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld and support the\nautomation of agriculture systems, which necessitate intensive\
    \ sensing of environmental\ncircumstances at the ground level [82]. The increasing\
    \ use of WSN applications in precision\nagriculture enhances the efﬁciency and\
    \ productivity of different agricultural production\nsystems. According to [83],\
    \ farmers could gain additional insights about their ﬁelds and\nidentify their\
    \ best solution by utilizing WSN. Elijah et al. [4] posit that the ability of\
    \ WSN\nto self-organize, self-conﬁgure, self-diagnose, and self-heal has made\
    \ the technology an\nexcellent alternative for smart agriculture. WSN can be used\
    \ to collect data related to\nsoil moisture, weather temperature, control irrigation\
    \ processes, and support farming\ndecision-making [51]. Therefore, the basic aim\
    \ of WSN adoption in agriculture is data\ncollection, environmental monitoring,\
    \ and data analysis [28,29].\nScholars have developed several protocols for sensor\
    \ nodes communication and WSN\nimplementation, including Zigbee, Bluetooth, and\
    \ Wi-Fi. As one of the most suitable\ntools for precision agriculture applications,\
    \ Zigbee facilitates irrigation supervision, water\nquality management, and fertilizer\
    \ and pesticide monitoring, all of which need a cyclic\ninformation update [51].\
    \ Because of its energy-efﬁcient, ﬂexible, reliable, and affordable\nwireless\
    \ protocol, Zigbee simpliﬁes the monitoring of a wide variety of environmental\n\
    conditions, including soil health, weed-disease detection, crop growth, and agricultural\n\
    product quality [84]. Precision agriculture is a well-suited ﬁeld for the integration\
    \ of\nZigbee. For example, [85] developed an intelligent irrigation system based\
    \ on the Zigbee\nnetwork protocol. In this system, the sensor node involves soil\
    \ moisture sensors that aim\nto control the water level in the soil, while the\
    \ actuator node is meant to take actions\nconsidering the soil’s water level.\
    \ Zigbee also shows advantages in protected agriculture\ndue to its capability\
    \ to overcome the limitations of wire connection and facilitate greenhouse\nmanagement\
    \ development [86]. Incorporating Zigbee-based WSN systems is a step forward\n\
    in the automation and efﬁciency of greenhouse environment monitoring and control\
    \ since\nthey can be easily maintained [87]. The climate conditions of greenhouses\
    \ (e.g., humidity,\ntemperature, light, and air pressure) can be monitored and\
    \ controlled in real-time owing\nto WSN, thereby optimizing plant growth, increasing\
    \ yield production, and mitigating\nharmful disasters in farms [51]. Greenhouses\
    \ could greatly beneﬁt from the low power\nconsumption and long communication\
    \ range of WSN to monitor and predict the health\nof plants, ensure adequate supply\
    \ of nutrients, and provide a cost-effective approach for\nprecision agriculture\
    \ in greenhouses [88].\nWith high similarity with WSN, RFID is another wireless\
    \ sensor technology that\nhas gained scholars’ attention [32]. It is developed\
    \ for identifying, categorizing, and\ntracking the ﬂow of goods [5]. As such,\
    \ RFID simpliﬁes the tracking of agricultural\nproducts [5], irrigation facilities\
    \ management [89], and wireless real-time communication\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 12011\n12 of 22\nwith agriculture sensors (e.g., soil temperature sensors)\
    \ [55]. Furthermore, RFID tags\nprovide energy harvesting capabilities because\
    \ the power of the radio-frequency ﬁeld\ncan exceed what the tag requires for\
    \ its operation [23]. In agriculture, energy harvesting\nis crucial to extend\
    \ the lifetime of sensor nodes [51] and improve the performance of\nWSN-based\
    \ systems [27]. When powered by energy harvesting, WSN can contribute\nto developing\
    \ more sustainable agricultural systems that increase farming productivity\nand\
    \ efﬁciency.\nWhile the importance of WSN in supporting precision agriculture\
    \ has been widely rec-\nognized in the academic literature, several knowledge\
    \ gaps can be usefully addressed in fu-\nture studies. For instance, more focus\
    \ should be placed on designing more energy-efﬁcient\nsensors to reduce the cost\
    \ of wireless systems and improve the accuracy and efﬁciency\nof farming operations\
    \ [90]. One research direction worth examining is the improvement\nof quality\
    \ of service (QoS) of WSNs in terms of maintenance and implementation costs,\n\
    coverage, reliability, and energy consumption. This is crucial as the shift from\
    \ traditional\nagriculture to precision agriculture requires accuracy, easily\
    \ conﬁgurable topology designs,\nand appropriate hardware and software for coping\
    \ with ﬁeld environments [91,92]. In\naddition, the integration of WSN in agriculture\
    \ may necessitate the effective management\nand control of a large number of sensors\
    \ through reliable connectivity and with a simple\nconﬁguration [93]. Moving forward\
    \ within this direction means that future studies will\nhave to identify the topologies,\
    \ conﬁgurations, and communication protocols of WSNs that\nshould be considered\
    \ in different agriculture scenarios. Future research also needs to inves-\ntigate\
    \ WSN system viability and how they achieve agriculture sustainability considering\n\
    their long-term impacts on economic, environmental, and social dimensions.\n4.2.\
    \ Potentials of IoT, Cloud Computing, and AI for Agriculture\nThe second cluster\
    \ (shown in green) indicates the critical role of IoT and other comple-\nmentary\
    \ technologies in enhancing WSN implementation in agriculture. IoT has altered\
    \ the\noperation modes of agriculture and increased agricultural automation [4,5,94].\
    \ According\nto [95], IoT facilitates crop monitoring, optimizes agricultural\
    \ productivity, and increases\nfarmers’ proﬁtability. IoT provides a platform\
    \ to maintain real-time data and alert farmers\nto take necessary actions. Furthermore,\
    \ with the support of IoT sensors across farms,\nfarmers can obtain an abundance\
    \ of useful data, including soil, water, and temperature.\nIoT’s ability to act\
    \ as a framework to integrate several technologies, including wireless\nsensor\
    \ and actuator networks (WSANs), AI techniques and methods (e.g., ANN and ML),\n\
    computing technologies (e.g., cloud computing), UAVs, geospatial technologies,\
    \ end-user\napplications, among many others have recently gained scholars’ attention\
    \ [4,5,49,96]. Key-\nwords such as “cloud computing”, “LoRa”, “ML”, “ANN” are\
    \ therefore included in this\ncluster. Coupled with WSN, cloud computing offers\
    \ high-quality services, hardware-\nagnostic application tools, and sufﬁcient\
    \ storage capacity and computational resources\nto maintain and process the data\
    \ generated at the network [5]. Furthermore, cloud com-\nputing helps to overcome\
    \ the weaknesses of WSNs owing to its ability to offer open,\nmore ﬂexible, and\
    \ reconﬁgurable applications for monitoring and controlling agricultural\nprocesses\
    \ [97]. Similarly, cloud-based agriculture systems could be utilized to develop\
    \ a\nreliable architecture for farmers to gain timely and on-the-spot data via\
    \ WSN [98].\nThe contribution of LoRa to agriculture is also highlighted in the\
    \ literature. As such,\nLoRa represents one of the popular modulation techniques\
    \ that could be implemented in\nagriculture [99,100]. Owing to its long range,\
    \ LoRa supports irrigation and several precision\nagriculture applications and\
    \ enables wireless communication to remote ﬁelds [101]. LoRa\ncan be adequately\
    \ utilized in vast agricultural ﬁelds. Combined with LoRa transceivers,\nWSN can\
    \ augment sustainability in agriculture by equipping farmers with insightful and\n\
    usable data [102]. While the deployment of WSN generates massive and various data,\n\
    there is a need to process and make use of these data in agriculture. In this\
    \ regard, machine\nlearning is a useful technique that could be applied to the\
    \ data generated by WSN, thereby\nperforming predictions in agriculture. These\
    \ include estimations of available water for\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n\
    13 of 22\nirrigation [101], nutrients [4], and plant growth [103]. As another\
    \ AI technique, ANN is\nalso demonstrated useful to reinforce the predictive capabilities\
    \ of farmers. ANN can use\nagriculture data collected by IoT sensors to select\
    \ crop varieties and predict their production\nrate [104], estimate the levels\
    \ of phosphorus in the soil [105], and support decision-making\nprocesses [106].\n\
    Summarizing, the literature on the possibilities of these technologies is rich,\
    \ and\nseveral opportunities for future research exist. For example, scholars\
    \ need to investigate\nhow IoT and WSN can be applied in protected agriculture\
    \ to reduce human intervention,\nsave energy, and maximize efﬁciency in ﬁeld monitoring.\
    \ Examination of the methods\nand solutions to secure agriculture data is necessary\
    \ to ensure that WSN becomes a re-\nsilient, safe, and trustable network. In the\
    \ context of cloud computing, further studies are\nrequired to understand the\
    \ role of this technology to bring ﬁnancially economical agricul-\ntural systems\
    \ [107] and enhance their technical properties, including scalability, efﬁciency,\n\
    storage capacity, and overall performance [108]. To further accelerate the transition\
    \ toward\ndata-driven agriculture, the development of more precise, accurate,\
    \ and efﬁcient machine\nlearning algorithms constitutes an intriguing opportunity\
    \ for future research. This is crucial\nas farmers can rely on machine learning\
    \ to extract insights from the data-intensive pro-\ncesses and support decision-making\
    \ in farming operational environments. As a popular AI\ntool, scholars also need\
    \ to examine the contributions of ANN at each stage of agricultural\nproduction\
    \ and how this technology can solve relevant tasks and pending issues in the\n\
    agriculture sector.\n4.3. Potentials of Clustering and UAVs for Agriculture\n\
    Energy efﬁciency and consumption are the main research foci of the third (blue)\
    \ cluster.\nCurrently, there are extensive debates about energy consumption, resource\
    \ limitation, and\nglobal warming at the global level [109–111]. WSN and other\
    \ enabling technologies could\ncontribute massively to energy efﬁciency in agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Table 7, the high\noccurrence of “Sensor Network”, “Clustering”,\
    \ and “Energy Efﬁciency” reveals that the\neffective utilization of resources\
    \ is of paramount importance in agriculture. To maintain the\nstability of WSNs,\
    \ clustering could be used to collect data from sensor nodes, achieve energy\n\
    efﬁciency, and prevent channel contention and packet collision [112]. Clustering\
    \ is vital to\nprolong the lifetime of sensor networks and respond to the needs\
    \ of precision agriculture,\nwhich requires advanced methods and technologies\
    \ to minimize costs and maximize\nproductivity [113]. To solve the energy consumption\
    \ of sensors and WSN in general,\nseveral researchers developed various initiatives,\
    \ including DEC routing protocol [114],\nmobile data collector routing protocol\
    \ [115], MAC protocol [116], clustering technique [117],\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocol [118], LEACH protocol [119], localization and clustering\ntechniques\
    \ [120], among many others.\nFurthermore, agriculture implies large-scale monitoring,\
    \ which can beneﬁt from the\nmerge of WSN and UAVs. For instance, [121] argue\
    \ that UAVs can be a good alternative\nfor demanding activities that need long\
    \ observation periods, multiple sensors, data man-\nagement, long-term stability,\
    \ energy and computational resources, and high temporal and\nspatial resolution.\
    \ With the evolution of UAVs and vehicular networks, WSNs can gain\nadditional\
    \ functionalities because UAVs make some nodes dynamic and collect data and\n\
    maintain wireless communication in areas lacking ﬁxed communication infrastructure\
    \ [122].\nThrough navigation data and the waypoints produced by the ground station,\
    \ UAVs could\nautonomously navigate the targeted waypoints and collect ﬁeld image\
    \ data [123]. UAVs are\nalso equipped with the necessary features to capture the\
    \ required images, map the ﬁelds,\nand detect pests, diseases, or water stress\
    \ on the crops [124]. By leveraging their software\nand hardware, UAV activities\
    \ (e.g., pesticide spraying) can be monitored by means of the\nfeedback from WSN\
    \ placed at the ground level in speciﬁed locations on the agriculture\nﬁeld [125].\
    \ Nevertheless, the performance of UAVs rests on the routing protocol applied.\n\
    For example, geographic routing protocols, which offer high mobility networks\
    \ and high\nperformance with large UAVs, could boost UAV navigation capability.\
    \ Meanwhile, energy-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n14 of 22\nware routing protocols\
    \ and those requiring ample space are more suitable for improving\nUAV power capability\
    \ and storage capacity [126].\nWith the design of more energy-efﬁcient algorithms\
    \ for WSNs, there is an urgent\nneed to propose clustering methods that can use\
    \ available resources in agriculture WSNs\nmore efﬁciently, thereby extending\
    \ network lifetime and increasing energy efﬁciency. The\ninvestigation of how\
    \ to optimize the performance of UAVs when WSNs are used as a\nsource of information\
    \ is encouraged for future studies. This is important as after applying\nthe chemicals\
    \ by the UAV, [127] discovered that some areas of the crop did not have enough\n\
    chemicals due to speed and wind direction. As a result, the effective development\
    \ of WSN-\nbased agriculture systems with mobile nodes (i.e., sensors mounted\
    \ on UAVs) and UAVs\nrequire the deployment of lightweight software, the implementation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\nrouting protocols, and the minimization of data transferred\
    \ from WSN to UAVs.\n4.4. Development of Smart Irrigation\nThe yellow cluster\
    \ presents the WSNs’ role in developing smart irrigation systems.\nOn the one\
    \ hand, water is a scarce resource necessary for the sustainability of the earth\
    \ and\nhuman beings that need to be preserved [128]. On the other hand, water\
    \ is a necessary input\nfor agriculture productivity that should be managed to\
    \ ensure optimal crop yields [129].\nWSNs are one of the most promising solutions\
    \ that can be applied to develop smart\nirrigation systems [26]. Sensors distributed\
    \ across the ﬁeld and connected through a\nwireless network could provide more\
    \ detailed and accurate information about soil moisture,\nhumidity, temperature,\
    \ and other critical indicators compared to old wired methods. This\ninformation\
    \ could be utilized to automate irrigation and improve precision agriculture\n\
    practices [32]. In other words, each part of the land will receive the necessary\
    \ optimum\namount of water based on the real-time data that WSN provides. WSN\
    \ facilitates irrigation\nmanagement and rescheduling by automating access to\
    \ inﬁeld soil moisture status and\ncontrolling irrigation, maximizing the efﬁcient\
    \ utilization of water, and improving crop\nproduction [33].\nMicrocontroller-based\
    \ gateways could be used to control the quantity of water [130].\nMicrocontrollers\
    \ are essential in agriculture because they can convert analog data to\ndigital\
    \ data and provide automation and digital remote access capability [131]. Equally,\n\
    GSM technology could be used to share the data and information with farmers [132].\n\
    Hence, farmers could optimize their crop yields and water usage simultaneously.\
    \ The\nresearchers in this cluster are interested in WSN’s role in developing\
    \ smart irrigation\nsystems. They explored how better monitoring systems utilizing\
    \ wireless sensors should\nbe developed to provide helpful information (e.g.,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature) based\non different communication (e.g., GSM)\
    \ and computing (e.g., Atmeag328P microcontroller)\ntechnologies for irrigation\
    \ automation and efﬁciency [26,29,133]. For example, Giri and\nPippal, [130] develop\
    \ an automated irrigation system based on WSN and GPRS, [134]\ndesign a system\
    \ based on WSN and GPRS/GSM network to monitor soil and irrigation\nwater and\
    \ optimize water consumption, and [135] utilize WSN for promoting a site-speciﬁc\n\
    precision irrigation system.\nThe cost of implementing WSN-based irrigation systems\
    \ may not be affordable to\nsmall and budget-constrained farmers; thus, future\
    \ research should investigate the techni-\ncal and economic factors that explain\
    \ the acceptance of these systems in the agriculture\nsector [124]. Additionally,\
    \ scholars not only could contribute to research surrounding water\nmanagement\
    \ by optimizing water use via the implementation of novel technologies such\n\
    as WSN, IoT, AI, and computing technologies [136–138], but they could also concentrate\n\
    on alternative water resources such as graywater, drainage water, and recycled\
    \ wastewa-\nter [139], or developing various irrigation methods such as ﬂood irrigation,\
    \ spray irrigation,\ndrip irrigation, and nebulizer irrigation [124].\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 12011\n15 of 22\n4.5. Soil Management\nThe last (purple) cluster deals\
    \ with the critical role of WSN in enhancing soil manage-\nment. The vital importance\
    \ of soil property and conditions in agriculture is undeniable.\nAny advancement\
    \ in soil monitoring and management is a key factor in improving resource\nefﬁciency,\
    \ optimizing irrigation, maximizing crop yields, and minimizing environmental\n\
    effects [140,141]. WSN has the potential to play a vital role in soil management\
    \ because\nof its capability to handle huge amounts of data regarding different\
    \ soil attributes [34].\nWith WSN, soil data are sensed and gathered continuously.\
    \ Sensor nodes could perform\nminor processing, and the data and information are\
    \ sent to the base station for further\nanalysis. The resulting insightful information\
    \ could be utilized to measure the needs of\ncrops, determine the schedules (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation), and overall improve decision-making and\nproductivity [29]. To\
    \ be more speciﬁc, sensor nodes could be implemented to assess the\nsuitability\
    \ of the farmland for cultivation [82], analyze the spatiotemporal variation of\
    \ soil\ntemperature [142], and monitor temperature, humidity, and soil moisture\
    \ in real-time in\ngreenhouses [143]. Furthermore, sensor nodes could monitor\
    \ soil physical and biochemical\nattributes to increase productivity and decrease\
    \ environmental footprint [144]. Sensor\nnodes also could measure, monitor, and\
    \ integrate various soil quality parameters [145];\nautomate irrigation through\
    \ humidity, temperature, and pH sensors [133]; and measure\nsoil resistivity [146].\n\
    While academicians and practitioners are increasingly studying WSN’s potential\n\
    for soil management practices, future research needs to address some challenges\
    \ and\nresearch gaps. For example, improving sensing performance and reliability,\
    \ enhancing\nenergy efﬁciency, data processing capability of sensor nodes and\
    \ wireless communication,\ndeveloping energy-independent sensors [141], and improving\
    \ power sources [34] are\nimportant research areas. In addition, future work should\
    \ scrutinize the minimum number\nof sensor nodes required to minimize the overall\
    \ cost of WSN deployment in agriculture\nand achieve acceptable sensing accuracy\
    \ of soil.\n5. Conclusions\n5.1. Discussion of Findings\nThe main goal of this\
    \ study was to synthesize WSN applications in the agriculture\nsector and advance\
    \ the existing literature by highlighting several knowledge gaps for future\n\
    research. Using a bibliometric analysis and qualitative review of selected publications,\n\
    we determine the most important topics in existing research and unravel emerging\
    \ and\nprospective avenues for future research. To perform the analysis, a set\
    \ of 2444 papers was\nchosen and considered for the ﬁnal review. The review ﬁndings\
    \ can be useful to scholars\nactively examining WSN within the context of agriculture.\
    \ Despite the growing literature\non WSN, there is still a scarcity of publications\
    \ providing a holistic view of the future\ndevelopments of WSN in agriculture,\
    \ broadening the understanding of the subject and\nbridging this knowledge gap.\
    \ Therefore, our investigation attempted to achieve this by\nidentifying various\
    \ topics and research foci at the nexus of WSN and agriculture. Several\nrelevant\
    \ insights can be obtained from this review. First, the number of publications\n\
    dealing with WSN applications in agriculture has remarkably increased during 2002–2021.\n\
    The journal-wise distribution of WSN-related publications indicated that Sensors,\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Communications, and IEEE Sensors Journal are the major outlets\
    \ contributing to\nthe WSN and agriculture literature. Our study highlights the\
    \ relevance of these journals\nand their role in advancing WSN applications in\
    \ agriculture over time. Regarding the\nworldwide impact, Asian countries were\
    \ the most cited. The current review draws several\nexciting insights concerning\
    \ the role of WSN to support agriculture operations and increase\nthe efﬁciency\
    \ of farming processes. From this perspective, we identiﬁed the most globally\n\
    cited papers (see Table 4). As per these publications, WSN applications are striving\
    \ to\nestablish an efﬁcient and sustainable agriculture sector and respond to\
    \ precision agriculture\nneeds. WSN technologies garnered signiﬁcant attention\
    \ and gained momentum due to\ntheir ability to increase farmers’ understanding\
    \ of crop conditions, resource use, and\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n16 of\
    \ 22\nenvironmental circumstances, which would otherwise be challenging to capture.\
    \ Another\nbeneﬁt of WSN consists in automating ﬁeld operations, maximizing crop\
    \ yields, enhancing\nfood quality and safety, and increasing sustainability. As\
    \ a result, farmers can rely on\nthe technology to support their decision-making\
    \ procedures, reduce human intervention,\nimprove prediction accuracy, and decrease\
    \ pesticide use.\nBy analyzing the keyword dynamics, our research found that WSN,\
    \ IoT, Zigbee, RFID,\nUAV, and cloud computing are some of the common technologies\
    \ explored in the context\nof agriculture. WSN represents a signiﬁcant enabler\
    \ for precision agriculture since it helps\ncollect, monitor, and analyze data\
    \ from agriculture [28]. Similarly, WSN combines IoT\nsensors to interconnect,\
    \ thereby sensing real-time soil and climate conditions [147] and\nautomating\
    \ irrigation. IoT, clustering, RFID, and UAV are crucial enablers for establishing\n\
    smarter and more sustainable agriculture, beneﬁting farmers and consumers. Aside\
    \ from\nmirroring the progress of digitization, the identiﬁed themes illustrate\
    \ that WSN applications\nin agriculture are growing dramatically. However, despite\
    \ the extensive research on WSN,\nit is crucial to highlight the dearth of studies\
    \ investigating the convergence of WSN and\nother embryonic technologies such\
    \ as blockchain, 5G, augmented reality, and vertical farms.\nIntegrating these\
    \ technological developments enables farmers to perform more efﬁciently\nand innovatively;\
    \ nonetheless, the pending question remains how these solutions inﬂuence\nnegatively.\
    \ Therefore, our review results uncover and emphasize the urgent need for more\n\
    research investigating how WSN can reshape farming policies and achieve holistic\
    \ and\ninclusive sustainability in agriculture supply chains.\n5.2. Research Implications\n\
    This study offers insights for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers\
    \ to better\ngrasp the applications of WSN in agriculture and draw their attention\
    \ to scholarly output,\nresearch foci, and prospects for ﬂourishing WSN systems\
    \ in farming operations. Our\nstudy is useful for scholars attempting to increase\
    \ their understanding of what has been\nresearched to date in WSN and agriculture\
    \ and what needs further examination. In this\nrespect, the relevant ﬁndings from\
    \ employing the keyword co-occurrence clustering are the\npredominant themes from\
    \ the past literature on WSN applications in precision agriculture,\nIoT, cloud\
    \ computing, artiﬁcial intelligence, UAVs, smart irrigation, and soil management.\n\
    By taking advantage of these technologies, farmers can shift toward smarter agriculture\n\
    and make existing farming systems more robust, sophisticated, and efﬁcient. To\
    \ illuminate\nresearchers’ views on WSN-related topics, seminal works in the literature\
    \ can be built\nupon to comprehend the entire ﬁeld and uncover the hot and neglected\
    \ areas of WSN\nresearch in agriculture. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of research\
    \ foci and topics was\nmade through analyzing the keyword co-occurrence network.\
    \ Based on the generated\nclusters, the core content of WSN research and knowledge\
    \ gaps were discovered. The\nthree thematic hotspots in the WSN literature essentially\
    \ focus on various technologies,\nincluding IoT, AI, UAV, RFID, and cloud computing.\
    \ The review ﬁndings indicate that\nWSN is not a standalone technology; instead,\
    \ it combines diverse hardware and software\ntechnologies to improve agriculture.\
    \ The relationships among the key topics also ascertain\nthe essentiality of WSN\
    \ deployment in agriculture and the potential of the technology to\noffer more\
    \ efﬁcient agri-food processes. As a result, researchers, farmers, and practitioners\n\
    must work hard to improve the interoperability of WSN-based agriculture systems\
    \ and\ndevise appropriate and responsive practices and measures.\nOverall, the\
    \ present study leverages a new approach to systematize WSN research\nin the context\
    \ of agriculture, using techniques derived from bibliometrics to reach an\nobjective\
    \ and quantitative evaluation of the current state of WSN literature. To the authors’\n\
    knowledge, no exclusive and comprehensive review of WSN research exists so far,\
    \ albeit\nthe mounting interest in the technology and its critical role in promoting\
    \ more efﬁcient\nand sustainable agricultural practices. Our analysis of the present\
    \ status of this research\ndomain and knowledge gaps may favor the development\
    \ of new studies and contribute to\nthe global scholarly production on WSN and\
    \ agriculture.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 12011\n17 of 22\n5.3. Limitations and\
    \ Future Research Directions\nDespite its signiﬁcant contributions, this review\
    \ has some shortcomings that need to\nbe considered when interpreting the ﬁndings.\
    \ One of the main shortcomings is that we only\nchose publications from a single\
    \ scientiﬁc database, Scopus. Although Scopus is regarded as\na source of publications,\
    \ further research may consider other alternative scientiﬁc databases\nsuch as\
    \ the Web of Science to extend our review ﬁndings by providing additional insights,\n\
    research trends, and other theoretical perspectives. Moreover, the literature\
    \ clustering via\nkeyword co-occurrence network can be supplemented by other bibliometric\
    \ techniques\nsuch as co-citation network analysis or bibliographic coupling to\
    \ generate additional\ninsights. Finally, as discussed in each cluster, we identiﬁed\
    \ various research gaps to address\nWSN applications in agricultural practices.\
    \ Energy efﬁciency in all parts of the system\nfrom design to sensors to communication\
    \ and clustering protocols, implementation and\nmaintenance costs, various technologies’\
    \ integration and their complementarities, social\nimpacts and environmental footprints,\
    \ and WSN systems’ viability and reliability are\namong the exciting topics for\
    \ further research.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.R. and A.A.; methodology,\

    \ multiagent system based on virtual organizations. The multiagent\nsystem manages\
    \ information from wireless sensor networks for knowledge discovery and decision\
    \ making in rural environments.\nThe multiagent system has been built over the\
    \ cloud computing paradigm to provide better flexibility and higher scalability\
    \ for\nhandling both small- and large-scale projects. The development of wireless\
    \ sensor network technology has allowed for its extension\nand application to\
    \ the rural environment, where the lives of the people interacting with the environment\
    \ can be improved. The\nuse of “smart” technologies can also improve the efficiency\
    \ and effectiveness of rural systems. The proposed multiagent system\nallows us\
    \ to analyse data collected by sensors for decision making in activities carried\
    \ out in a rural setting, thus, guaranteeing the\nbest performance in the ecosystem.\
    \ Since water is a scarce natural resource that should not be wasted, a case study\
    \ was conducted\nin an agricultural environment to test the proposed system’s\
    \ performance in optimizing the irrigation system in corn crops. The\narchitecture\
    \ collects information about the terrain and the climatic conditions through a\
    \ wireless sensor network deployed in the\ncrops. This way, the architecture can\
    \ learn about the needs of the crop and make efficient irrigation decisions. The\
    \ obtained results\nare very promising when compared to a traditional automatic\
    \ irrigation system.\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used\
    \ for collecting the\ninformation needed by intelligent environments in urban\
    \ and\nrural construction, smart cities, home and building automa-\ntion, industrial\
    \ applications, or smart hospitals [1–6]. WSNs\nsupport current requirements related\
    \ to the deployment of\nnetworks; they cover communication needs and are flexible\n\
    in time, space, and autonomy; they do not require a fixed\nstructure [7–9]. Currently,\
    \ several wireless technologies are\navailable on the market such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,\
    \ or Bluetooth;\nthey enable easier deployments than wired ones, avoiding the\n\
    need to wire buildings and decrease the costs and drawbacks\nof the setup phase.\
    \ The possibilities provided by WSNs allow\ndeveloping a wide range of applications,\
    \ such as energy\ncost control, monitoring of environmental data, security and\n\
    control of access to environments, and industrial and home\nautomation [10–13].\
    \ In this regard, telemonitoring (or sens-\ning) makes it possible to obtain information\
    \ about users and\ntheir environment. This allows offering the users customized\n\
    online services, considering the state of their environment.\nThe building automation\
    \ and control system market provides\nmany standards, protocols, and data distribution\
    \ systems,\nenabling different systems, like building automation systems,\nsecurity\
    \ systems, lighting systems, and others, to interact and\nintegrate with each\
    \ other [14, 15].\nHindawi\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume\

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nThe development of WSN technology\
    \ has allowed extend-\ning its application to the rural setting where it can be\
    \ used to\nfacilitate the daily activities of farmers. People’s interaction\n\
    with the environment can be improved and the use of\n“smart” technologies can\
    \ also improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of rural systems. Mobile computing,\
    \ grid com-\nputing, pervasive microsensing and actuation [16, 17], and\nrecent\
    \ advancements in wireless technologies may change\nour surrounding environment\
    \ in a way that we have not yet\nimagined. These emerging technologies can be\
    \ used to create\nsmart environments and improve the socioeconomic status\nof\
    \ rural areas. The different applications of WSNs in rural\nenvironments can include\
    \ e-services such as e-learning, e-\nacademics, e-business, e-medicine, and e-healthcare.\
    \ Those\napplications may facilitate an efficient connection between\nthe city\
    \ and remote rural areas.\nOther applications of WSNs to the rural setting aim\n\
    to prevent environmental degradation because of fires in\nfarming and forest areas.\
    \ Fires lead to pollution and to the loss\nof nutrients and soil microorganisms\
    \ [18, 19]. It also causes\nvegetation degradation as well as flora and fauna\
    \ diminution\nsince they disappear from the affected zone and are not\nreintegrated\
    \ in other areas. The application of WSNs not only\nin preventive but also in\
    \ postfire detection systems is of great\nbenefit. The use of sensors to detect\
    \ and monitor fire behavior\nhas allowed applying new technologies in this area.\
    \ Sensors\nused in such systems measure static and dynamic variables,\nlike humidity,\
    \ slope of the land, the type of fuel, the direction,\nthe speed of the wind,\
    \ smoke, etc. Thanks to that, they provide\nknowledge of how the fire spreads\
    \ and how to combat it\nefficiently.\nAnother area to which WSNs are applied within\
    \ the rural\ncontext is agriculture and therefore the food industry. Sensors\n\
    can be applied to measure parameters and gather information\non environmental\
    \ conditions affecting plant growth in areas\nthat are not as easily controllable\
    \ as those of a greenhouse.\nThey are important for weather monitoring and optimal\
    \ use\nof fertilizers in the field. Besides that, they can be used in\nspatial\
    \ data collection, precision irrigation, and fertigation\nas well as disease and\
    \ insect pest management. As for food\nindustry, the applications involve real\
    \ time temperature mea-\nsurement for thermal sterilization, irradiation, etc.\
    \ Bacterial\nconcentration in food products can also be sensed.\nAn important\
    \ feature of WSNs deployed in a rural setting\nis that they can collect heterogeneous\
    \ data from different\nenvironments. In this way, systems can learn about the\n\
    environment, making it possible to take adequate decisions\nand easing knowledge\
    \ discovery. The goal of this approach\nis to provide a smart environment able\
    \ to make decisions\nand efficiently manage resources. The process of collecting\n\
    heterogeneous information is related to the term “Big Data”\n[20], which deals\
    \ with the volume, variety, velocity, and\ncomplexity of data produced daily.\
    \ Big Data not only brings\ntogether large amounts of data; the paradigm also\
    \ makes it\npossible to process various data types. These data streams\ndemand\
    \ ever-greater processing speeds and yet their storage\nmust be economic. The\
    \ main goal of Big Data in research\nand technologies is to manage and transform\
    \ available real\ntime and historical data into knowledge and to make efficient\n\
    decisions based on organizational requirements and needs.\nIn the presented solution\
    \ this will be done with the data\nrecovered by the sensors. It will allow us\
    \ to optimize the use\nof the actuators in the system. Like the pivots in the\
    \ irrigation\nprocess, we will optimize the spent water knowing where to\nspend\
    \ it in the correct moment.\nReal Time Locating Systems (RTLS) are an example\
    \ of\nanother important application of WSNs [21, 22]. Although\nsystems like GPS\
    \ or the future Galileo perform well in\noutdoor localization, indoor localization\
    \ still needs further\ndevelopment, especially with respect to accuracy and the\n\
    use of low-cost and efficient infrastructures. Some of the\napplications of Real\
    \ Time Locating Systems include tracking\npeople, assets, and animals, access\
    \ control, wander pre-\nvention, warning and alert systems, controlling security\n\
    perimeter, and resources optimization. Companies need to\nuse some sort of monitoring\
    \ system to track their human and\ntechnical resources and, especially, to improve\
    \ their security,\nefficiency, and safety and reduce occupational hazards. User\n\
    identification is a key aspect for adequate services customiza-\ntion and environment\
    \ interaction. A good example of this is\nemergency situations where it is necessary\
    \ to locate people,\nfor example, in the case of forest fires or nuclear disasters.\
    \ To\nbe able to develop a platform that would integrate different\nsubsystems\
    \ for remote location and automation, it is first\nnecessary to create complex\
    \ and flexible applications.\nThe goal of this research, therefore, is to design\
    \ and\ndevelop a multiagent architecture aimed at gathering data\nand automating\
    \ rural environments for decision making and\nknowledge discovery on a cloud system.\
    \ This architecture,\nwhich is based on agent virtual organizations (VOs), will\n\
    give intelligence to the platform, real time response, and\nadaptation to the\
    \ needs of the application problem; and\nthe cloud will ensure that the platform\
    \ uses the required\nresources at all times. Recent tendencies have led to the\
    \ use\nof VOs, which can be thought of as a set of individuals and\ninstitutions\
    \ that need to coordinate resources and services\nacross institutional boundaries.\
    \ Thus, a VO is an open system\nformed by the grouping and collaboration of heterogeneous\n\
    entities. The most suitable technology for the development\nof these open systems\
    \ is Agent Technology, which makes\nit possible to form dynamic agent organizations.\
    \ Modelling\nopen multiagent organizations makes it possible to describe\nstructural\
    \ composition (i.e., roles, agent groups, interaction\npatterns, and role relationships)\
    \ and functional behaviors\n(i.e., agent tasks, plans, or services), and it can\
    \ incorpo-\nrate normative regulations for controlling agent behaviors,\ndynamic\
    \ entry/exit of components, and dynamic formation\nof agent groups [23, 24]. As\
    \ the development of open multi-\nagent systems is still a recent field in the\
    \ multiagent system\nparadigm, it is necessary to investigate new methods for\n\
    modelling open agent-based virtual organizations and inno-\nvative techniques\
    \ that will provide advanced organizational\nabilities to virtual organizations.\
    \ In that sense, the intelligence\nprovided by proposed architecture is based\
    \ on union of\nsupervised and unsupervised learning. On the one hand, we\nprovide\
    \ a subsystem able to learn from past experiences or\nalready classified data,\
    \ which guarantees the automation of\nthe system in decision making. On the other\
    \ hand, it is not\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n3\nalways possible\
    \ to collect labeled data as in the previous case.\nFor that reason, we have linked\
    \ the previous subsystem with\nanother of unsupervised learning. The latter will\
    \ allow us to\nfind groupings in data based on their distribution, on which\n\
    we can later classify or label the data based on the knowledge\nobtained from\
    \ the groupings found. The subsystem above has\nbeen used in this research to\
    \ recognise different crop areas\n(of different needs) focused on their features,\
    \ disclosed by\ndifferent sensors measuring environmental condition of the\ncrop.\
    \ All of the above allows us to use resources only when\nand where they are needed\
    \ as a means of optimizing resources\nin crops.\nFinally, this paper has been\
    \ divided into the following\nsections to reach the proposed aims: the Related\
    \ Work which\ndescribes the background and the works related to this\nresearch\
    \ as well as the main contribution of this research.\nThe Multiagent Architecture\
    \ Methodology describes the\nmethod used to develop the architecture, i.e., discretion\
    \ of\nthe different layers of the architecture and the multiagent\nsystem involved.\
    \ The case study section describes the features\nof the corn crop and pivot-based\
    \ irrigation system. The results\nreached in this section are given as the final\
    \ part. Conclusions\nand references are listed at the end of this document.\n\
    2. Related Work\nThe challenge of adapting Information and Communication\nTechnologies\
    \ (ICT) to the needs of the agrifood sector lies\nin the complexity of the problem\
    \ it faces: great diversity\nof products, fast deterioration of fresh products,\
    \ binding of\nagricultural production to weather conditions, existence of\ndiseases\
    \ or pests, limitations in the evaluation of the product\nquality by the final\
    \ consumer, distances between production\nand consumption areas, etc. To deal\
    \ with these aspects, an\nautomatic decision-making-oriented analysis is required\
    \ for\nlarge volumes of heterogeneous data collected from different\nsources [25–28].\n\
    The above cases exemplify the flow of products in the\nagrifood domain, which\
    \ move from the agricultural sector to\nthe food industry (agrifood logistics)\
    \ and finally are delivered\nto the consumer (food awareness). Precision agriculture\
    \ in\nprimary production [29, 30], tracking and tracing of food\nproducts along\
    \ their value chain [31], or identification of\nproduct characteristics through\
    \ labels and logos targeted at\nthe consumer [32] showed important initiatives\
    \ supporting\nthe needs imposed by the sector and the consumer.\nThe use of WSNs\
    \ in the cases listed above has contributed\nto the development of systems that\
    \ continually improve their\nperformance. This has been a reality, especially\
    \ in networks\nof radio frequency identification devices (RFID), which are\nclosely\
    \ linked to the organization of interenterprise agrifood\nprocesses, ranging from\
    \ the farm to the distribution com-\npany [33]. However, the process of selecting\
    \ and specifying\ntechnologies that improve business processes is becoming\nincreasingly\
    \ complex, due to the wide variety of existing\ndevices and the rapid developments\
    \ in this field.\nRFID technology is currently one of the most promising\ntechnologies\
    \ in self-identification and data capture (AIDC).\nThe main objective of RFID\
    \ systems is to collect data through\na transponder (tag) so that they can be\
    \ transmitted and\nreceived by a transceiver, all through a wireless communica-\n\
    tion channel. The possibility of accessing information without\nthe need for visual\
    \ contact with the tags is exploited in the\nidentification or location of assets\
    \ [33, 34]. Such capacity is\nrelevant in food tracking and tracing systems, through\
    \ the\nidentification of batches of individual products. In addition,\nthe continued\
    \ development of RFID is generating new use\ncases that go beyond the identification\
    \ functionality. To this\nend, RFID is integrated with other technologies, such\
    \ as\nsensor technology [35–37].\nThe advantage of RFID technology lies in the\
    \ fact that\nit is cheap enough to be incorporated into any physical\ndevice,\
    \ while providing bidirectional communication capac-\nities, allowing building\
    \ advanced organizational schemes,\nsuch as the Internet of Things (IoT, (ITU,\
    \ 2005)). RFID can\ncreate new business models on global device networks, where\n\
    each object is networked. Current RFID implementations\nshow great potential and\
    \ RFID may become a catalyst of\ntechnical evolution in the industrial sector\
    \ [38–40].\nIn general, agrofood data collection technology is char-\nacterized\
    \ by a wide variety of active devices in different\nparts/environments. The following\
    \ are the most common\nexamples in the majority of use cases [26]:\n(i) Data collection\
    \ on farms through the implementation\nof wireless sensor networks: they provide\
    \ information\non production indicators like precipitation, soil mois-\nture levels,\
    \ pesticide and fertilizer use, and more.\n(ii) Transport data capture: It includes\
    \ the location and\ninformation of the environment and data both inside\nand outside\
    \ the transport system, which allows us to\nknow the state of logistics.\n(iii)\
    \ Data capture of product quality indicators: the levels\nof humidity, oxygen,\
    \ nitrogen, and ethylene in the air\nact as indicators of the state of fruit and\
    \ vegetables,\nbeing relevant in storage and transport tasks.\n(iv) Data capture\
    \ from product packaging (logos and\nother) is to collect additional product information\
    \ on\ncloud.\nFocusing on the agricultural use case, small and medium\nsized farms\
    \ carry most of the weight of world production.\nEven though they are slower to\
    \ adopt IT solutions, due to\nlack of familiarity with technologies, belief that\
    \ the cost-\nbenefit ratio does not suit their needs or due to their lack of\n\
    knowledge they are not able to make use of the large amount\nof information that\
    \ these systems acquire [41]. Solutions\nto such problems may be found in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nFor example, the conferences of the International Society of\n\
    Precision Agriculture (ISPA, 2012) aim to collect information\nfor accounting\
    \ purposes and its subsequent automation. This\nimplies increased agricultural\
    \ automation and improvements\nin environmental technologies.\nIn this area, wireless\
    \ sensor network applications for\nirrigation facilities management based on radio\
    \ frequency\nidentification have been proposed in [42, 43]. Those applica-\ntions\
    \ were determined to be beneficial in the management of\nwater. This kind of systems\
    \ collect, analyse, and monitor data\n4\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    from a net of sensors installed in the field in a feedback loop\nwhich activates\
    \ the control devices based on precalculated\nthreshold value, like in [44]. Some\
    \ other works develop\napplications to allow the user to interact with the system\n\
    and make dynamical thresholds [45, 46]. Other systems,\ninstead of just thresholds,\
    \ do use linear programming models\nto optimize the resources like in [47]. Here\
    \ the authors\ncombine the idea of “knapsack” problem with a linear\nprogramming\
    \ model proving satisfactory results. The novelty\nof our solution is that it\
    \ proposes a combination of supervised\nand unsupervised learning, where, according\
    \ to the nature\nof the data, clustering and/or machine learning methods\nare\
    \ used for task optimization in the use of resources,\nwhile improving the crop\
    \ quality. Nowadays, in WSN based\nsystems, two computational paradigms are arising:\
    \ edge and\nfog computing. Regarding farming and precision agriculture,\nin [48]\
    \ the edge computing paradigm has been used in order\nto make the data they use\
    \ more private. To obtain this, the IoT\nsensors (edges) preprocess and analyse\
    \ the private data and\nsend the results to a server, where the results to estimate\
    \ and\npredict the total harvest yield are gathered. In [49], the above\nparadigms\
    \ have been used to create a smart farm monitoring\nsystem. The works previously\
    \ exposed deployed WSN inside\na building, but our solution deploys it in open\
    \ fields. IoT\ndevices are in the open field, so it is difficult to use a computer\n\
    with enough computing power to process all this data in\na fog computing way.\
    \ Furthermore, if the devices are not\nlightweight and compute the data in an\
    \ edge manner, the\nenergy consumed would be greater and it would mean that it\n\
    is needed to spend resources considering the batteries. That is\nwhy, instead\
    \ of trying fog or edge computing paradigms, we\nmust use the cloud computing\
    \ one.\n3. Multiagent Architecture Methodology\nThe main goal of this research\
    \ consists in the design and\ndevelopment of a new and innovative multiagent architec-\n\
    ture based on virtual organizations, capable of managing\nthe information collected\
    \ by wireless sensor networks (e.g.,\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, and GPRS)\
    \ for knowledge\ndiscovery and decision making in rural environments. The\nimplementation\
    \ of a prototype of this architecture has been\ndeveloped with Java (64-bits)\
    \ under the Java Agent Develop-\nment framework (JADE). The tests have been performed\
    \ on\na PC server model: PowerEdge R330, CPU: 4 CPUS x Intel\n\x02 Xeon \x02 CPU\
    \ E3-1220 v6 @ 3.00GHz, RAM: 31.83 GB, OS:\nVMware ESXi 6.5, and HDD: 1T.\nWireless\
    \ Sensor networks (WSNs) fall into the cate-\ngory of complex, distributed, interconnected\
    \ and rapidly\nchanging systems. Multiagent systems (MAS) have been\nidentified\
    \ as one of the most suitable artificial intelligence\nparadigms in the development\
    \ of WSNs, since MASs are\nrobust and autonomous in providing formalisms, algorithms,\n\
    and methodologies in satisfying the challenging needs of\nWSNs. Specifically,\
    \ MAS provide adaptiveness, decentralised\ncontrol, large scale, information uncertainty,\
    \ resource bound-\nedness, and physical distribution [23].\nThe proposed multiagent\
    \ platform will be built over the\ncloud computing paradigm to provide better\
    \ flexibility and\nhigher scalability for handling both, small- and large-scale\n\
    projects (e.g., individual homes, large hospitals, or even smart\ncities). Cloud\
    \ Computing can offer a very powerful, reli-\nable, predictable, and scalable\
    \ computing infrastructure for\nrunning multiagent systems by implementing agent-based\n\
    complex applications. These applications can rely on cloud\ncomputing infrastructures\
    \ to access and use vast amounts\nof processors and data. One key feature of software\
    \ agents\nis intelligence to solve complex problems. Such intelligence\ncan be\
    \ obtained through the collaboration of several agents\nrunning in a distributed\
    \ environment. The choice of cloud\ncomputing meets the requirements of MAS, providing\
    \ a\ndistributed environment and ensuring low runtimes and high\nperformance.\n\
    3.1. Multilayer and Multiagent Architecture. This subsection\ndescribes the multilayer\
    \ organization of the multiagent archi-\ntecture proposed in Figure 1. Each layer\
    \ shows an abstraction\nlevel by involving a different degree of gathering and\
    \ process-\ning information. The abstraction level implemented in each\nlayer\
    \ allows it to isolate itself from the responsibilities of its\nneighbouring layers.\
    \ This also makes it possible to decouple\nand reuse system components, giving\
    \ a greater adaptation to\nthe environment. Then, the responsibilities of each\
    \ layer can\nbe described as follows:\n(i) Layer 0: This layer is the physical\
    \ one, in which the\nnetwork of sensors and actuators of the system is\ndeployed.\
    \ Those devices can be based on different\ntechnologies and communication protocols,\
    \ Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, GPRS, etc., depending on\nthe characteristics\
    \ of the terrain where the system is\ndeployed.\n(ii) Layer 1: This is the data\
    \ receiving layer, which contains\nthe agents responsible for capturing the information\n\
    from the sensors and routing them to the upper layers\nto transform them into\
    \ a common format defined in\nthe platform. This layer is also responsible for\
    \ routing\nthe orders obtained from the upper layers to the\nactuators.\n(iii)\
    \ Layer 2: This is the data transformation and storage\nlayer. In this layer,\
    \ the data are transformed to a\ndetermined format, depending on the purpose for\n\
    which they will be used. For example, data collected\nfrom sensors need to be\
    \ merged before they are\nanalysed in the upper layers or are requested by\nactuators\
    \ in the physical layer. This layer is also\nresponsible for storing the captured\
    \ data to create a\nhistory for further analysis.\n(iv) Layer 3 (data analysis\
    \ layer): This is the layer where\nknowledge is discovered through the agents\
    \ responsi-\nble for the analysis of the collected information. This\nlayer defines\
    \ agents in charge of performing com-\nputations and applying supervised and unsupervised\n\
    learning techniques. Therefore, this layer makes it\npossible to take decisions\
    \ based on the collected data,\ngiving the most important part of the intelligence\
    \ of\nthe system.\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n5\nCloud management\
    \ layer\nPERSISTENCE\nDEPLOYMENT\nCOMPUTATION\nLAYER 0: Physical layer implementing\
    \ the deployment of\nsensors based on different technologies, Namely, Wi-Fi,\n\
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, GPRS,...\nLAYER 1: Data receiving layer, agent virtual\
    \ organization\nresponsible for capturing data from sensors and sending\nthem\
    \ to be processed by other virtual organizations.\nLAYER 2: Data transformation\
    \ layer, agent virtual\norganization responsible for transforming data to\ndetermined\
    \ formats, compatible with the architecture.\nLAYER 3: Data analytics layer, agent\
    \ virtual organization of\nknowledge discovery from data gathered in LAYER 2.\

    \ processing data\nKnowledge discovery process and decision making\nLAYER 4: User\
    \ interface layer, agent virtual organization of\nuser interaction in charge of\
    \ performing the user requests.\nMultilayer and Cloud Computing Architecture\n\
    for Knowledge Discovery from Rural Environments\nFigure 1: Organizational representation\
    \ of the agent-based multilayer architecture proposed for knowledge discovery\
    \ from rural areas. The\narchitecture has been designed under the cloud computing\
    \ paradigm.\n(v) Layer 4: This is the user interface layer, which interacts\n\
    with and fulfils the requests of system users. The rest\nof the layers back up\
    \ this layer to provide services such\nas process and device monitoring, analysis\
    \ of stored\ndata, and information visualization.\n3.2. Architecture Multiagent\
    \ System. The proposed architec-\nture’s multiagent system (MAS) is developed\
    \ based on virtual\norganizations (VOs), which perform previously defined tasks\n\
    in the architecture layers. As shown in Figure 2, several\nlinked VOs and agents\
    \ govern the proposed multiagent\nsystem, performing different roles to meet their\
    \ individual\ngoals that contribute to reaching the common goal of the\nsystem.\
    \ Each VO consists of a set of agents with specific roles\nwithin the organization.\
    \ Agents perform their tasks/roles and\ncollaborate with other agents from the\
    \ VO to achieve the\nobjectives of the organization. In addition, the introduced\n\
    MAS responds to the needs of each layer given in Figure 1;\nit has also been adapted\
    \ to manage and/or optimize the water\nflow in automatic irrigation systems for\
    \ crops. Thus, the aim\nof applying the MAS illustrated in Figure 2 to crop irrigation\n\
    systems is to incorporate intelligence into the irrigation\nprocess, allowing\
    \ the minimisation of water consumption.\nBelow, the roles of the agents and of\
    \ MAS VOs are described:\n(i) Manager agent (MA): This agent acts as a mediator\n\
    between VOs and agents defined in the MAS, and it is\nresponsible for coordinating\
    \ the operations between\nthem. The MA is primarily responsible for the man-\n\
    agement of agents that are encompassed within it.\nTherefore, it allows for the\
    \ creation and management\nof the life cycle of an organization or agent.\n(ii)\
    \ Heterogeneous data supervisor agent (HDMA): This\nagent handles communication\
    \ between the DRVO\nand DTVO organizations. Thus, HDMA receives all\nheterogeneous\
    \ data (data from different sensors have\ndifferent formats) collected by the\
    \ DRVO organi-\nzation and sends them to a specific agent in the\n6\nWireless\

    Figure 2: Flowchart of the agent virtual organizations integrating the multiagent\
    \ system for the control of irrigation in rural areas, such as\ncrops.\nDTVO organization,\
    \ which will convert the received\ndata into an internal common format and store\n\
    them in the corresponding database for their later\nretrieval. HDMA is also responsible\
    \ for providing\ndata (through the MA agent), in an indicated format,\nfrom the\
    \ previous VOs to the rest of entities in the\nMAS.\n(iii) Irrigation manager\
    \ agent (IMA): This agent manages\nthe automatic irrigation system in crops. This\
    \ agent\nconverts the results given by the KDVO organi-\nzation into an action\
    \ that is to be performed by\nthe irrigation control device. To do this, each\
    \ data\nanalysis result from KDVO is encoded to a bit\nsequence, which is interpreted\
    \ as an action or set\nof actions that are to be performed by the coupled\nirrigation\
    \ system. Such actions may be to start or stop\nwatering, increase or decrease\
    \ the water flow for a\ndetermined area of the crop, irrigate only a specified\n\
    number of crop areas, etc. In addition, this agent can\ncommunicate the activities\
    \ the irrigation system is\nperforming at any time, i.e., the activity that is\
    \ being\nperformed.\n(iv) UIVO virtual organization: This organization inter-\n\
    acts with the system users through a system interface\n(agent IA) where the user\
    \ can make requests in\nrelation to the activities being performed on the\ncrop,\
    \ obtain or analyse information from historical\ndata stored on the database,\
    \ and monitor sensors of\nthe crop or of a crop area. For such purposes, MA\n\
    and DAA agents communicate with the remaining\nentities (through the manager agent)\
    \ of the MAS to\nperform the tasks requested by users. Meanwhile, the\nMA agent\
    \ (in UIVO) starts the monitoring process\nthrough the DRVO organization and the\
    \ manager\nand HDMA agents. Also, the DAA agent starts the\nprocess of intelligent\
    \ analysis of the historical data by\nrunning the manager and HDMA agents along\
    \ with\nthe KDVO and DTVO organizations.\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    7\n(v) DRVO virtual organization: This VO groups the\nagents responsible for gathering\
    \ sensor data and is\ncomposed of an agent set, called DCAs (data capture\nagents).\
    \ Each DCA agent captures data from a sensor\ntype, so each agent is designated\
    \ for obtaining data\nfrom a particular sensor type, so that each agent\nmanages\
    \ several sensors of the same type and each\nagent is specialised in one type\
    \ of sensor. In addition\nto information gathered on the environmental fac-\n\
    tors measured by sensors, information such as crop\nidentifier, sensor, and area\
    \ where the sensor is located\nare also included. Note that the proposed architecture\n\
    and MAS have been designed to manage more than\none crop at a time.\n(vi) DTVO\
    \ virtual organization: This VO groups the\nagents that transform data from one\
    \ format into\nanother. Since data obtained from sensors in crops\nare heterogeneous,\
    \ it is necessary to convert such data\nto a common format that can be used by\
    \ the MAS.\nBasically, it is about converting the captured data\ninto the internal\
    \ structure of the database where the\nMAS implements and achieves the inverse\
    \ operation\nto such a conversion (i.e., from the database to\nanother format)\
    \ when it is requested. DTVO is also in\ncharge of storing converted data in the\
    \ corresponding\ndatabase and running queries on them. Each data\nformat agent\
    \ in this VO is an expert in one or more\nconversions of data formats. Note that\
    \ each database\nassociated with these agents corresponds to a different\ncrop,\
    \ in case the system manages more than one crop.\nFinally, DTVO is important for\
    \ the MAS because\nof the great number of heterogeneous data gathered\nfrom sensors.\n\
    (vii) KDVO virtual organization: This VO provides the\nMAS with intelligence by\
    \ incorporating agents based\non supervised and unsupervised learning. Thus,\n\
    KDVO oversees the knowledge discovery process\nfrom historical data which are\
    \ obtained from the\nsensors deployed in crops and stored in their corre-\nsponding\
    \ database. This allows us to find patterns in\nthe data and predict their behaviors\
    \ under different\ncircumstances. KDVO consists of five related agents\nas explained\
    \ below:\n(i) KMA agent: This agent provides the infor-\nmation needed by the\
    \ rest of agents of the\norganization to perform their tasks, so that\nKMA is\
    \ the link between external entities and\nthe VO; moreover, it determines the\
    \ agents to\nused and who will collaborate to solve data\nanalysis requests. Thus,\
    \ not all the agents of\nthe organization are used in a data analysis\nprocess\
    \ and the selection of the agents to be\nused depends on the type of presented\
    \ problem.\nFinally, KMA is also responsible for formatting\nthe collected data\
    \ to a dataset that can be\ngiven as input to the remaining agents of the\nVO.\n\
    (ii) CA agent: This agent collaborates with the rest of\nagents of the VO by providing\
    \ complex compu-\ntations from the data. CA applies predetermined\nformulas (statistical\
    \ computation) to collected\ndata such as temperature, relative humidity, and\n\
    CO2, to figure out the needs of the crop. One\nof the aims pursued by the formulas\
    \ above is to\nreach a precision irrigation and fertigation, as\nwell as disease\
    \ and insect pest management. But\nCA is only a part of the whole learning process\n\
    that allows knowledge discovery.\n(iii) ULA agent: This is the unsupervised learning\n\
    agent, which implements algorithms to be run\non unlabeled datasets. ULA is useful\
    \ when data\nhave not been classified into different groups,\nfor which a decision\
    \ must be made. This agent\nincludes different clustering algorithms such as,\n\
    Agnes, Diana, and Eisen [50]. These algorithms\nare applied to group similar areas\
    \ based on\nvalues gathered from the sensors located in\ndifferent areas of the\
    \ crop and make decisions\naccordingly. Note that a given crop area is\nidentified\
    \ by the values reported by its sen-\nsors. Hence, each area defines several sensor\n\
    groups of the same type. This way, each area\nis represented by an n-tuple (a\
    \ vector), where\neach component has a mean environmental\nvalue computed from\
    \ sensors of the same type.\nThus, the clustering algorithms group vectors\nstanding\
    \ for the features of each area of the crop.\n(iv) MLA agent: This agent performs\
    \ machine learn-\ning strategies when data are labeled to find\npatterns. This\
    \ agent builds classifiers whose pre-\ndiction is used in decision making or converted\n\
    to an action carried out in the crop. The above\nmeans that the resources used\
    \ in crops are\noptimized. This agent develops a Support Vec-\ntor Machine (SVM),\
    \ Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) and naive Bayes classifier [51].\n(v) CBR agent:\
    \ This agent performs case-based\nreasoning and similarly to the agent above it\
    \ is\nconvenient for situations where there is a set\nof cases and experience\
    \ in decision making to\nsolve a particular type of problems. Based on\npast experience,\
    \ CBR retrieves the most similar\ncase to the one to solve and adapt the solution\
    \ to\nsolve the new case. The new case and its solution\nare stored in the corresponding\
    \ knowledge base\nwhich will be used in the future to solve new\nproblems. For\
    \ the case that concerns us, a\ncase is represented as a value n-tuple being\n\
    environmental factor captured from sensors\nlocated in different areas of a crop.\
    \ A case-\nsolution means an action to be performed in\nthe crop like irrigation,\
    \ fertigation, and disease\nand insect pest management, among others. In\ngeneral,\
    \ a solution to a case means a decision\nmaking on the target rural area. Furthermore,\n\
    8\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nthe Euclidean distance is used\
    \ by default to\nrecover similar cases from knowledge base. Note\nthat the CBR\
    \ agent manages a knowledge base\nfor each crop, if needed.\nFinally, consider\
    \ that not all agents in this VO must be used in\na case study. Agents to be used\
    \ as well as their collaboration\nto solve a case study depend on the characteristics\
    \ imposed\nby the case study.\nA cloud system has been employed, as it allows\
    \ us to\napproach in real time, to adapt the response in real time\nand the context\
    \ of the case study, although edge computing\nmay be a more suitable way to optimize\
    \ processes, reducing\nlatencies, and consumption of less bandwidth [52]. However,\n\
    our system sends all data to the cloud at all times, immediately\naccessing the\
    \ results of the analysis and evaluation of the\nstatus of all these sensors and\
    \ devices. Note that although\nthe proposed architecture does not develop a complete\
    \ Big\nData system, some of the Big Data features are present in\nthe different\
    \ VOs. Features such as data capture in DRVO,\ndata storage with different formats\
    \ in DTVO, intelligent\ndata analysis through KDVO, and visualization and querying\n\
    in UIVO are key to define an architecture following the\nprinciples of Big Data\
    \ analytics. Thus, our proposal has\ndeveloped the basis to manage in the future,\
    \ volume, variety,\nand velocity in generated data.\n4. Case Study on Irrigation\
    \ in Corn Crops\nThis section details how the presented architecture adapts\n\
    to efficient management of agricultural environments. The\narchitecture adapts\
    \ to factors that change frequently (weather\nconditions) and have a critical\
    \ impact on the development\nof crops. Because the architecture is agent-based,\
    \ it has\nfeatures such as self-adaptation to dynamic environments,\nwhich allows\
    \ us to manage data from a variety of sources,\nextract knowledge, learn from\
    \ previous actions, and make\ndecisions within the context in which the system\
    \ is deployed.\nThe architecture monitors the factors that impact the crops’\n\
    watering needs; by controlling the irrigation system it covers\nthe hydrological\
    \ part and at the same time optimizes the use\nof water in crop irrigation.\n\
    4.1. Description of the Corn Crop. This subsection details\nthe scenario in which\
    \ the architecture based on virtual\nagent organizations has been implemented.\
    \ The architecture\nhas been deployed on an agricultural land of 40ha used\nfor\
    \ the cultivation of corn in the province of Salamanca,\nSpain (Table 1). This\
    \ allowed us to measure the architecture’s\neffectiveness in terms of adaptation\
    \ to the context, data\nmanagement, analysis, and optimization decisions in the\n\
    process of irrigating the crop. The surface of the crop was\ndivided into two\
    \ parts, one in which the corn will be\ntraditionally cultivated by irrigation\
    \ with pivot (control crop)\nwhile the other part involves irrigation with pivot\
    \ but the\nsystem will be managed through our platform (test crop).\nThe corn\
    \ crop is characterized by being a short-cycle crop\nand with a variable water\
    \ demand during the growth stage.\nThe crop surface was loose and aired at the\
    \ time of cultivation,\nTable 1: Geological characteristics of the corn crop in\
    \ the case study.\nCultivation area\nSize (ha)\n20\nSurface texture (0 - 30cm)\n\

    \ In the case study, the\nPioneer P0837 model of the Pioneer Hi-Bred-FAO 500 cycle\n\
    marketer was used. In Table 2, we can see the rest of the\ncharacteristics of\
    \ the crop.\nThe ideal temperature for the growth of the corn crop\nis between\
    \ 25 and 30∘C. It needs a lot of sunlight and in\nhumid climates its performance\
    \ is lower. For germination\ntaking place in the seed, the temperature must be\
    \ between 15\nand 20∘C. For the fructification stage, temperatures of 20 to\n\
    32∘C are needed. Temperatures below 8∘C and above 30∘C can\ncause serious problems\
    \ for the crop due to poor absorption of\nmineral nutrients and water.\n4.2. Description\
    \ of the Irrigation. The traditional method\nof watering crops was called flood\
    \ irrigation. Since a few\nyears, this method has been replaced by drip irrigation.\n\
    However, automotive irrigation has many advantages over\ndrip irrigation because\
    \ it is more efficient; it covers long\ndistances and adapts to the plot and above\
    \ all; it allows\nautomating the irrigation process. This case study uses a pivot\n\
    that has a circular displacement, so the distribution of water is\nvery uneven\
    \ along the side: little water is needed at the centre,\nbeing further away from\
    \ the centre leads to the requirement\nof more water as there are more square\
    \ meters to cover. The\ntowers are moved by small electric motors (0.5-1.5 HP)\
    \ at very\nslow and adjustable speed. While the machine is advancing,\nirrigation\
    \ is taking place. Then, the pivot used in the corn\nWireless Communications and\
    \ Mobile Computing\n9\n55m\n14m\nFigure 3: Structure of the pivot used in the\
    \ presented case study.\ncrop (see Figure 3) consists of 3 towers of 55 meters\
    \ and\nan overhang of 14 meters with a high-speed motor of 1.5HP\nat 86rpm at\
    \ 60Hz that moves at 2.3m/min. The end-gun is\nlocated at the tip of the overhang\
    \ with a section of 127, and\nthe sprinklers are rotor type, with a ground clearance\
    \ height\nof 4.40m. The system has a 52,000l sprinkler chart to cover\nthe needs\
    \ of a 20ha land.\nThe pivot irrigation system is automated by the IMA\nagent.\
    \ This agent makes decisions based on the information\ncollected from the WSN\
    \ and sends commands to the irri-\ngation control device. The deployed WSN allows\
    \ the agents\nfrom the DRVO VO to collect the data necessary to determine\nthe\
    \ amount of water the crop needs and to command the\npivot to move and irrigate.\
    \ WSN sensors collect temperature,\nhumidity, wind, height, or light hours temperature.\
    \ These\nparameters influence the water needs of maize and allow\nthe architecture\
    \ to adjust irrigation and in this way optimize\nwater consumption. When temperatures\
    \ are high, plants will\nabsorb more water from the soil, as perspiration increases.\n\
    The corn crop that is at sea level needs more water because the\nsoil in which\
    \ it grows is warmer than that of a crop growing\nat higher altitudes. Ambient\
    \ humidity provides the amount\nof actual water vapour contained in the air and\
    \ the amount\nof water vapour it would need to contain to saturate it at the\n\
    same temperature. Wind causes water to be lost or the land to\ndry faster.\nTo\
    \ control the above issues, the KDVO virtual organi-\nzation is in charge of finding\
    \ out how much water a crop\nloses through evapotranspiration, ETc. This amount\
    \ of water\nis defined as the crop’s water requirement and it must be\nsupplied.\
    \ The CA agent calculates the water lost by ETc evap-\notranspiration using the\
    \ climatic parameters (temperature,\nhumidity, wind, precipitation, and solar\
    \ radiation). To this\nend, the Penman Monteith [53] method was used in the\n\
    architecture to determine the evapotranspiration rate, ETo.\n\U0001D438\U0001D447\

    the water used by the pivot. However, not all rainfall is\nuseful; among other\
    \ factors losses are caused by excessive\ndryness, wind, or runoff. For this reason,\
    \ the architecture\nconsidered 75% of precipitation as effective precipitation\
    \ (Pe).\nWith effective precipitation, the system has estimated net\nrequirements\
    \ (Nn) for maize in mm/month. The architecture\ncalculated the amount of water\
    \ that the cultivated area (Nn)\nhas to receive in order to satisfy the needs\
    \ of the plants\nand have the maximum possible production, insofar as it\ndepends\
    \ on the water. In calculating net requirements, it was\nconsidered that the case\
    \ study uses a central pivot irrigation\nsystem, which has an efficiency ratio\
    \ of 85%. In Table 5 we can\nsee the needs of the corn cultivation.\nAs the pivot\
    \ used in the case study has 3 towers with a\nseparation of 55m each and an overhang\
    \ of end-gun (14m),\nthe last tower is located 165m from the central pivot. In\n\
    addition, the pivot moves at a speed of 1.6m/min, so it needs\nas much time as\
    \ follows.\nTime = 2\U0001D70F ∗ 165\n2.3\n= 450.52min = 27031.2\U0001D460\n=\
    \ 7ℎ 30min\n(9)\nIn a full turn, the pivot needs 7 hours and 30 minutes\napproximately\
    \ to water the 20ha. This allows for a sufficient\nnumber of irrigations per month\
    \ to cover for the needs\nof the crop (7). With the time required by the pivot,\
    \ the\nirrigation frequency of the pivot and the minimum flow rate\nare calculated.\
    \ To calculate the least flow rate feeding the\npivot, attention is paid to the\
    \ needs of the maize crop, the area\nunder cultivation, and the time available\
    \ for irrigation (value\nset at 18h), according to formula (5).\nThe pivot has\
    \ used 1002.06mm (1002.06l/m2-10020.6m3/\nha) over the time the corn crop was\
    \ cultivated, as shown in\nTable 6. These results were obtained with the traditional\
    \ pivot\nirrigation system.\nThe following are the changes brought about by the\n\
    architecture designed to achieve savings in the amount of\nwater used to irrigate\
    \ the crop. As shown in Figure 4, the\ngoal of optimizing the irrigation system\
    \ is to identify the\ncrop areas with greater and lesser irrigation needs; these\
    \ are\nidentified by the multiagent system (MAS) and the irrigation\nsystem supplies\
    \ water to these areas. Since each area is\ncharacterized by distinct features,\
    \ a set of different types of\nsensors is deployed in each one, in order to measure\
    \ different\nsoil, plant, and environmental parameters. Then, each area in\nthe\
    \ figure is identified by the MAS through a vector of values\ngiven by the sensors.\
    \ Once the feature values are obtained\nfor each area of the crop, the Agnes clustering\
    \ algorithm\n(Euclidean distance used as a metric in the data) is run by\nthe\
    \ MAS (KDVO virtual organization) to build similar area\nclusters. KDVO runs the\
    \ ULA agent by passing a dataset\nwith the feature of each area of the crop. The\
    \ ULA agent\nruns the Agnes clustering algorithm to identify different crop\n\
    subtypes; in this case, two subtypes of crops (irrigation and\nnonirrigation)\
    \ have been identified for all areas given in the\ninput dataset. Therefore, the\
    \ clustering algorithm will find\ntwo area groupings (clusters) with different\
    \ features: one\ngrouping may show that its areas need to be irrigated with\n\
    less or more water, whereas the other grouping can indicate\nthat they do not\
    \ require any irrigation. Then, once the areas\nhave been classified into two\
    \ groups (or more if needed),\nthis result is sent to the IMA agent through the\
    \ manager\nagent. The IMA agent encodes the result-clustering into a bit\nsequence\
    \ (a binary number), which associates each area of\nthe crop with its need for\
    \ irrigation. The IMA agent sends the\nbit sequence to the irrigation control\
    \ device, which interprets\nsuch a sequence as an order that becomes an irrigation\
    \ action\nfor the crop.\nThus, the goal of detecting similar area clusters is\
    \ to\nmanage and optimize the irrigation system. The MAS clusters\nsimilar areas\
    \ (in this case study, two types of area clusters) of\nthe crop to optimize the\
    \ water flow per area. In this case study,\nwe have selected two clusters, identifying\
    \ the areas that need\nmore or less water. Thus, the MAS builds a binary number\n\
    whose digits are related to each area. “1” means that the\ncorresponding area\
    \ needs irrigation while “0” means that no\nirrigation is necessary for that area.\
    \ Therefore, the irrigation\nsystem will just supply water (less or more water)\
    \ in areas with\nvalue “1” as shown in the irrigation system shown in Figure 4.\n\

    \ presented an architecture based on virtual\norganizations that allows localized\
    \ irrigation using a pivot.\nIt is an innovative approach that makes full use\
    \ of the\nadvantages of pivot irrigation (more economical choice)\nand the advantages\
    \ of localized irrigation (lower water con-\nsumption), eliminating the disadvantages\
    \ of pivot irrigation\n(higher water consumption vs. localized irrigation). The\
    \ use\nof a system of agents in this efficient water management\nproblem allowed\
    \ us to monitor the status of the corn crop\nand coordinate the pivot to irrigate\
    \ in localized areas releasing\nthe necessary amount of water. The hypothesis\
    \ proposed in\nthis study (that the consumption of water used for pivot\nirrigation\
    \ is similar to the amount of water required if\nthe localized irrigation method\
    \ is used) combines a series\nof needs (sensor data collection, fusion of information,\n\
    information processing, and decision making, among others)\nthat makes it necessary\
    \ to develop an architecture based\non an organization of virtual agents which\
    \ controls all the\nparameters that influence the irrigation decision (temper-\n\
    ature, humidity, wind, radiation, precipitation, soil salinity,\netc.) in a crop\
    \ by means of a WSN.\nAgent-based virtual organizations use data from the\nsensor\
    \ network deployed in the area of the case study crop.\nThe results showed that\
    \ the use of a VO MAS system was\nessential for optimizing the water used in crop\
    \ irrigation. The\npossibility of programming the pivot to irrigate allows the\n\
    VO MAS to send the architecture’s orders to the irrigation\nsystem, with the aim\
    \ of optimizing the amount of water used\nand the frequency of irrigation according\
    \ to the climatic\n12\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nTable 7:\

    \ From the results of the case study, we can\nsee that the performance of the\
    \ system allowed obtaining a\nreduction of 12.68% with respect to the crop area\
    \ that was\nmade by pivot but was not controlled by the VO MAS. Since\nthe percentage\
    \ was higher than 11%, we can deduce that\nthe MAS VOI achieves similar saving\
    \ to localized irrigation.\nHowever, MAS VOI does not entail the disadvantages\
    \ that\nlocalized irrigation does, for example, the difficulties in\nhaving to\
    \ deploy a distribution network in each harvest, the\ndifficulties when using\
    \ machinery on the surface of the crop,\nand the complication of deploying it\
    \ in large areas.\nFinally, automotive irrigation was used thanks to the\npossibility\
    \ of automating irrigation. It was even possible to\nirrigate only certain areas\
    \ of the crop surface if the architec-\nture decided so, according to the collected\
    \ data. Although\nlocalized irrigation consumes 11% less than automotive irri-\n\
    gation according to the literature, the fact that automotive\nirrigation was managed\
    \ by the architecture allowed us to\nobtain a higher optimization percentage.\
    \ Complementing\nthe above, we want to stress that, due to the ability of the\n\
    proposed architecture and its multiagent system to adapt and\nbe extensible, it\
    \ can be applied to other types of crops and\nwith a different geometry.\nData\

    Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including\
    \ aerospace,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other\
    \ hand, which employs\nthe latest technological innovations to optimize crop production,\
    \ is revolutionizing the\nagriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical\
    \ objects or systems, DTs represent a\nhighly promising advancement in this ﬁeld\
    \ [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable\nagriculture experts, researchers,\
    \ and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different\nstrategies, and predict\
    \ outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative\npossibilities,\
    \ revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization\n\
    of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop\
    \ yields for\na sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.\nHowever, despite\
    \ the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many\nquestions and\
    \ challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally labor-intensive\n\
    sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector in the last\
    \ decade, has\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167128\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n2 of 38\nbecome more complex and technologically advanced\
    \ in recent years, moving toward inno-\nvative technologies, particularly with\
    \ the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital\ntechnologies [5].\
    \ These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop\nmanagement,\
    \ soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,\n\
    enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies\n\
    can also require specialized knowledge and skills and signiﬁcant investment in\
    \ hardware,\nsoftware, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors\
    \ such as climate change,\nchanging consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations\
    \ can add to the complexity of\nmodern farming. While these challenges can make\
    \ farming more complicated, they also\noffer opportunities for innovation and\
    \ growth in the agriculture domain.\nIn this era of smart farming, the incorporation\
    \ of cutting-edge technologies such\nas computing, communication, personal and\
    \ cloud computing, the Internet of Things\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized\nthe landscape in agriculture.\
    \ These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the\nphysical realm,\
    \ allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of\nthe physical\
    \ structures involved. The concept of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing\n\
    comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the\
    \ limita-\ntions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging\
    \ real-time data\ncollection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation\
    \ of physical systems,\nenabling precise monitoring and forecasting of current\
    \ and future system states and re-\nbuilding existing models and re-design systems\
    \ and procedures. These advancements are\ninstrumental in transforming smart systems\
    \ and addressing the evolving challenges in the\nagricultural domain.\nThis review\
    \ paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the recent research\n\
    results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting key ﬁndings\
    \ and\nidentifying areas for future research. Speciﬁcally, we report and discuss\
    \ the various types\nof digital twins used in smart farming, such as crop, weather,\
    \ and soil models, and explore\nhow they optimize crop production. We also examine\
    \ the challenges and limitations\nof deploying DTs in smart farming related to\
    \ data management, model accuracy, and\nscalability. By providing a comprehensive\
    \ review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,\nthis paper aims to advance\
    \ the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the\ngaps in existing\
    \ deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation.\n\
    We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-\n\
    tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the\
    \ critical\ncomponents taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation\
    \ of such im-\nplementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing\
    \ technical aspects,\nled to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations\
    \ and related limitations that\nseem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although\
    \ the necessity of a DT model and\npractical implementations in agriculture is\
    \ addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning\nthe concept and deﬁnition, the\
    \ DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking\nsubstantial support\
    \ from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously\nevolving, authors\
    \ refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-\nplementation.\
    \ Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates\n\
    DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by\
    \ mere\ntelemetry implementations.\nThe structure of this study proceeds as follows:\
    \ Section 2 delves into the concept of\nDTs and investigates their usage in the\
    \ realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses the\nchallenges and confronting\
    \ measures regarding DT building components and relevant\ntechnologies. In Section\
    \ 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed, while\nconclusions\
    \ and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6,\nfuture directions for research and development are outlined respectively.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n3 of 38\n2. The Deﬁnition of Digital Twins\nThe fundamental\
    \ concept of a DT, which involves a connected virtual representation\nof a physical\
    \ object or system [6], appears to be relatively straightforward. However, its\n\
    application and implementation can differ significantly across various domains\
    \ and industries.\nAlthough it is quite clear that in addition to their core purpose\
    \ of modelling real-\nworld systems, DTs are designed to empower individuals to\
    \ make informed business\ndecisions with tangible impacts on the physical realm,\
    \ a clear deﬁnition of the DT concept\nmay be helpful to distinguish it from related\
    \ concepts such as simulation, modelling, and\ndata analytics. By deﬁning its\
    \ scope, characteristics, and capabilities, researchers and\npractitioners can\
    \ better identify the speciﬁc features and requirements that make a system\na\
    \ true DT.\n2.1. Deﬁnition of Digital Twins—What Does Digital Twins Term Stand\
    \ For?\nThe deﬁnition of DTs emerged in the early 2000s by Michael Grieves [6]\
    \ while evolving\nto a widely acceptable DT concept model where they act as a\
    \ bridge connecting physical\nentities in the real world with their virtual complements\
    \ in a digital environment, closing\nthe gap between the two. They establish vital\
    \ connections between data and information\nto seamlessly integrate these products’\
    \ virtual and real aspects [6,7]. The convergence\nof virtual and physical entities\
    \ in a virtual space and the real world lays the foundation\nfor creating a fundamental\
    \ DT model. By fostering dynamic interplay between these\ntangible and virtual\
    \ elements, the DT is a powerful representation of the combined physical-\nvirtual\
    \ system.\nMashaly M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical\
    \ systems and are\norganized by establishing data connections. This transformation\
    \ enables physical systems\nto exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization\
    \ between their physical and digital\ncounterparts. As a result, smooth interactions\
    \ and data exchange occur between the two\ndomains. The integration of the physical\
    \ and virtual domains provides valuable insights,\npredictive abilities, and the\
    \ potential for optimizing system performance following the\npattern illustrated\

    \ in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1. The generic representation of a DT scheme’s dynamic\
    \ integration of physical and digital \ndomains. \nFigure 1. The generic representation\
    \ of a DT scheme’s dynamic integration of physical and digital domains.\nAccording\
    \ to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s pioneering\nwork\
    \ in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze intricate\
    \ systems.\nOriginally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded\
    \ to encompass\nproduct lifecycle management across diverse industries. At its\
    \ core, as initially proposed\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n4 of 38\nby Grieves & Vickers\
    \ [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-\ntal representation,\
    \ and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for\nboth\
    \ ways.\nOngoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and\
    \ integration\nas interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing,\
    \ IoT, and Industry 4.0,\nwhere explicitly stated that the provided response is\
    \ a unique formulation based on the\ngiven information [13,14].\nHence, DTs serve\
    \ as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor\ndata and\
    \ serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout\n\
    various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data\
    \ integration,\nDTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the\
    \ characteristics and\nbehaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables\
    \ continuous real-time monitoring,\nanalysis, and enhancement of the physical\
    \ objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-\nmance, efﬁciency, and informed\
    \ decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].\nDTs utilize actual\
    \ data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and\nsimulation\
    \ combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-\n\
    making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities,\
    \ including\ndevices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of\
    \ the IoT has spurred\nthe advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse\
    \ domains and use cases support-\ning simulation, optimization, and prediction.\
    \ Thus, major improvement steps have been\ntaken in the realm of decision-making\
    \ so that various sectors, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, and smart cities,\
    \ have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-\nverse technologies\
    \ like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling\nand\
    \ simulation [4,13,15,16].\nTo simulate and model the physical system to succeed\
    \ in implementing the DTs, the\nuse of mathematical models is mandatory [17].\
    \ Once the observed physical phenomena of\ninterest are captured, foundational\
    \ mathematical equations are formulated to depict and\ncharacterize the dynamics\
    \ of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-\nical models,\
    \ researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior\n\
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that\
    \ are\ndeveloped need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in\
    \ laboratory setups\nto verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration\
    \ soundly. Therefore,\nin advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization\
    \ of extensive datasets to establish\ndata-driven models. This approach operates\
    \ under the assumption that the data obtained\nfrom the system serves as a powerful\
    \ source of insight, offering profound revelations about\nits physical behavior.\
    \ As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data\nto construct\
    \ accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the\n\
    system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and\
    \ its digital\nrepresentation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.\nBy using\
    \ AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while\nutilizing\

    \ Adopting semantic\ntechnologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs is crucial\

    \ solution for the complex task of pro-\ncessing vast amounts of data in various\
    \ sectors, particularly in conjunction with the advent\nof the Industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT). The IIoT, a subset of the IoT speciﬁcally designed for industrial\n\
    applications, involves deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems\
    \ to\nenable real-time data processing after collection and sensing. Given the\
    \ nature of industrial\nenvironments, IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure\
    \ and robust communication\nto ensure optimal production performance [22]. IIoT\
    \ applications that connect machines,\nsensors, and actuators like data collected\
    \ from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for\neffective decision-making\
    \ and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume\nof non-uniform\
    \ data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide\nconnectivity\
    \ between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to\n\
    previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze\n\
    such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,\n\
    production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to\
    \ ensure data\nsecurity and communication security within the IIoT systems. A\
    \ data breach in such IIoT\nsystems could compromise agricultural production,\
    \ i.e., crop health degradation, transport\nand product processing, leading to\
    \ inferior production performance [23].\nThe exponential growth of IIoT and its\
    \ associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-\ntributed to the advancement of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the\nunderlying framework\
    \ for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices\nplay a vital\
    \ role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-\n\
    ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to\
    \ address\noutstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full\
    \ potential and achieve\nits envisioned advantages.\nCDT systems integrate data\
    \ from different stakeholders as they combine several\nparameters, mainly concerning\
    \ immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures\nto ensure security, privacy,\
    \ and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.\nCDTs incorporate\
    \ cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms\nto address\
    \ these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate\n\
    transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and\
    \ facilitate\nintegrated development processes [8,24].\nSimilarly, the notion\
    \ of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-\nprise, encompassing\
    \ its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support\nstrategic\
    \ decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within\
    \ the\norganization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This\
    \ type of DT which\nretrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting\
    \ operational data within an\norganization, as mentioned earlier, is referred\
    \ to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the\nindustrial DT that gathers information\
    \ from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization\ntool that allows managers\
    \ to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time\nconstraints.\
    \ By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers\n\
    can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the\
    \ real world.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n7 of 38\n2.2. DTs in Agriculture\nAs stated\
    \ above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.\n\
    The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following\
    \ manner.\nA DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual\
    \ model of a physical\nfarm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies like sensors,\nIoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize\
    \ the DT to simulate and enhance\ntheir farming methods within a virtual setting,\
    \ enabling them to reﬁne their practices before\napplying them in reality [26,27].\
    \ Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs\nin agriculture,\
    \ encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features\nof\
    \ DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage\
    \ in\nagriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting\
    \ data,\nautonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized\
    \ services\nto individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT\
    \ enables capturing\nreal-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions,\
    \ ambient temperatures, and even\nsoil moisture levels as various environmental\
    \ and operational factors. A dynamic model of\nthe farm may be created by using\
    \ this data to test different scenarios and optimize various\naspects of the farming\
    \ operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-\nciency.\
    \ By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices\
    \ impact\nthe environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.\
    \ They can\nalso use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision\
    \ agriculture and\nautomation, before investing in them for their physical operation.\
    \ Instances of DTs in the\nagricultural sector spanning across various domains\
    \ ﬁnd applications in diverse areas such\nas crop cultivation, dairy production,\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming,\nplant disease analysis,\
    \ livestock management, food supply chain optimization, as well as\nfarm machinery\
    \ and building management, including ﬂeet monitoring and control [9].\nThe schematic\

    \ farmers to optimize their farming prac-\ntices and improve the efficiency and\
    \ sustainability of their operations. Through the rapid \nadvancement of technology\
    \ and sensor capabilities, the DT of agricultural soil can revo-\nlutionize plant\

    \ Farmers can effectively observe and evaluate alterations\nin agricultural land,\
    \ impacting soil, irrigation, and crop yield. IoT technology provides\nreal-time\
    \ data and visual representations for informed decision-making [29].\nThe overall\
    \ efﬁciency of crop production can be improved by reducing costs associated\n\
    with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors affecting production efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability\nmerely by utilizing DTs in crop production technologies along\
    \ with the use of Digital\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) tools,\
    \ referring to agricultural pieces of\nmachinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters,\
    \ fertilizers, and sprayers.\nAccording to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to\
    \ ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,\nencompassing the various stages involved\
    \ in handling agricultural products after harvest-\ning. These products must be\
    \ dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing\nprocedures. Digital\
    \ farming methods provide advantages in post-harvest procedures, such\nas minimizing\
    \ losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions, stream-\n\
    lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate\
    \ the\nlive tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased\
    \ robustness,\nresilience and reduced food waste and losses.\nIoT technology following\
    \ the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role\nin transforming\
    \ traditional agriculture into a more efﬁcient and sustainable practice. IoT\n\
    contextual data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and\
    \ remote lo-\ncations through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity\
    \ and user experiences [1].\nFacts such as precision agriculture that enables\
    \ farmers to gather real-time data on\na range of environmental and operational\
    \ factors, predictive modelling by using both\nhistorical and real-time data so\
    \ that they can generate a dynamic virtual representation of\ntheir agricultural\
    \ operation, sustainability, and automation to identify ways to reduce waste\n\
    and improve sustainability in farming operations [30] in accordance to real-time\
    \ data, focus\non addressing critical IoT needs such as two-way communication,\
    \ comprehensive security\nmeasures, localization, and mobility services to optimize\
    \ its efﬁciency and effectiveness [31].\nIn addition, DTs seem to pose a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in animal farming or precision livestock\nfarming by enhancing productivity,\
    \ animal welfare, and overall farm management. They\ncan be used to create virtual\
    \ representations of individual animals, groups of animals, or\nentire livestock\
    \ production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior, growth,\nand\
    \ health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early signs\
    \ of disease or\ndistress, and improve overall animal welfare.\nThrough data-driven\
    \ insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed\ndecisions regarding\
    \ nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating\nup-to-the-minute\
    \ information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring\ndevices,\
    \ and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,\n\
    and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance.\nNeethirajan S. [33] presents\
    \ a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and esti-\nmate livestock’s\
    \ emotional state and behavior. Various means of communication, including\nvocalizations,\
    \ body movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals\nexpressing\
    \ their emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering\n\
    extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing\
    \ a sensor\ndata processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves\
    \ preliminary data\nprocessing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting\
    \ in reporting and pre-\ndicting the emotional states of cattle based on their\
    \ tail movements, facial expressions, and\nbody posture. Traditional methods involving\
    \ blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the\nemotional states of livestock\
    \ usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being\ntime-consuming,\
    \ and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI\n\
    technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers\
    \ and\nethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being\
    \ and productivity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n9 of 38\nDTs may support decision-making\
    \ and farm management optimization by simulating\ndifferent scenarios regarding\
    \ environmental conditions or genetic factors on animal perfor-\nmance and production\
    \ outcomes while improving production efﬁciency and minimizing\nenvironmental\
    \ impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as\nfarm\
    \ management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing\
    \ for\nseamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing\
    \ traceability, quality\nassurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.\n\
    In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by\n\
    providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They\
    \ can\noptimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting\
    \ sustainable\nfarming practices. Continued research and development in this area\
    \ will be crucial to fully\nharness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address\
    \ the associated challenges.\nAn Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based\
    \ intelligent ﬁsh farm man-\nagement system for precision aquaculture is discussed\
    \ in [34], addressing the design\nconsiderations, data integration, analytics,\
    \ and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm\noperations. The proposed implementation\
    \ utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing\nML realizations, computer vision,\
    \ and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to\nmonitor and control automated\
    \ aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production\nin various environments\
    \ throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims\nto maximize\
    \ efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to\n\
    monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and\
    \ RGB or sonar\ncamera devices may collect environmental data and data related\
    \ to ﬁsh populations to es-\ntablish data-driven prediction models. On the other\
    \ hand, land-based monitoring systems\nsend appropriate commands to activate surveillance\
    \ sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding\nbehavior monitoring, disease spread, and\
    \ ﬁsh population growth.\nFurthermore, DTs address optimization solutions regarding\
    \ water ﬂow and treatment\nprocesses related to water quality reduction following\
    \ ﬂoods and stormwater within trans-\nboundary water security projects due to\
    \ urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed\nto monitor the quality of urban\
    \ water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sen-\nsors in urban drainage\
    \ systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil,\nvegetation,\
    \ clogging, and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables\n\
    comprehensive monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management\n\
    and maintenance.\n3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components\nAlthough\
    \ the implementation of DTs in agriculture can vary in complexity and scope\n\
    based on the speciﬁc architecture of the DT scheme, in Figure 5, a representative\

    \ schematic in Figure 5 highlights the key components and interactions of digital\n\
    twins in agriculture, showcasing their role in data collection, preprocessing,\
    \ modelling,\nsimulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control,\
    \ ultimately aiding in\noptimizing farm operations and improving decision-making\
    \ processes.\nFurthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital\
    \ role as they are\nessential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated\
    \ manner, as emphasized by\nPedersen et al. in their research [17].\n3.1. Technologies\
    \ Involved in DTs\nTherefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several\
    \ deﬁning keys that have\nemerged along with key technologies [1] from various\
    \ domains, industries, and scientiﬁc\ndisciplines that pose a decisive entity,\
    \ such as the following.\n3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality\nDTs rely\
    \ on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As\nan\
    \ example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented\n\
    as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft\n\
    HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can\
    \ be generated\nand projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables\
    \ individuals in different\nlocations to engage in interactions that simulate\
    \ being physically present in the same space.\nCommunication enhancement in digital\
    \ twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,\nsimulating the sensation\
    \ of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage\nhumanoid\
    \ and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their\
    \ real-\nlife counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with\
    \ the environment\nor perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like\
    \ or ﬂexible movements.\nThese advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality,\
    \ haptics, and robotics greatly en-\nhance the capabilities of digital twins,\
    \ enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,\nand physical engagement,\
    \ expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n11 of 38\n3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a\nkey advantage\
    \ of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-\n\
    prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights\
    \ faster\nthan human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital\
    \ twin’s surroundings\nand physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable\
    \ conclusions [36]. As an\nemerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit\
    \ intelligent behaviors, including\nbehavioral learning. By amalgamating various\
    \ technologies, including AI, to create twin\nmodels of physical objects, it becomes\
    \ feasible to generate virtual representations that\nclosely resemble the original\
    \ objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive\ninformation [37].\
    \ As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,\n\
    and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly\
    \ processes IoT\ndata through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated\
    \ user data. Leverag-\ning such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential\
    \ to suggest actions for controlling or\nmitigating potentially hazardous situations\
    \ regarding crop health and productivity, in cases\nsuch as droughts to direct\
    \ asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms\nof farm machinery,\
    \ plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage\nequipment\
    \ situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even\
    \ take\nimmediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of\
    \ crop production [29].\n3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes\nDTs rely\
    \ on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the\n\
    environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is\
    \ particularly\nsigniﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication\
    \ must occa-\nsionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating\
    \ compliance with 5G and\ntactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and\
    \ safety-critical schemes, coupled with\nthe need for stringent communication\
    \ standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable\nand cost-effective veriﬁcation\
    \ procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window\nbecomes crucial\
    \ for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency\n\
    limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs\
    \ outline\nbasic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.\n\
    (a)\nRFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor\
    \ tags, reader\nantennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit,\
    \ and a substrate utilize\na tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading\
    \ or writing. The reader antennas\ncommunicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating\
    \ data transfer to the database\nsystem. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications\
    \ in storage and inventory man-\nagement, supply chain monitoring, access control,\
    \ aviation transportation, agriculture,\nhealthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency\
    \ and automation in various ﬁelds [39].\n(b)\nWireless Networks, in particular,\
    \ suggest an immense role in sending data from\na source to a connected gateway,\
    \ a role supported by a variety of wireless net-\nwork technologies such as WPAN,\
    \ WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed\nin [18,39–47]. The existing commercial\
    \ 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-\ning the transmission of data packets\
    \ through the well-established Internet Protocol\n(IP), serves as a base to sustain\
    \ the architecture of wireless communication networks\nin general.\ni\nWireless\
    \ Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate\nwith less\
    \ extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a\nlimited range,\
    \ typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional\nnetworks\
    \ that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-\nvices nearby,\
    \ facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or\nmice to computers\
    \ and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN\ntechnologies include\
    \ Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and\nRFID, each employing different\
    \ techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n12 of\
    \ 38\nBluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within\
    \ a\nlimited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used\
    \ in a\nwide variety of devices [41].\nii\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\
    \ are wireless networks that allow de-\nvices to connect and communicate over\
    \ a local area without the need for\nphysical cables within a speciﬁc coverage\
    \ area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public\nspace. These networks utilize the widely\
    \ recognized IEEE 802.11 standard,\ncommonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices\
    \ like smartphones, laptops, and\ntablets to enable wireless interconnection between\
    \ them and connection to\nthe internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced\
    \ in 1997, using\nthe 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data\
    \ transmission\nrates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4\
    \ GHz and 5 GHz\nbands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple\
    \ users, with\na minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs,\
    \ span-\nning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale\n\
    wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-\nnectivity\
    \ for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle\nsharing,\
    \ video streaming, and more.\niii\nWireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide\
    \ wireless connectivity on\na larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even\
    \ entire countries. WWAN\ntechnologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\
    \ 5G, and the evolving\n6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support\
    \ a wide range of\nservices, including voice communication, video streaming, and\
    \ data transfer.\nThese networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly\
    \ used for\nmobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected\
    \ while\non the go.\niv\nLow Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network\
    \ technologies\nideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,\
    \ and low cost.\nUnlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily\
    \ designed\nfor high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs\
    \ target\nenergy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity\
    \ in\nindustrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,\n\
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense\nurban\
    \ areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life\nexceeding\
    \ ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that\nrequire small-scale\
    \ data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have\nbeen developed and\
    \ deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,\nsuch as Long-Range\
    \ (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing\ndifferent techniques to achieve\
    \ the goals of LPWAN [49].\n•\nLoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology\
    \ for low-bandwidth\nIoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption\
    \ ser-\nvices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-\n\
    range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz\nISM band\
    \ available worldwide [50].\n•\nNB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting\
    \ various devices\nand services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow\
    \ band-\nwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.\n\
    Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes\n\
    LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-\nisting\
    \ with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and\nleverages\
    \ compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].\nThe main technical features\
    \ of the wireless network technologies mentioned above are\ndisplayed in Table\

    \ needs, is open, and is used in arti-\ncles [25,39–42,44]. In cases where the\
    \ application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth\ntechnology can be used,\
    \ as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher\npower consumption\
    \ compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and\n200 m for\
    \ Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection,\
    \ such\nas products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID\
    \ technology is a\nsuitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications\
    \ that require a high data rate\nand need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision\
    \ of electrical power is necessary. Finally,\nonce DTs rely on data exchange,\
    \ real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical\ncounterparts, wireless\
    \ networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication\nfor these purposes\
    \ [8].\n3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility\nReliability, integrity,\
    \ and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive\ntasks involving\
    \ transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-\native\
    \ for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities\
    \ and\nactions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin\
    \ and the DT is\ncrucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable\
    \ decision-making, and ensuring\nsecure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation\
    \ of trust becomes indispensable\nfor the successful operation and advancement\
    \ of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,\nprivacy and security arise as paramount\
    \ considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the\nconﬁdentiality and privacy\
    \ of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for\nidentity protection.\
    \ This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and\nadvanced biometric\
    \ techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these\ntechniques,\
    \ the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.\n\
    In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security,\
    \ and privacy.\nMeasures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and\
    \ interception of data across\nthe network. Unauthorized users should be promptly\
    \ detected and repelled to prevent any\ncompromise of data integrity or security.\
    \ To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data\nsources, rigorous measures\
    \ for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-\ning the data\
    \ into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy\n\
    and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ and\nintegrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric\
    \ techniques,\nand implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can\
    \ effectively address privacy\nand security concerns, fostering a trustworthy\
    \ and secure environment for the real twins\nand their digital counterparts.\n\
    3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain\nIn recent times, Distributed\
    \ Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],\nhave emerged to add\
    \ to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To\nunlock\
    \ its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding\n\
    concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized\
    \ approach\nthat eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing\
    \ it from traditional\ndata-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system\
    \ allows for the secure sharing\nof data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance\
    \ of DLT has garnered considerable\ninterest from researchers and practitioners\
    \ alike. Various systems and platforms based\non Distributed Ledger Technology\
    \ (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and\npermissioned ledgers, have\
    \ been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].\nProposed\
    \ technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put\nforward\
    \ to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food\n\
    supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n15 of 38\nprocesses [55]. Given the numerous advantages\
    \ associated with DLT, it presents itself as a\npromising technology that can\
    \ signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.\nBlockchain technologies,\
    \ in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating\nusers, storing\
    \ data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and\n\
    decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.\n\
    It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries.\
    \ Each\npreceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated\
    \ through a distributed\nconsensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain\
    \ ensures data integrity\nand prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain\
    \ scheme, provides an alternative\nprotocol for decentralized applications that,\
    \ unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is\nnot just a payment network but\
    \ also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.\nIt uses its digital\
    \ currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-\nguage\
    \ (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on\
    \ the\nblockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central\
    \ authority are\ncalled Smart contracts [57].\nOn the other hand, the Helium Blockchain\
    \ is referred to as the major public decen-\ntralized LoRaWAN network in the world,\
    \ that enables devices anywhere in the world\nto wirelessly connect to the internet\
    \ and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without\nthe need for energy-consuming\
    \ satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].\nHelium offers low\
    \ transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end\nencryption,\
    \ which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.\nThe use of blockchain,\
    \ such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for\nsmart agriculture\
    \ applications has the following advantages:\n•\nTransparency and trust: Blockchain\
    \ provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof\ndistributed ledger, allowing\
    \ all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can\nhelp build trust\
    \ among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and prevent\nfraud\
    \ or unauthorized interventions.\n•\nBlockchain enhances Data security [59] as\
    \ it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This\nis crucial for safeguarding\
    \ sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as\ndata on plant health,\
    \ soil quality, and food production.\n•\nAutomation and smart contracts on the\
    \ blockchain enable programmable automatic\nexecution of conditions and actions\
    \ based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-\ntions such as automated irrigation,\
    \ temperature control, and plant health monitoring\nin smart agriculture.\n•\n\
    The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored\
    \ and\nveriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity\
    \ of\ndata and reducing dependency on a central authority.\n3.1.6. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability\n\
    and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging\
    \ cloud\ncomputing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ from the local\nenvironment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex\
    \ processes and ensure\nseamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs\
    \ is signiﬁcantly improved through\ncloud computing, as the computational resources\
    \ can be dynamically allocated and scaled\nbased on demand. This allows DTs to\
    \ handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD), per-\nform sophisticated\
    \ analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware\nlimitations.\
    \ As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that\n\
    closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition,\
    \ storage,\nand processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive\
    \ volume of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other\
    \ data-generating components [7],\nfacts that necessitate cloud computing. The\
    \ elastic nature of cloud computing ensures\nthat DTs can adapt to varying workloads\
    \ and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in\ncomputational requirements.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n16 of 38\nFurthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of\
    \ ubiquitous accessibility by using\nopen-source communication platforms, such\
    \ as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-\nnication protocol and frameworks, for\
    \ data exchange from sensors to cloud applications\nused in DTs. Real twins can\
    \ access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any\ntime, provided\
    \ an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile\n\
    environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless\
    \ of their\nphysical location.\n3.1.7. Internet of Things\nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have\nemerged as\
    \ groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with\ntheir\
    \ focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication\n\
    paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for\
    \ applica-\ntions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal\
    \ delays and seamless\nintegration of communication and control mechanisms as\
    \ demanded in DT infrastructure.\nWithin this context, DTs play a pivotal role\
    \ by establishing a continuously operational twin\nfeedback loop, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This\nseamless real-time feedback\
    \ communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,\nanalyze, and adapt to\
    \ the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a\nresult,\
    \ precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the\nphysical systems’ overall service quality and performance.\nThrough the\
    \ IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while\nreceiving\
    \ feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,\n\
    both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required\
    \ to\ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity\
    \ to the data entity,\nenabling seamless connectivity and communication between\
    \ connected devices [17], as\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n17\

    \ are required to \ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical\

    \ entities over an IoT platform overview. \nThe capabilities of DTs are enhanced\
    \ by contextual data, and the IoT serves as a pow-\nerful conduit for feeding\
    \ such data from users to their DTs and vice versa. This exchange \nof information\
    \ enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, whether in \n\
    close proximity or at remote locations. Additionally, digital twins can provide\
    \ valuable \nfeedback to the environment, further enriching the user experience\
    \ and enabling a more \nintegrated and interconnected ecosystem.  \n3.1.8. Modelling\

    \ and interconnected ecosystem.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n17 of 38\n3.1.8. Modelling\
    \ and Simulation Software\nA DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)\
    \ an object model, in conjunction\nwith (ii) an expansive set of data that is\
    \ directly following the object that may evolve,\nand ﬁnally, (iii) a method for\
    \ modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available\ndata [17,62]. The experts\
    \ decide the need and selection of the training, validation and\nveriﬁcation data\
    \ concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant\n\
    height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data\
    \ processing\ndepends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated\
    \ sensors, ML and\nDL applicable methods and big data analytics software.\nOne\
    \ of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately\n\
    depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of\
    \ dynamic\nand evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend\
    \ the application\nof a validated model across timescales during which the object\
    \ and its behavior undergo\nsigniﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer\
    \ an instant representation of an object’s\nbehavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus\
    \ highlighting the importance of associating the DT with\na corresponding physical\
    \ counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according\nto the speciﬁc\
    \ implementation.\nWithout a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing\
    \ more than a model.\nFurthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date\
    \ dataset plays a crucial\nrole in accurately capturing the object’s changes over\
    \ time and ensuring the model is\nadjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system\
    \ conditions. Any model approximating\nthe physical twinned can be used for DTs\
    \ that utilize physics-based models encompassing\nall relevant processes that\
    \ can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with\ninstantaneous\
    \ computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate\nand\
    \ update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations.\
    \ For\ninstance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering\
    \ factors\nlike temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information\
    \ about tool wear\nbased on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and\
    \ effective industrial plant\nfacilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency\
    \ [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant\nin agriculture, a digital model\
    \ could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that are changing over time.\nAccording to researchers, a categorization\
    \ standard centered around the degree of\ndata fusion and integration between\
    \ the PO and its virtual representation can be used as\nan indicator to deﬁne\
    \ and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term\nwas initially\
    \ created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating\n\
    agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary\n\
    deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld.\
    \ First is the\nDigital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third\
    \ is the DT. The DM is a\ndepiction of the entity in a digital format without\
    \ the use of an automated data transfer\nsystem. It is equivalent to a Digital\
    \ Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible\nintegration level. The DS\
    \ refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic\nexchange of information\
    \ from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes\nin the entity’s\
    \ state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,\n\
    involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS,\
    \ the DT has a\nvirtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical\
    \ entity’s state. However,\nwhat sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the\
    \ condition of the physical entity as well,\nalthough the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence\
    \ depend on the type of entity and its context [63].\nIn summary, a DM represents\
    \ a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-\nmated data exchange.\
    \ A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital\ncounterpart\
    \ originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and\n\
    fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the\
    \ physical\nsystem and the physical system itself.\nDeﬁning the objectives of\
    \ the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model\nfor an integrated\
    \ process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n18 of 38\nessential, as diverse objectives can provide different\
    \ levels of complexity in representing\nthe actual procedure. For this reason,\
    \ it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the\nbuild [64]. Therefore,\
    \ complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed\nand objectively\
    \ deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as\nMicrosoft\
    \ Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is\n\
    due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and other\nprofessionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and\
    \ still emerging. The\nspreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations,\
    \ and produce results\nwhile they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software\
    \ programs like process\nsimulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated\
    \ processes. The purpose of\nthese tools is to simulate continuous processes and\
    \ their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc\nliterature concerning process simulation\
    \ tools is continuously growing, encompassing\nvarious areas such as techno-economic\
    \ analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural\nprocess enhancements, and\
    \ the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].\nGiven that\
    \ a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an\n\
    exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different\
    \ objectives\nmay produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of\
    \ detail concerning the\nactual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of\
    \ the model before we develop it.\nSince cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it\
    \ is the most practical method for introduc-\ning DT services. Due to its ability\
    \ to provide on-demand services, computational resources,\nand ubiquitous network\
    \ access, the implementation of the next-generation information\ntechnology architecture\
    \ is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,\ndata owners\
    \ generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in\
    \ a\nvirtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the\
    \ simulation\nwith the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any\
    \ time [59]. In construct-\ning complex DT production systems, like industrial\
    \ or agricultural systems, “machine\nlearning” and “simulation tools” are two\
    \ complementary technologies. Creating stochastic\nsimulations for complicated\
    \ systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations\nare essential for\
    \ DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is\n“uncertainty\
    \ modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML\nand\
    \ reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital\
    \ twin use\ncases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing\
    \ technologies\nhas signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It\
    \ is widely believed that digital\ntwins will soon become a vital catalyst for\
    \ digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-\nmon theme present in various\
    \ research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing\na secure, reliable\
    \ method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a\nneed\
    \ for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts\
    \ of\nblockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.\n\
    3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations\nIn the realm of digital twins,\
    \ components denote the distinct constituents or elements\nthat constitute a digital\
    \ twin system. A representative ensemble follows.\n3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators\n\
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable\n\
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory\n\
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and\
    \ actuators\nare deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products\
    \ to industrial set-\ntings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors\
    \ capture critical information\nrelated to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,\
    \ chemical components, and material\ncomposition, forming the foundation for digital\
    \ twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real\ntwins (physical entities) with sensors,\
    \ DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,\ntemperature, sound, humidity,\
    \ and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,\nin the agricultural domain,\
    \ a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7128\n19 of 38\nmaintenance services or simulate and optimize the production\
    \ process. This allows for the\ngeneration of actionable insights and the enhancement\
    \ of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on\nthe integration of actuator and sensor\
    \ technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.\nThe representation of\
    \ a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,\nrelies on\
    \ the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based\n\
    counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators,\
    \ aggregating\ndata from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within\
    \ the digital twin\nframework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics,\
    \ and the ability to simulate\nvarious scenarios for optimization purposes. By\
    \ bridging the physical and digital realms,\ndigital twins empower industries\
    \ and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased\nefﬁciency, and cost\
    \ savings.\n3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities\nIn the context of DTs, each twin\
    \ is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless\ncommunication with\
    \ its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital\ninformation\
    \ about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,\n\
    as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a\
    \ DT, it is\ncrucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure\
    \ an accurate represen-\ntation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical,\
    \ they may exhibit different behaviors\nwhen subjected to varying conditions.\
    \ Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-\ntiﬁer, reﬂecting the\
    \ individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical\nobject.\
    \ By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze\
    \ its\nproperties and behaviours.\nFurthermore, the expansive network of interconnected\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators\nhighlights the need for real-time collection\
    \ and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with\ndigital twins. This data encompasses\
    \ various parameters such as location, environmen-\ntal conditions, user preferences,\
    \ and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely\nidentiﬁed contextual\
    \ data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context\nand needs\
    \ can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System\n(GIS)\
    \ as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types\
    \ and\nlinks IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred\
    \ to as spatial\ndata, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for\
    \ mapping and analysis utilized\nacross multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\
    \ With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,\nrelationships, and the geographical\
    \ context of their data, as in [68].\n3.2.3. Visualization and Representation\n\
    Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms\n\
    of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage\
    \ 3D\nvisualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending\
    \ on the context,\nthese connections can manifest in various forms, such as a\
    \ 3D representation, hologram,\nhumanoid social robot, or purely as software components\
    \ without physical attendance.\nConsequently, DT commonly refers to the digital\
    \ depiction of a real-world object, system, or\nentity’s physical twin that faithfully\
    \ replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,\nor even a legendary\
    \ narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital\ntwins merge.\
    \ These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,\n\
    necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition,\
    \ ﬂexibility,\nsensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ predictions suggest that\nfuture DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world\
    \ [70].\n3.2.4. Devices\nDevices that continuously capture data concerning physiological\
    \ and environmental\nfactors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real\ntwin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices,\
    \ for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness\ntrackers, and other health monitoring devices\
    \ have enabled individuals to collect and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n20 of 38\n\
    track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data\
    \ presents\na unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for\
    \ their real twins more\nefﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables\
    \ into the DT model, real-time\ninsights and personalized recommendations can\
    \ be generated as feedback or alerts based on\nspeciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore,\
    \ the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable\ndata by DTs enable proactive\
    \ interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from\nnormal physiological\
    \ parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address\npotential\
    \ health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute\
    \ to\npreventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being\
    \ management.\nIn summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates\
    \ 3D ani-\nmation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables\
    \ the seamless con-\nnection and management of physical and virtual models within\
    \ a digital environment [72].\nAs human civilization grows, agriculture remains\
    \ crucial for our progress and well-being.\nIntelligent DT systems can analyze\
    \ and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and\nmicro-level visual processes.\
    \ These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and\nsuggestions that\
    \ can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.\n4. Reviewing\

    \ address the signiﬁcance of a DT case study in\nagriculture. The concept of DTs\
    \ is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers\nthough [19,26–28,64,73,82],\
    \ the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus\nposing the signiﬁcance\
    \ of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.\nAccording to the reviewed literature\
    \ summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an\nimplementation of agriculture 4.0\
    \ [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation\nstrategies by monitoring\
    \ and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data\nacquisition\
    \ techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture\
    \ or\neven in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation,\
    \ monitoring,\ncontrolling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural\
    \ sites [87], DTs\nimprove predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88],\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and\norganic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart\
    \ farming enhances remote detection and\nmonitoring of vegetation and crop stress\
    \ in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and\nforecasting plant yield in greenhouses,\
    \ vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in\nurban and indoor farming,\
    \ of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-\nculture, and\
    \ aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the\n\
    sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management\
    \ [75,76]\nvia the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ [27,29,64], leading the\nway to digital representations of plants [9], inventory\
    \ quality in agriculture, greenhouse\nproduction ﬂow, and food safety and quality\
    \ within the food supply chain [45]. Although\nthe DTs remain a major issue in\
    \ our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are\nimplied as such.\
    \ In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed\n\
    as a signiﬁcant future issue to address and study.\n4.2. The Second Categorization\

    DTs go along with monitoring systems to gather and analyze information. Sensors\n\
    pose a critical role in smart agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time\
    \ data and\noffering valuable insights into a wide range of environmental and\
    \ agricultural parameters.\nField or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil moisture,\nand ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2\
    \ sensors measuring relative CO2 con-\ncentration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers\
    \ provide data acquisition modules for\nautomatically controlled actuator systems\
    \ in agriculture approaching digital modelling\nto the food process [64] monitoring\
    \ activities of livestock, optimization of crops, reducing\nemissions to air,\
    \ soil, and water. Drone image cameras [88] and high-resolution photo-\ngraphic\
    \ cameras seem ideal for AR and VR by constructing virtual natural low-polygon\n\
    3D plant models as proposed in [35,74]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) models\
    \ of\nhigh-tech data-driven greenhouses are made feasible as in [79] and provide\
    \ a VR presenta-\ntion of the farm or ﬁeld with the aid of a head-mounted display\
    \ (HMD) with two handheld\ncontrollers serving as handy sensors for manual stimulus.\

    \ IoT\nsensor nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge\
    \ devices, thus\ncultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse\
    \ production process and\nﬁnally models in sustainable agriculture.\nRemote detection\
    \ and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem\nfeasible based\
    \ on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-\nspectral\
    \ imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-\n\
    crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].\n\
    Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthe remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions\
    \ in agriculture [88].\nIoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware\
    \ communication pro-\ntocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous\
    \ serial communication\nwith conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM)\
    \ for driving actuators [77,81],\nin correlation with programmable logic controllers\
    \ (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-\ning, and optimization aided occasionally\
    \ by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].\nThe decision-making and actions once\
    \ undertaken by the farmers now have given\nway to data-driven agricultural decision-making,\
    \ i.e., assisting them to undertake informed\ndecisions related to planting, fertilization,\
    \ pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-\nagement. Likewise, derived\
    \ from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]\na hands-on approach\
    \ is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on\nIoT technology\
    \ for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.\n4.3. The\
    \ Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical\n\
    Research Aspects\nDTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their\
    \ physical counterparts. The\nsoftware component of a DT enables the collection,\
    \ processing, and analysis of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, actuators,\
    \ and other connected devices.\nIn [28,77], the high-level programming language\
    \ Python is used for software develop-\nment, scripting, and data analysis, serving\
    \ the purposes of DT applications, implementing\nthe Arduino IDE platform, and\
    \ exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-\ntion model. Likewise,\
    \ RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented\nrequirement\
    \ language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open\n\
    standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for\
    \ data repre-\nsentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted\
    \ and supported by\nvarious programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software\
    \ packages are utilized\nfor constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine\
    \ 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,\nMesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74],\
    \ Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and\nReality [35]. Other speciﬁc software\
    \ packages serving, for example, the construction of\na DT ﬂowsheet model as in\
    \ [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus\nand Aspen HYSYS\
    \ from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from\nChemstations,\
    \ Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC,\nUSA),\
    \ ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc.\n\
    Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting\
    \ for\nan irrigation system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model.\n\
    As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software\n\
    was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed\n\
    with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck\
    \ by\nmultiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.\n\
    In [75], a linear model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent\n\
    planning module close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in\
    \ [29],\nvirtual models are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system\
    \ model in [78], a\nfarm is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model\
    \ via data-driven modelling is\nassessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that\
    \ a software package was developed containing\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n29 of 38\n\
    an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating a prototype\
    \ of\nan intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations to save\
    \ BIM model ﬁles\nin Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine to provide\
    \ 3D modelling software.\nFurther authors in [9] confronted post-harvest models\
    \ by discrete event simulation such as\ndrying, adding to the simulation models\
    \ for blending and ﬂow DT models [82,83] that rely\nheavily on available real-time\
    \ data a ﬂow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT\nmodelling implies\
    \ simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling\nand\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges,\
    \ soil\nagents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents\nTable 4 summarises\

    Structure\nmodelling\nsimulation\nOn the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms\
    \ seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],\nleading to Big Data analytics\
    \ [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n31 of 38\navailable data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored\
    \ in databases such as Mongo\nDB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81],\
    \ besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for\nretrieving height values [79] or generally\
    \ mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to\ncloud big data manipulation\
    \ schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such\nas Alibaba Cloud,\
    \ Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure\nare examples\
    \ of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that\n\
    serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].\nCloud IoT service broker agents come into\
    \ place as a software component or intermedi-\nary that facilitates the interaction\
    \ between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)\nand cloud service\
    \ providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-\nploited,\
    \ adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context\n\
    information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols\
    \ into a\nshared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through\
    \ the processing,\nanalysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally\
    \ is used as an open-\nsource platform to provide a standardized framework and\
    \ a set of reusable components for\nbuilding smart applications and services in\
    \ the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)\ndomains. It aims to simplify\
    \ the development of innovative and interoperable solutions\nby offering a collection\
    \ of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the\ndevelopment\
    \ of smart applications and services.\nA fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive\
    \ and learning capabilities. It handles\nnonlinear and complex relationships between\
    \ variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens\nindustrial plant simulation software\
    \ for plant simulation model production with a weather\nstation. In [67,79], the\
    \ Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other\ndedicated\
    \ software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository\n\
    hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate\
    \ a DT\neditor in [75,76].\nLastly, wireless network communication technologies\
    \ are addressed in the research\nliterature. Initially, the wired networking technology\
    \ Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],\nwhile the wireless networking technologies\
    \ such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],\nLoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile\
    \ or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory\nin [29,82].\
    \ Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].\n5. Discussion\nA ﬁrst attempt\
    \ to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done\nin Section\
    \ 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published\
    \ book,\npropose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture,\
    \ contrary to\nthe rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe\
    \ the topic and record the\nachievements of the scientiﬁc community referring\
    \ to it.\nIt is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference\
    \ papers and a\npublished book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly\
    \ overcome the amount\nof the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The\
    \ limited practical application of digital\ntwin technologies is obvious, even\
    \ stated in the literature by the authors.\nEven though [9,86,87] are review papers,\
    \ the authors either describe the necessity of a\nDT model as in [9] for the agriculture\
    \ supply chain management domain, even addressing\nsensors such as level, ﬂow,\
    \ identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need\nfor future study\
    \ on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring\nschemes,\
    \ LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors\nonboard\
    \ UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing\
    \ farm\noperations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].\nThe\
    \ signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism\n\
    as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]\n\
    where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras,\
    \ IR\nthermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n32 of 38\nluminosity, and relative CO2 concentration,\
    \ and air velocity are addressed as essential\nelements to materialize relevant\
    \ IoT platforms accordingly.\nIn [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water\
    \ management platform is men-\ntioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,\
    \ and in the journal [82], IoT is only\nmentioned as well in the review papers\
    \ [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising\nconcept. The fact that in\
    \ [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,\nin [77] an Arduino\
    \ single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as\nin\
    \ [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms\
    \ or vaguely\npresent a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means\
    \ that the practical imple-\nmentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the\
    \ time being.\nThe necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on\
    \ Python [28,77], ded-\nicated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent,\
    \ OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],\nArduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies\
    \ previously mentioned. These make use\nof Ethernet communication technologies\
    \ [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition\nto [35,74] that make use\
    \ of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that\nfacilitate near\
    \ real-time interaction with the environment.\nThe concept and deﬁnition of DT\
    \ seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,\nit refers to a speciﬁc collection\
    \ of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent\na physical process\
    \ or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior\nforecasting,\
    \ guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical\n\
    entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between\
    \ the\nphysical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize\
    \ and enhance\nperformance and efﬁciency.\nSeveral attempts have been made in\
    \ this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the\nconcept of the DT model\
    \ is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-\nmented case study.\
    \ Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete\nevent\
    \ simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and\n\
    future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop\
    \ growth\nmodels for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals\
    \ giving way to future\npractical implementations. On the other hand, in [28],\
    \ simulation software utilizing a\nsimple plant simulation model is employed to\
    \ create a virtual environment for an irrigation\nsystem’s digital twin. In [73],\
    \ the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the\ndata model is used,\
    \ a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation\nof a\
    \ farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of\
    \ the DT\nmodelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data.\
    \ A more concise\nproposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation\
    \ concept appears in [76],\nwhere a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system\
    \ in Java claimed to be developed, includ-\ning an ontology editor, a digital\
    \ twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],\nsimulation, analysis,\
    \ and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing\nmodelling and\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution\
    \ chal-\nlenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological\
    \ models,\nsoil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment\
    \ of control\nprocesses such as heating and ventilation is automated based on\
    \ short-term temperature\npredictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT\
    \ derivative scheme.\nA ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread\
    \ spreadsheet\napplications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation\
    \ software such as Aspen\nPlus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington,\
    \ MA, USA), ChemCAD\nfrom Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design\
    \ from Honeywell (Charlotte,\nNC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France)\
    \ and PRO/II from AVEVA Group\nplc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach\
    \ to food processing.\nSpreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve\
    \ height values of plants in high-\ntech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],\
    \ a fact that proves that process calculations\nand analyses may be conducted\
    \ using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n\
    33 of 38\ndue to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and professionals\nfrom various ﬁelds.\nEnhanced 3D modelling software derived\
    \ from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-\ngine dictates BIM models in Film\
    \ box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations\nof greenhouses, providing\
    \ a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-\nmentation. Virtual\
    \ representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,\nPhotoshop,\
    \ Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant\nDatasets\
    \ for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual\n\
    Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured\
    \ images\nin 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck\
    \ software. Ad-\nditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are\
    \ used for 3D plant models\noffering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively\
    \ sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent\nplanning module. Using multiple captured images\
    \ taken in 3D space to support the AR\nPerpetual Garden App, they produce botanically\
    \ correct plant models for use in museums\nand for educational purposes. A promising\
    \ perspective, if by any chance associated with\nthe essential elements of the\
    \ holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on\nvarious environmental\
    \ and operational factors via communication technologies leading to\na dynamic\
    \ 3D model of a farm entity.\nBesides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT\
    \ Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in\nparticular [28,73] for real-time data presentation\
    \ and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],\nare proposed, although used on a\
    \ small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of\nDTs with the environment.\
    \ To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even\non a smaller\
    \ scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods\n\
    that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large\
    \ datasets,\nare addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics\
    \ pose a major issue for\nthe advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87],\
    \ not to omit the signiﬁcance of\ndatabases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used\
    \ in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud\ncomputing service providers such as\
    \ Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud platform\
    \ [87].\nVarious factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge,\
    \ seem to be step-\nping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies.\
    \ It is essential\nto meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural\
    \ systems to guarantee the\naccuracy of their corresponding DT models.\n6. Future\
    \ Directions\nOnce addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model,\
    \ in conjunction with\nexpansive sets of data that directly follow the object\
    \ that may evolve and continually modify\nand adapt the model based on the available\
    \ data, it is made clear that future research should\nbe realized to overcome\
    \ the current profound lack of reference models and case studies\naccordingly.\
    \ That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.\nTo broaden\
    \ the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations\n\
    of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research\n\
    in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes\
    \ tar-\ngeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information\
    \ systems should\nbe realized.\nFurther research into the holistic model perception\
    \ of plant DTs to overcome the focus\nmerely on the phenotype of plants could\
    \ vastly support DT research. We can pursue\nenhancing the accuracy of depicting\
    \ real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm\nby combining non-georeferenced\
    \ visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially\nreferenced 3D geo visualizations.\n\
    Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned\n\
    principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling\
    \ of data\nfrom diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information,\
    \ and employing ad-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n34 of 38\nvanced computational methods\
    \ for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the\nunderstanding of\
    \ the subject and aid further studies.\nFurther decommissioning of data in the\
    \ future resulting from search—Tables 1–3\nmight be promising. The diverse and\
    \ abundant potential advantages of DTs in agriculture\ncreate anticipation for\
    \ the future evolution of this technology and its profound impact on\nthe farming\
    \ sector.\nWe aspire for our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the\
    \ application of DTs\nin agriculture even further.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Introduction Over the past few years, wireless networks technologies have made
    significant technological advancement. The revolutionary changes brought about
    by the most recent 5G innovations have benefited a wide range of stakeholders,
    including commercial solution suppliers, university research organizations, standards
    bodies, and mobile-users [1,2]. In contrast, networks comprise a large number
    of Base Stations (BS) to enable high data transmission rates and adequate network
    capacity due to the low penetrability of high-frequency signals used in 5G [3,4].
    The foundation of mobile network service continuity is multi-hop network technology,
    which allows users to seamlessly switch between source to destination that are
    outfitted with various access methods. The complexity of device changeover in
    5G networks grows as a result of the diversity of service networks, increasing
    transmission times and affecting user experiences. As opposed to 5G networks,
    high-density access networks have a high transmission rate among tiny nodes. Existing
    wireless networks have been struggling to handle an increase in traffic due to
    the constant growth of data and devices in cellular networks [5,6]. In response,
    the 6G of cellular communication technologies has arisen to satisfy these high
    expectations. With many different communication networks, including Long Term
    Evolution, the Internet of Things, Mobile multi-hop Networks, wireless personal
    area networks and several versions of Wi-Fi, 6G is incredibly adaptable [7,8].
    The 6G communication network is a network with several additional capabilities
    in addition to being an upgrade of the existing 5G network [9,10]. Research and
    development for 6G aims to provide a variety of advanced qualities, including
    greater bandwidth than existing 5G networks, higher mobile internet connection
    facilitating communication between devices among users as well as extensive technological
    communications [11,12]. Planned 6G networks also seeks to reduce energy consumption,
    latency and enhance security, for better wireless network deployment [13,14].
    Additionally, a rise in connection density will lead to demands for higher energy
    efficiency, which 5G is not intended to provide. As a result, the research community
    has focused on solving the aforementioned key problems [15,16]. Accordingly, we
    assert that current work in the fields of terahertz band communications, intelligent
    surfaces and environments, and network automation. The general architecture of
    6G wireless systems is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (347KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. 6G architecture general diagram. In
    addition to providing standard voice and data connections, 6G wireless technologies
    may also connect a wide range of new gadgets and applications to the rest of society
    [17,18]. Due to the novel architecture, technology, new use cases in 6G wireless
    systems, security and privacy protection will confront new challenges [19,20].
    Providing security factors such as authorization, credibility, and privacy in
    wireless networks due to their ubiquitous structure and finite bandwidth. In terms
    of potential attacks, problems, and issues with confidentiality, there are a number
    of security risks in contemporary cellular networks [21,22]. To this aim, the
    main forces behind a revolutionary enter beyond current wireless systems are a
    combination of societal requirements and technological advancements that help
    to allow those needs. Together, these elements strongly support the requirement
    for a focused study on 6G systems, the newest development in wireless technology.
    To achieve sincere wireless accessibility, we believe that 6G will not only enable
    an ubiquitous, intelligent, dependable, scalable, and secure terrestrial wireless
    network, but will also encompass extraterrestrial communications. This paper outlines
    our vision for wireless networks in the future, highlighting new use cases and
    outlining the key enabling technologies needed to make 6G feasible. We generally
    introduce the primary performance metrics that are expected to direct the design
    of 6G networks. The security needs of 6G wireless networks are highlighted in
    Future generation cellular networks are shown in Table 1 alongside 5G wireless
    networks. Furthermore, 6G wireless networks will be service-oriented, as opposed
    to conventional 5G networks, which gave security and privacy requirements top
    priority when taking into account of services [15]. Table 1. Comparison of 5G
    and 6G security needs. S.No 5G security needs 6G security needs 1 The network''s
    resistance to signaling-based threats, such as overload brought on by malevolent
    or unforeseen causes. Enhance the signaling based threats is mandatory for future
    generation wireless networks 2 Specialized security architecture for use scenarios
    requiring incredibly low latency Improve the security architecture and Low latency

    Security based network implementation is mandatory for 6G networks 4 System resistance
    to intelligent jammer assaults Enhance system resistance to intelligent jammer
    attacks 5 Strengthen 5G Macro cell node security Enhance overall cell node security
    The newly developed applications may have a number of unique needs, such as very
    low user communication delay [23,24]. In addition to enabling more enhanced service
    capabilities, new technologies often introduce security flaws, imposing new security
    specifications for 6G. Various access mechanisms could demand various levels of
    security and a multi network architecture might require repeated authentications
    with strict time limitations [25,26]. A new security architecture is required
    with the introduction of 6G networking technologies. Security must be taken into
    account as a crucial component of the whole structure and need to be incorporated
    in the frame structure to handle these problems. Flexible security measures are
    required to enable various scenarios and new security models in the most secure
    possible approach shows the trust models for both 6G wireless networks and 5G
    networks. The primary motivations for 6G wireless security are listed in Table
    2. Table 2. Comparison of 5G and 6G security mechanism. S.No 5G Lacking 6G Motivation
    1 Security mechanism is not flexible because of new threats New trust models and
    flexible security mechanism is primary motivations 2 Built in security for wireless
    network architecture is adequate New technologies and new design is adequate 3
    Lacking in newest paradigm Novel technology changing the environment In 5G wireless
    networks, verifications are necessary among cellular users, base stations and
    service providers. Additionally, the security requirements for various applications
    can range greatly depending on their application scenario for vertical organizations
    [27,28]. For instance, because of their limited power resources, mobile devices
    require minimal security measures, while high-speed services demand effective
    security measures with minimal delay [29,30]. Consequently, another essential
    requirement for 6G security systems is flexibility. Due to the wide variety and
    enormous quantity of linked devices, 6G authentication is more complicated [31,32].
    1.1. Security and privacy issues in the 6G network High dependability, low latency,
    effective and secure transmission services are issues in the 6G networks. The
    majority of these technologies come with additional security and privacy risks.
    The majority of the elements are susceptible to malicious activity, access control,
    and authentication attacks. But some technologies are especially vulnerable to
    certain problems. For instance, the cellular transmission is especially vulnerable
    to malicious activity and the data transmission process, as are real-time intelligent
    edge and intelligent radio. Intelligent radio is supported by both THz technology
    and cellular communication. Cellular communication technology is connected to
    security and privacy concerns related to exchange of information, encoding, and
    confirmation; malicious behavior and authentication security specifically affect
    THz technology. Intelligent radio, distributed artificial intelligence, and quantum
    communication are areas where block-chain technology and fundamental communication
    intersect. Here, data transmission, encryption, access control, and authentication
    pose the biggest security and privacy risks. These novel environments are vulnerable
    to primary categories of security and privacy problems. 2. Related works [33]
    5G contains security flaws due to its complexity. First of all, the 5G protocol
    falls short of a number of expectations. For instance, the lack of a binding assumption
    on the channel, due to this flaw, an attacker may be able to ask another party
    for their use of a serving network. By recording synchronization failure signals
    over time, researchers discovered that user tracking is still feasible in 5G even
    though it can prevent catcher assaults. In order to support a service-oriented
    network paradigm and address various flaws in 5G, 6G''s security architecture
    and authentication procedures have been greatly improved [34]. Every generation
    of networks has its flaws. Several vulnerabilities still exist despite the fact
    that numerous techniques have been created to reduce exploitation since it is
    difficult to replace key technologies. Fifth generation key authentication protocols
    and security architectures were subject to security assaults and privacy violations,
    although these were rectified at the time. Recent literature has presented a number
    of research studies outlining important technological developments and fresh avenues
    for investigation that could lead to the development of 6G. The authors of [35]
    talked about the related service classes and their performance requirements while
    presenting a vision of some possible 6G applications and trends. They also provided
    a brief overview of their enabling technologies and highlighted several important
    areas for unfinished security issues in research. The authors of [36] provided
    a summary of several potentially ground-breaking security issues of 6G technologies
    and the corresponding network architectural innovations that are intended to rectify
    the shortcomings of the current 5G networks. Similarly, the researchers of [37]
    provided a secure transmission for which allows AI in 6G. They specifically covered
    important AI techniques that could be crucial to the planning and development
    of 6G networks. The authors of [38] investigated the 6G vision from secure transmission
    perspective. They compared the current wireless generations to the proposed 6G
    networks and projected that, in comparison to 5G cellular networks, 6G networks
    would be less expensive. They also illustrated how Machine Learning can be used
    to realize this goal. Within the same framework, the authors in Ref. [39] introduced
    the novel themes that are anticipated to show up and growth the forthcoming 6G
    cellular networks, including experiential data fusion, universal local and cloud
    computing, human-machine interface, and accuracy detecting [40]. The main contributions
    of this paper are summarized as follows. i. We first discuss various security
    and privacy issues as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in 6G cellular networks
    based on security services. ii. The new security concerns Authentication and Acknowledgement
    (AA) Approach on the technologies applied to 6G cellular network systems are then
    presented. iii. Motivated by these security research and development activities,
    we further propose a new 6G wireless security architecture, based on which the
    analysis of secret key authentication and flexible position based identification
    is provided. iv. To demonstrate the benefit of the suggested security architecture,
    we analyze Bit Error rate (BER) vs. SINR, Throughput (bps/THz) vs. SINR results
    for propagation and artificial noise based AA security approach. The remaining
    portion of this paper is structured as follows. Section III discusses authentication
    and acknowledgement approach for secure transmission. Section IV presents proposed
    6G security architecture for enhanced throughput. Section V elaborates secret
    key authentication. Result and Discussions are presented in Section VI. Section
    VII discusses Limitations and Future Recommendations for 6G Cellular Network Security
    and Section VIII presents the conclusion. 3. Proposed authentication and acknowledgement
    (AA) approach In 6G wireless, works new features for security services are introduced
    by novel architecture, new technologies, and new application. This section introduces
    in the following categories of security solutions are cellular subscriber identification,
    data authentication, third party authentication, secrecy, accessibility and authenticity.
    There are different types of authentications, but we concentrated on the most
    significant authentication protocols, namely device and data authentication. To
    combat the current assaults, both authentications are crucial for 6G wireless
    systems. Device authentication is utilized prior communication between two parties
    in typical mobile networks, authentication mechanism both device authentication
    and BS is implemented. Symmetric-key-based authentication is used in 5G mobile
    networks. Moreover, 6G networks, BS, Mobile Stations (MS), Mobile Switching Centers
    (MSC) and service providers all need to be authenticated. In contrast to current
    mobile networks, the proposed Authentication and Acknowledgement (AA) approach
    is suitable for 6G networks. The AA approach can be implemented as follows. AA
    from mobile network, AA from service provider, AA from BS, MS and MSC is adequate.
    6G wireless networks are planned to have remarkably low latency requirements and
    very high data rates i.e., Packet data rate of 6G is 1000 Gbps (20 Gbps for 5G)
    and Experienced date rate is 1 Gbps (0.1 Gbps for 5G), therefore authentication
    in 6G should happen considerably more quickly than in 5G. Message authentication
    is becoming more crucial as 6G wireless networks adopt a variety of new applications.
    However, message authentication faces significant difficulties because of the
    6G standard''s higher demands for lesser delay, effective bandwidth utilization
    and energy conservation. Moreover, AA approach must be more effective than ever
    in 6G networks due to the low latency requirements and higher data rates. Since
    the proposed AA solution is dependent on fundamental MAC layer features of the
    user, it is difficult to completely violate. For applications requiring a high
    level of security, the AA Approach employs various MAC addresses layer characteristics
    to boost authorization validity. Fig. 2 shows the MAC address. Download : Download

    layer characteristics. We examine the flexible authentication and identity management
    based on the suggested 6G wireless security architecture flow diagram shown in
    Fig. 3. In 6G cellular networks support a wide range of devices, including cars,
    smart home appliances and detectors, without the need for a SIM. In 6G cellular
    networks, identity management, authentication, and acknowledgement will differ
    from those in 6G cellular networks. There needs to be new authentication management.
    Authentication and acknowledge needed by switching for a new session and a new
    IP address allocation. The data update based on the new IP address from the new
    access point and new session key. When compared to the 5G cellular network, the
    communication latency can be disregarded. Furthermore, because control plane and
    user plan are integrated, the signaling overhead based on the 6G wireless security
    architecture is significantly lower. Download : Download high-res image (396KB)

    acknowledgement (AA) model. In Fig. 4, the AA model is presented. The AA model
    uses authentication to track and forecast the location of the device, receive
    acknowledgement, and set up the necessary coverage area before the device arrives.
    From AA approach, seamless authentication is made possible. MAC layer features
    are used to create distinct user authentication and to simplify the authentication
    process. The particular to the user MAC layer properties are acknowledged. Following
    a thorough authentication and acknowledgements, the initially approved attributes
    are acquired. At the AA controller, the acknowledgements are gathered by repeatedly
    sampling MAC layer properties from the packets that have been received. The average
    value of the characteristics and Root Mean Square (RMS) of the selected attributes
    are both contained in the received packets and acknowledgements results. Using
    the RMS attributes and received attributes, it is possible to calculate the average
    value. The user equipment is regarded as valid if the average value is above a
    predetermined threshold. Download : Download high-res image (475KB) Download :

    The AA approach is proposed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested
    methodology. An analysis of the network traffic uses a AA approach transmission.
    Different utilization circumstances are evaluated for AA latency. Authentication,
    acknowledgement, and data packet transfer based on the proposed AA protocol. When
    a mobile user sends a request to the BS, the BS immediately interacts with the
    AA server for authentication. Once the AA server sends an acknowledgement following
    the initial authentication in particular coverage area, it is simple to implement
    MAC address verification in coverage area as it only requires signal processing.
    Additionally, comprehensive it is even possible to authenticate without interfering
    with the user communication. The secure layer prerequisite is flexible adjustable
    using a valid time period parameter. The Riverbed simulation results contrasted
    the authentication allowed by AA approach and the traditional authentication approach
    in terms of lower latency performance. AA authentication has lower latency performance
    in 6G networks because of its adaptability and programmability. 6G is an exciting
    replacement to 4G and 5G cellular networks to offer real-time services. However,
    to achieve the safety of transportation, safety and security must be improved.
    A 6G secure network offering bulk data transmission services that is safe and
    considerate of privacy is provided. Fig. 5 shows the structure of the system also
    comprises a secret key generation, channel estimation and message decoding. Terahertz
    (THz) and AA transmission techniques are used in 6G secure communications. To
    increase network bandwidth and attain high information exchange rates, AA is used.
    The AA cloud platform offers enormous storage and unrestricted access to data.
    A key authentication technique, channel estimation with data search, channel decoding,
    encoding and tolerance methods rely on a confidential key transmission of the
    suggested AA mechanisms. The size of data packet in a circular convolutional,
    regard to the number of data packets is optimized using the secret key authentication
    system with privacy preservation for the lowest possible data packet verification
    latency. Download : Download high-res image (523KB) Download : Download full-size

    model consists of the following components: BS, MS, coverage area, cloud server,
    user authentication, and data integrity. Key authentication enables mobile users
    to verify the authenticity of other users. A secret-key based mobile user that
    associates an encrypted bulk of data with the actual identity of the user is used
    to accomplish authentication. The mobile user''s privacy can be protected by using
    a secret authentication method to identify the authorized user. 4. Proposed 6G
    security architecture In this section, we provide the proposed 6G wireless network
    security architecture. Based on the 6G security architecture, user identity and
    secure key authentication are examined. Fig. 6(b) shows proposed 6G wireless network
    security architecture for integration of programmable data plane and control plane
    compared with existing 5G network security architecture Fig. 6(a). We provide
    a 6G wireless security architecture. A Joint solution of programmable data plane
    and programmable control plane, where the data plane and control plane can be
    programmed to reduce complexity is proposed with novel AA methodology of 6G frame
    structure. The 6G core''s data plane''s primary network architecture functionalities
    are recognized in the proposed security architecture. Fixed access application
    also require the mobility management function for the mobile user in 6G security
    architecture. Multiple session management cannot be given for a single user for
    a single access mobile management function. Network splitting, quality of service,
    national and international roaming and mobility are not only provided by the policy
    control function also provided by the Mobility and session management. Download

    a A general 5G wireless network security architecture. b Proposed 6G wireless
    network security architecture. The policy control function does not have any influence
    over the mobility function or session management. In the 5G cellular networks,
    the mobility function and session management are separated. It is impossible to
    maintain a flexible and scalable architecture with the mobility function and session
    management separated. Therefore, integrating session management and mobility functionality
    is adequate for flexible 6G architecture. The several security components that
    provide network functionality, the mobile broadband user interface for safely
    accessing the 6G central system, and protection against numerous threats on the
    wireless connectivity. The latest MAC address layer innovations used to the connected
    channel such as user interface TeraHertz band, Massive cellular devices (Mobile
    station), cellular network, availability, Latency related communication, present
    innovative problems and opportunities in wireless internet access secure transmission.
    Privacy measures include secure device manufacturing and transfer between the
    user interface and the main network. It provides user location and accurate identification,
    data confidentiality, and legitimacy verification. The 6G core and radio access
    network employ new technologies like artificial intelligence, neural networks,
    cloud servers, and network integrity exist in the security architecture. The secure
    transmission is present between the radio access network and the 6G core, integration
    of the control and the user plane, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The integration of the
    control plane and user plane, however, reduced the complexity of the network''s
    component. The data plane, which is based on standard network operations also
    reduces network traffic. The primary security services at this level include position-based
    authentication, error control signaling systems, and cooperative solutions. The
    properties of network access technologies allow for the simplification and enhancement
    of network domain security performance. Position based authentication is the primary
    concern. Depending on the situation, mobile user, device and authorization channel
    require authentication. There is a need for location-based authentication between
    cellular users and network providers. Additionally, various network operators
    must authenticate every cellular user inside the coverage region before allowing
    them to share a different user ID. New identity techniques are required in comparison
    to position based identity in cellular networks to increase privacy and security.
    Application layer security features make sure that cellular user interfaces and
    network operators can exchange secret keys with applications layer and device
    interfaces. a) Performance Metrics Analysis Privacy can be built on a foundation
    of data Accessibility, confidentiality, and integrity guaranteed by the security
    design is shown in Table 3. The ability to safeguard private information belonging
    to a particular entity at every stage of the data life cycle—including data collection,
    processing, and usage is known as privacy preservation. Privacy is governed by
    three principles that differ from security. There are numerous reasons why protecting
    privacy in 6G is more crucial. First of all, it''s difficult to protect personal
    data in the age of supercomputers and intelligent agents. Expect an exponential
    increase in demand for AI-enabled smart applications with a massive network like
    6G connecting people and things. Second, more private user data is anticipated
    to be accessible in 6G through major applications like implant cyborgs, wearable
    technology, and smart apparel. Positively, these applications can make people''s
    lives better by lowering the chance of deadly accidents, improving quality of
    sleep, or aiding in the rehabilitation of those who are disabled. Performance
    metrics analysis for various security attacks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

    localization through communication in dense networks. There are serious worries
    that the concept of THz Access Points tracking a user''s movements with centimeter-level
    accuracy to enhance link connectivity could be abused for spying purposes. 5.
    Secret key authentication The subscriber identity module (SIM) is used in 6G mobile
    networks for secret key identification. However, many equipment, including smartphones
    and telecom parts are supported by 6G wireless networks without the need for a
    SIM card. Position-based identification is dependent on the AA strategy. Additionally,
    many 6G wireless network applications require privacy services. In 6G wireless
    networks, the position-based identification is harmonized across all use cases.
    As depicted in Fig. 7, secret key exchange can be used depending on the user''s
    attributes. As a result, position based identity in 6G wireless networks will
    differ from 5G cellular networks. There must be new identity management is adequate
    for 6G wireless networks. In order to maintain service performance in the era
    of widely connected devices and applications, efficiently managing massive identities
    is crucial. Identity management in 5G cellular networks is device-based. In a
    specific novel use case, like a smart home, a single user may require multiple
    devices in order to access the services and network. The user will be able to
    decide which devices are permitted access to the network and services with greater
    efficiency to user-based identity management. Multiple identities for a single
    user device are possible. Service identity can be added with device identity as
    well as device and service identity management, in addition to taking into account
    the device identity. Device identities are distinct, and service providers may
    assign service identities during specific sessions. The termination process will
    be made simpler with position based identification. Furthermore, federated identity
    management can be used by trusted service providers to streamline position-based
    identification and enhance user satisfaction. Not every use case in 6G cellular
    networks uses the same identity management system. Various position-based identity
    management techniques can be used, depending on the use case''s requirements.

    Fig. 7. Position based Identification approach in 6G wireless networks. In 5G
    cellular networks, when a user device switches its access point using a different
    access technology, the same authentication is required, which raises latency and
    communication overhead and may result in a connection outage. However, by moving
    to a new coverage area for a new session and IP address allocation, the proposed
    security architecture eliminates the need for authentication. The suggested 6G
    wireless security architecture''s secret key authentication is described. Fig.
    8 shows that the authentication process for mobile user introductory network access
    based on several security concepts. The authentication vector is created and transmitted
    based on the proposed security architecture. To reduce latency and complexity
    of network, secret key generated in our proposed security architecture. Programmable
    data plane and control plane can be broadly deployed to handle the authentication
    of a sizable number of cellular users to the flexibility of network operations.
    Integrating programmable plane of operation and user conveyance allows for distributed
    deployment. As a result, it is possible to significantly reduce the complexity
    of a novel central infrastructure due to programmable governance and application
    layer integration. Download : Download high-res image (520KB) Download : Download

    Fig. 9. Bit error rate vs SINR (dB). In these simulations, the user interface
    contains 2 secret keys while the attacker, third parties, and each have their
    own secret key. Bit Error Rate (BER) vs Signal-to-Interference Noise Ratio (SINR)
    results for propagation and artificial noise-based AA security approaches are
    shown in Fig. 9. The figure shows that the performance of the BER at the user
    interface is 12 % improved by the transmission of the secret key compared to CoMP
    (Common receiver using Coordinated Multipoint), GKM (Group Key management) and
    OSPR (Operational System Performance Review) technique, however the performance
    of the attacker is unaffected and is comparable to the scenario at hand. Therefore,
    the BER performance gap between the user interface and the attacker shows that
    propagation can indeed provide a quantifiable level of privacy. The impact of
    synthetic noise and AWGN noise-based approaches is also displayed. The curve plotted
    throughput against SINR is shown in Fig. 10. Enhanced throughput obtained compared
    to GKM, OSPR, CoMP. To further widen the BER performance gap between the user
    interface and the attacker. The graphic makes it evident that AWGN and manufactured
    noise, which together account for 20 % of the total transmit power used here,
    significantly worsen the attacker''s BER performance. Depending on the appropriate
    security, the power can be varied. The observation that propagation based on user
    interface channel improves user performance is similar to the observations made
    previously. Additionally, it demonstrates the efficacy of this class of solutions
    by confirming that the introduction of noise greatly widens the throughput gap
    between the user interface and the attacker. Download : Download high-res image

    The example of a flexible designed noise-based authentication technique is provided.
    Based on threat classification and level, this can provide secure connectivity
    for various applications and services by flexible capacity allocation. According
    to security criteria, the curves for BER vs SINR and throughput versus SINR are
    shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, respectively, for various percentages of the total
    transmitted power allotted to designed noise. It has been found that as noise
    power is increased from 0 to 600 for BER against SINR. Download : Download high-res

    varies from 0 to 1000 and throughput varies from 100 to 600 bps/Hz. 50 %, the
    attacker''s BER and throughput performance suffers while the actual receiver''s
    performance suffers little to no impact. Different services have various QoS needs
    and if it is confirmed that the attacker is operating below those QoS requirements.
    Therefore, it is possible to assure that the BER at the attacker is over 10−4,
    10−3.5, 10−3 and 10−2.5 respectively by introducing 10 %, 30 % and 50 % noise.
    This can be utilized to provide security that is appropriate for changing QoS
    needs. 7. Limitations and future recommendations for 6G cellular network security
    This section outlines the difficulties and potential paths for 6G security research
    and development. A portion of the security solutions employed in 5G will be developed
    into 6G, per the earlier sections. Nevertheless, security services in 6G face
    numerous obstacles in order to handle 6G advanced features, given the wide range
    of use cases and integrated technologies applied to 6G. Here are some viewpoints
    on the difficulties and related future paths that are being discussed. i. Dependability
    In addition to providing new functions for individuals and society, 6G wireless
    networks'' advanced services are also being applied to upward industries, such
    as digital health, intelligent homes, the energy efficiency, and transportation
    networks. User terminals, dwellings, and supplying networks are all regarded as
    reliable in 5G cellular networks. In 6G cellular networks, the dependability varies
    depending on the use case and may involve novel entities [12]. It might be necessary
    to establish authentication between different users with varying degrees of dependability.
    Research on dependability for various use cases has been conducted. The authors
    of [44] put forth a system model to enable safe data transfer via wireless networks
    for automobile communications. One aspect of the suggested system model is motorized
    vehicles. In the 5G cellular networks, dependability between them is more complicated.
    To enhance the efficiency of security services like authentication for The World
    Wide Web users, novel dependability models are required due to the vast quantity
    of devices connected to 6G cellular networks. But there is a lack of consistency
    between the center for integration and the medical equipment in Ref. [40]. However
    new dependability models are required for new 6G applications. ii. Eavesdropping
    Attacks The most popular attack model, according to recent cellular network research,
    involves a single eavesdropper equipped with multiple device. However, in 6G cellular
    networks, there may be a large number of eavesdroppers. Furthermore, sophisticated
    technology can be used to grasp eavesdroppers [38]. Different types of attacks
    may exist in real-world scenarios. The cooperation of devices or eavesdroppers
    is not taken into account in cellular networks by focusing only on one type of
    attack, which can complicate application layer security. While boosting the sender''s
    transmission power can prevent overloading attempts, it may also make eavesdropping
    attempts more likely. Furthermore, weak spots are exposed as a result of the new
    service delivery model being implemented to the cellular network [9]. Software
    security becomes independent of the unique security features of the hardware platform
    when hardware and software are decoupled [12]. As a result, there is a constant
    need for strong isolation in virtualization. In Ref. [11], network splitting is
    introduced to offer isolated security. Using an attack mechanism an efficient
    vulnerability assessment mechanism for device-based mobile networks is presented
    in Ref. [36]. On the other hand, not much work has been done on the new security
    attack models. iii. Confidentiality Numerous new 6G applications require data,
    which means that massive amounts of sensitive data are being transferred over
    6G cellular networks. Because 6G cellular networks use open network platforms,
    there are significant factors in confidentiality [15]. Ensuring confidentiality
    is a crucial prerequisite for deploying various applications. The degree of confidentiality
    in various use cases may differ depending on the security requirements, including
    identity and location confidentiality. For instance, in [45], the suggested protocol
    offers mutual authentication between patients and physicians as well as security
    of data access to protect confidentiality. Currently, methods of cryptography
    are primarily used for enhancing confidentiality. Due to the large volume of data,
    both the encryption and decryption may not meet other 5G service requirements
    like efficiency and latency. Effective confidentiality is difficult, particularly
    in the face of potent data analysis techniques like machine learning. But data
    analysis can also be employed as a tool to support wise security of information
    implementation. To lower the cost of encryption while maintaining confidentiality,
    data analysis can be used, for instance, to identify a number of extremely sensitive
    dimensions prior to data transmission. Instead of relying solely on device-based
    identity management, new identity management should be taken into consideration
    for confidentiality in 6G cellular networks. 8. Conclusion Cellular networks have
    been successful because of their emphasis on secure transmission. When everyone''s
    access to the internet is ensured in 6G, the networks will grow to enormous sizes.
    We have presented a thorough analysis of current advancements in 6G wireless security
    in this paper. We proposed a 6G wireless security architecture based on existing
    research. From the suggested security framework, an analysis of position based
    identification and adaptable authentication based on different security architectures
    has been provided. Demonstrated the benefits of the proposed architecture, Analyzed
    the performance of BER at the User Interface is 94 % improved than the CoMP, GKM
    and OSPR. Furthermore, Enhanced Throughput 96 % achieved for AA Approach due to
    integration of data plane and control plane in the proposed architecture. The
    efficacy of this class of solution is verified by using Riverbed Modeler 17.5
    simulation tool. CRediT authorship contribution statement Samuthira Pandi V: Formal

  description: Breast cancer is a common disease that can result in death among women.
    Cancer research is important because early detection of cancer facilitates clinical
    practice for patients. The aim of the study is to ensure that breast cancer can
    be diagnosed in a short time and easily. For this purpose, a dataset containing
    116 samples, 9 features and 2 target variables (Breast Cancer Coimbra) from the
    UCI library was used during the training and testing phases. A hybrid structure
    was created with genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to
    classify the datasets. With the established hybrid model, the feedforward backpropagation
    artificial neural network model and the hyperparameters in this model structure
    have been optimized with the genetic algorithm. The performance of the structure
    constructed with the most successful gene parameters obtained was compared with
    weighted K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, and linear support vector machine
    methods. In all machine learning methods used, fivefold cross-validation was applied
    and the dataset was divided into two groups as 50% training and 50% testing in
    order to test the models with different data. The hybrid model proposed in the
    study performed better than other machine learning methods with 100% correct classification
    rate. Although there are few data in this study, the accuracy is higher than other
    literature. In addition, an iOS–android-based application has been developed for
    the diagnosis and prediction of the disease with the findings obtained. Thanks
    to the developed application, the most important factor in the fight against the
    disease, time and cost spent for the diagnosis of this disease will be saved.
    Considering the interest in artificial intelligence techniques in cancer research,
    this study presents a new diagnostic method and a usable application in terms
    of patient decision support systems.

    groups as 50% training and 50% testing in order to test the models with different
    data. The hybrid model proposed in the study performed better than other machine
    learning methods with 100% correct classification rate. Although there are few
    data in this study, the accuracy is higher than other literature. In addition,
    an iOS–android-based application has been developed for the diagnosis and prediction
    of the disease with the findings obtained. Thanks to the developed application,
    the most important factor in the fight against the disease, time and cost spent
    for the diagnosis of this disease will be saved. Considering the interest in artificial
    intelligence techniques in cancer research, this study presents a new diagnostic
    method and a usable application in terms of patient decision support systems.

    15 May 2014 GA-ANN Framework for Breast Cancer Classification Using NSGA-II Chapter
    © 2022 1 Introduction One essential factor that can cause death in women is breast
    cancer [1]. The mortality rate from breast cancer is 48% in nations with low or
    moderate levels of the Human Development Index. As compared to nations with high
    or very high human development metrics, this rate is four times greater. The early
    identification of breast cancer is rendered possible by good screening programs,
    which benefits the treatment of breast cancer. [2] The main method for diagnosing
    breast cancer is mammography. But nevertheless, women with thick breast tissue’s
    scanning sensitivity decline for causes such as tissue overlap [3]. Early diagnosis
    and treatment of breast cancer have been shown to be beneficial in eradicating
    the disease [4]. Moreover, early identification and treatment are crucial because
    of the substantial economic and societal costs associated with breast cancer.
    Many artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to anticipate and diagnose
    patients with breast cancer as a result of technological advancements. For the
    diagnosis and classification of breast cancer, Lin et al. [5] used artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). In the study, SVM performed
    a more accurate classification, and in a subsequent step, transfer learning was
    used to train the AlexNet, ResNet101, and InceptionV3 networks. Successful outcomes
    for the diagnosis of breast cancer were determined by the research. Rasool et
    al. [6] used the logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), community
    classifier (EC), and SVM techniques to try and identify benign and malignant tumors.
    These models’ diagnostic ability was enhanced using data exploratory techniques.
    SVM polynomial kernel had a success rate of 99.3% in the research using Wisconsin
    Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) and Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCD). For
    the diagnosis of breast cancer, Jayandhi et al. [7] created an effective deep
    learning architecture (DLA) with SVM. In this experiment, which combines concepts
    from DLA and SVM, tiny size 3x3 convolution filters and 16-layer state-of-the-art
    visual geometric group (VGG) architecture are employed, which decreases system
    complexity. The findings of the investigation demonstrated that the VGG-SVM model
    successfully classified images from the Mammographic Imaging Analysis Association
    database with 98.67% accuracy, 99.32% sensitivity, and 98.34% specificity. So
    for diagnosis of breast cancer, Gutierrez et al. [8] applied deep learning. In
    the study, which also addresses the false positive concern in breast cancer diagnosis,
    Resnet34, Tsallis entropy-based image segmentation, and Gaussian filter-based
    preprocessing approaches were selected for feature extraction. The chimpanzee
    optimization algorithm was used in the research to successfully tune the ResNet
    34 model’s hyperparameters (COA). In their investigation on the detection of breast
    cancer, Rani et al. [9] employed decision tree and average sensor algorithms.
    Several ML techniques were experimentally tested in this work, which used algorithms
    to develop a hybrid structure. The proposed hybrid technique achieved an accuracy
    of 98.1% as a result of the analyses and assessments. For the early identification
    of breast cancer, Tarawneh et al. [10] suggested a decision tree-based methodology.
    Ten breast cancer samples from the Kaggle archive were used in the study, and
    286 breast cancer samples from the same pool were used in the follow-up. In the
    study, the first trial’s success rate was 100%, while the second trial’s success
    rate was 97.9%. For the diagnosis of breast cancer, Aslan et al. [11] employed
    ANN, conventional extreme SVM, KNN, and extreme learning machine (ELM) techniques.
    In the study, various ML techniques were applied to the BCCD dataset. The experimental
    experiments led to an accuracy of 83.80% with the ELM approach. In order to diagnose
    breast cancer, Fijri et al. [12] used fuzzy core c-means (FKCM), clustering, and
    sparse learning fuzzy c-means algorithms. The study that employed various ML techniques
    used the BCDD dataset. They achieved 89.20% accuracy with the FKCM approach in
    the study in which the experimental studies were presented in a comparative manner.
    An expert system for use in the diagnosis of breast cancer was described by Araújo
    et al. [13]. Based on the ideas of neural networks and fuzzy systems, they proposed
    a hybrid model in the study. In this study, the fuzzy neural network model was
    successful in diagnosing breast cancer 81.04% of the time using the BCDD dataset.
    An efficient predictive model for use in the detection of breast cancer was developed
    by Yavuz and Eyupoglu [14] using a generalized regression neural network model
    with median filtering and a stepwise principal component analysis technique. Using
    the BCDD dataset, the study had a success rate of 97.73%. Breast cancer classification
    was suggested by Alshutbi et al. in 2022 [15]. In the suggested study, the Jaya
    algorithm was used to optimize the penalty factor parameter and kernel parameter
    in the SVM method. Using the BCDD dataset, the Jaya-SVM hybrid structure has a
    success rate of 98.21%. Most studies in the literature end up choosing their models
    for use in artificial intelligence techniques through a process of trial and error.
    The success of the applied model is directly impacted by changes in the number
    of input parameters utilized for the chosen method or the hyperparameters determined
    in the installed architectures. As a consequence, the models’ hyperparameters
    should be optimized in accordance with the input parameters, and the hyperparameters
    of the models utilized in accordance with the various input parameters should
    be optimized independently. Such nested optimization problems can only be solved
    by developing hybrid structures utilizing ML models and optimization algorithms
    [16, 17]. The optimum outcome, or a solution that comes near to the best solution,
    for the issue is provided by hybrid structures created employing optimization
    methods [18]. In this research, a hybrid structure was developed for breast cancer
    diagnosis and prediction, and a model was developed by optimizing all hyperparameters
    in a feedforward backpropagation ANN structure. On BCDD, the suggested model was
    used. The dataset that was not included in the training was tested using several
    ML techniques and the suggested hybrid model, and the results were published.
    Also, the model’s outcomes using the hybrid structure are shown and examined in
    relation to previous research. Also, an application built for the iOS and Android
    platforms has been created to aid in the diagnosis and forecasting of the condition
    utilizing the parameters gleaned from experiments conducted. 2 Materials and methods
    2.1 Genetic algorithm Artificial intelligence optimization algorithms are constantly
    striving to enhance the solutions, albeit they cannot guarantee that the solution
    they find is the best solution but rather that it is very close to the optimum
    solution [18]. GA is one of the optimization methods that is often used in the
    literature and aims to discover the best answers to problems by replicating natural
    processes. Figure 1 illustrates the genetic algorithm’s flowchart. Fig. 1 GA flowchart
    Full size image In Fig. 1, GA produces a population of random solutions. Each
    solution in the population is a binary sequence. A chromosome is the term of this
    structure. Each chromosome’s fitness is assessed using the fitness function [19].
    The chromosomes in the population are subjected to many genetic processes, including
    crossover, mutation, and selection. 2.2 Artificial neural network An information
    ML technique called ANN uses the function of nerve cells as an illustration [17].
    Artificial neural network modeling for steam ejector design requires rigorous
    data processing to produce predictions and models that faithfully mirror real
    systems. More than one nerve cell connecting to one another creates network architectures.
    Figure 2 depicts the structure of a single neuron cell. Fig. 2 Neuron cell structure
    Full size image In Fig. 2, the inputs to the neuron cell are multiplied by their
    weights before being sent to the addition function. The bias is applied to the
    result of the addition function. The bias allows the activation function to be
    shifted because of the various value it accepts. Consequently, the neuron’s net
    input is determined. By processing this net input through the activation function,
    the neuron cell’s output is obtained. Several algorithms are utilized in the literature
    to train the ANN network structure [20]. Backpropagation algorithms in feedforward
    networks have been used successfully in supervised learning algorithms [21]. The
    illustration in Fig. 3 shows a basic feedforward backpropagation ANN structure.
    Fig. 3 A feedforward backpropagation ANN structure Full size image The outputs
    of each neuron cell are utilized as the input data for the subsequent neuron cell
    in the feedforward and backpropagation network structure shown in Fig. 3. The
    raw input data sent to the network are located in the input layer. The input data
    are multiplied by the weights chosen by the network when it is sent to the hidden
    layer. By adding the bias values chosen by the network, these values which are
    summed up in the sum function in each neuron cell are transferred to the activation
    function. With the activation function, the neuron’s input information is transformed
    into output information. The same techniques are used to send the output data
    collected from each neuron cell across the network to the output layer. By comparing
    the output information produced at the output layer with the desired output information,
    the error is computed. This ’error’ is mirrored in the network in the back propagation
    network structure by the learning function, allowing the weights to be updated
    once more. The number of inputs employed by each of the three levels of the network
    structure shown in Fig. 3, the number of hidden layers, the choice of activation
    function, and the learning function all have an impact on how well the network
    performs. 2.3 Other machine learning methods used in the study Table 1 lists additional
    machine learning techniques that were applied in this research. Table 1 Other
    machine learning methods used in the study Full size table Machine learning techniques
    presented in Table 1 are frequently used in the literature [28,29,30,31]. 3 Experimental
    studies and results 3.1 Dataset Breast cancer was identified in this research
    using the Breast Cancer Coimbra (BCDD) dataset, which is available at UCI. The
    BCDD dataset is frequently utilized in the literature [6, 32, 33]. This dataset
    contains nine defining features, which are listed in Table 2. Table 2 Descriptive
    attributes found the dataset Full size table Between 2009 and 2013, the Physiology
    Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine at Coimbra University in Portugal used the
    data acquired by taking different measures from peripheral venous blood bottles
    taken in the hospital for all subjects. A pathologist trained in the Department
    of Pathology examined tissues collected from cancer patients. [34]. The collection
    contains 116 pretreatment samples from 64 breast cancer patients and 52 healthy
    women [35]. Healthy women were classed as 1, and unwell women as 2, in the dataset.
    In order to reduce the number of samples in the dataset and to test the models
    more thoroughly using various constructs, the dataset was split into two groups:
    50% training data and 50% test data. In order to evaluate the performance of the
    models to be used in experimental research on the data that are not seen, as objectively
    and accurately as feasible, fivefold cross-validation was employed throughout
    the training stages. 3.2 Performance evaluations matrices In this research, four
    cross-validation matrices for each classifier were compared. They are precision,
    recall, F1 score, and accuracy. A confusion matrix is used to calculate these
    values. Figure 4 illustrates a confusion matrix structure. Fig. 4 Confusion matrix
    structure Full size image The true positive (TP) in the confusion matrix shown
    in Fig. 4 stands for people who are believed to be healthy. False negative (FN)
    is the percentage of healthy people who are thought to be ill. False positive
    (FP) is the number of people who are thought to be healthy but are actually sick.
    The number of sick people projected to be sick is represented by true negative
    (TN). Equations 1–4 display the computation of the precision, recall, F1 score,
    and accuracy values in accordance with the matrix displayed in Fig. 4 [6]. $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\text {Precision}\\,(P)= & {} \\frac{\\text {TP}}{\\text {TP}+\\text {FP}} \\end{aligned}$$

    {FP}} \\end{aligned}$$ (4) 3.3 Proposed model In this part of the research, a
    hybrid model combining GA and feedforward backpropagation ANN is suggested to
    be utilized for the detection and prediction of breast cancer. Many hyperparameters
    in the ANN network layout have a direct impact on the network performance. To
    achieve successful outcomes, it is crucial to optimize these hyperparameters.
    The success of the network is also strongly impacted by variations in the input
    parameters that must be provided as input. For various inputs, the same network
    architecture yields various results. The input data should also be optimized while
    choosing the network topology with the best hyperparameters for the challenge
    at hand. Optimization methods can be used to find the ANN network structure with
    the best or nearly optimal performance [16] Fig. 5 depicts the flowchart of the
    suggested hybrid structure for diagnosing and predicting breast cancer. Fig. 5
    Hybrid model flowchart Full size image The initial parameters of the model described
    in Fig. 5 were established in the first stage of the flow diagram, as stated in
    Table 3. The MATLAB platform was used to create the model due to its advantages
    for coding and structural flexibility. Table 3 GA parameters for hybrid model
    Full size table The parameters presented in Table 3 are the starting points of
    the GA. These parameters were obtained as a result of experimental studies. Establishing
    the model’s starting population is the next phase in the hybrid model that has
    been presented. Each gene in the initial population is created together with an
    input selection for that gene. Gene sequencing in the hybrid model is shown in
    Fig. 5; NI stands for input values, NHL for hidden layer count, NN for neurons
    per layer count, activation functions for AV hidden layers, and TV for learning
    algorithm. Each gene’s (G) NI value is randomly chosen from the values listed
    in Table 2 during the population generation step. The function shown in Eq. 5
    was used to confine the NHL value for each gene, which was determined randomly.
    $$\\begin{aligned} G_{a}\\text {NHL}_{b}(z)={\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}1 &{}
    z < 1\\\\ z &{} 1\\le z \\le 12\\\\ 12 &{} z>12\\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$
    (5) The \\(G_a\\text {NHL}_b(z)\\) given in Eq. 5 represents the NHL value of
    gene a in b iteration. The NN value for each gene was determined randomly and
    constrained by the function presented in Eq. 6. $$\\begin{aligned} G_{a}\\text
    {NN}_{b}(z)={\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}1 &{} z < 1\\\\ z &{} 1\\le z \\le 12\\\\
    12 &{} z>12\\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$ (6) The \\(G_a\\text {NN}_b(z)\\)
    given in Eq. 6 represents the NN value of gene a in the b iteration. The AV value
    for each gene was determined randomly and constrained by the function presented
    in Eq. 7. $$\\begin{aligned} G_{a}\\text {AV}_{b}(z)={\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}1
    &{} z < 1\\\\ z &{} 1\\le z \\le 6\\\\ 6 &{} z>6\\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) The \\(G_a\\text {AV}_b(z)\\) given in Eq. 7 represents the AV value of gene
    a in the b iteration. Activation functions corresponding to the determined \\(G_aAV_b(z)\\)
    value are shown in Table 4. Table 4 AV parameters and values Full size table The
    TV value for each gene was determined randomly and constrained by the function
    presented in Eq. 8. $$\\begin{aligned} G_{a}\\text {TV}_{b}(z)={\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}1
    &{} z < 1\\\\ z &{} 1\\le z \\le 15\\\\ 15 &{} z>15\\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$
    (8) The \\(G_a\\text {TV}_b(z)\\) given in Eq. 8 represents the TV value of gene
    a in the b iteration. The learning functions corresponding to the determined \\(G_a\\text
    {TV}_b(z)\\) value are shown in Table 5. Table 5 TV parameters and values Full
    size table The network structure for each gene is generated for the hybrid model’s
    subsequent phase based on the values found in its chromosomes. Each G is created
    in accordance with the input selection chosen for it, and the training-derived
    verification data are used to assess each G’s performance. The fitness functions
    provided in Eqs. 9–11 are used to assess the effectiveness of the ANN structure
    produced with each gene. $$\\begin{aligned} \\text {Tf}(G_{k})= & {} \\text {Learning-Accuracy}\\,(\\text
    {ANN}_k) \\end{aligned}$$ (9) $$\\begin{aligned} \\text {Vf}(G_{k})= & {} \\text
    {Test-Accuracy}\\,(\\text {ANN}_k) \\end{aligned}$$ (10) $$\\begin{aligned} \\text
    {Ff}(G_k)= & {} \\text {Max}(\\text {Tf}(G_k)+\\text {Vf}(G_k)) \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) In Eq. 9 the \\(\\text {Tf}(G_{k})\\) value represents the Learning-Accuracy
    fitness value of the k gene and the \\(\\text {ANN}_k\\) value refers the ANN
    generated for the k gene. In Eq. 10, the \\(\\text {Vf}(G_k)\\) value shows the
    Test-Accuracy fitness value of the k gene. In Eq. 11, \\(\\text {Ff}(G_k)\\) value
    represents the fitness value of gene k. The hybrid model’s subsequent stage involved
    selecting among the population’s genes. The roulette wheel approach has been used
    in the selection process because it generates successful outcomes based on the
    probabilities of the people who are suited for the solution [36]. Following evaluation
    of each G’s performance in the hybrid model, their cumulative probabilities were
    computed, and genes were chosen based on the roulette value generated at random.
    Crossover between genes in the population comes next after calculating the fitness
    functions in the hybrid model. The timing of the gene crossover was randomly determined.
    On the chosen random point, a single-point crossover operation was carried out.
    The hybrid model’s crossover operation was followed by the application of the
    mutation process to the population’s genes. Each chromosome in each G was assigned
    a random number between 0 and 1, and the mutation rate shown in Table 3 was used
    to determine whether the chromosome would change. The chromosomes that were going
    to be altered received random additions (integer values between \\(-5\\) and \\(+5\\)).
    The constraint functions shown in Eqs. 5–8 are applied at this stage. In order
    to assist the population move to more promising fields that might contain optimality,
    elitism was utilized in each iteration [37]. The gene with the highest fitness
    value was chosen, as can be seen in Table 3, after the fitness values of each
    gene in the hybrid model that underwent 100 iterations were assessed using the
    fitness functions provided in Eqs. 9–11. Table 6 shows the ANN network parameters
    for the gene that produced the highest fitness value. Table 6 The most successful
    gene parameters and values Full size table The network structure established with
    the network parameters of the most successful gene presented in Table 6 is shown
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 ANN structure created with the most successful gene Full size
    image The weights of the data entering the neuron cells and the bias values within
    the neuron cells are additional factors influencing the network performance in
    the network topology shown in Fig. 6. Table 7 displays these values that were
    applied to the network using the hybrid model. Table 7 Weights and bias values
    found in the network for the most successful gene Full size table The parameters
    of the most successful gene derived using the hybrid model and employed in the
    network are represented by the weights and bias values in Table 7. The learning
    function and back propagation in the most successful gene were used to determine
    these values. To repeat the experiment, control the accuracy value achieved, and
    transfer it to the application, it is crucial to use the network parameters produced
    with the hybrid model and shown in Tables 6 and 7, which are in the most successful
    gene. 4 The experimental results and discussıon In experimental trials for breast
    cancer detection and prediction, weighted KNN, decision tree, linear SVM, and
    the presented hybrid model were each used individually. Figure 4 displays the
    confusion matrix for each model. Fig. 7 Confusion matrices of the models used
    Full size image According to the confusion matrices presented in Fig. 7, the most
    successful classifier is the presented hybrid model, which correctly evaluated
    all test data and correctly predicted all diagnoses. The ROC curves for each classifier
    model are shown in Fig. 8. ROC curves are one of the most crucial factors in assessing
    the effectiveness of models in ML [38]. The FP ratio and TP ratio are represented
    by the ROC curve’s horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The AUC is the
    region below this curve [39]. The AUC area of that model is where it performs
    best, and the optimal value for AUC is 1. As compared to other ML techniques,
    the hybrid model given in Fig. 8 performed the best. Fig. 8 ROC curves of machine
    learning methods Full size image Precision–recall–F-measure: According to Eqs.
    1–4, the accuracy values of the ML approaches employed to classify breast cancer
    are shown in Table 8. Table 8 Experimental results for breast cancer classification

    outperformed other classifiers in terms of success rates. Table 9 displays the
    results of comparing the suggested model with research done using the same dataset
    in the literature. Table 9 Literature comparison with the proposed model Full
    size table As can be seen in Table 9, the research using the proposed model yielded
    better outcomes than other studies using the same dataset in the literature. 5
    Application In this part of the research, an iOS–Android-based application was
    created for the detection and prediction of breast cancer utilizing the experimental
    data. The values of the parameters listed in Table 6 were used to generate the
    ANN structure in the built application. The network topology has a single hidden
    layer, and the hidden layer uses the logsig activation function. Equation 12 illustrates
    the mathematical expression of the Logsig activation function. $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\text {logsig}\\,(a)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{a}} \\end{aligned}$$ (12) In the developed
    application, purelin activation function is used in the output layer. The mathematical
    expression of the Purelin activation function is shown in Eq. 13. $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\text {purelin}\\,(a)=a \\end{aligned}$$ (13) With the network parameters shown
    in Tables 6 and 7, the ANN structure was programmed in Android Studio. The created
    application first arranges the input data as shown in Table 6. The neurons in
    the hidden layer receive the sorted input data. Considering the weight and bias
    values in Table 7, the sending operation is conducted. Each neuron’s activation
    function, shown in Eq. 12, is used for filtering the results that result from
    this procedure. According to the weight and bias values shown in Table 7, the
    values from the activation functions are re-added to the neuron cell in the output
    layer. This gathered value is sent through the purelin function shown in Eq. 13
    to produce output information. In terms of breast cancer, a person is healthy
    if the output value is 0; otherwise, a person is sick if it is 1. Figure 9 illustrates
    screenshots of the application that was created. Fig. 9 Application screenshots

    in the ANN structure. The network structure built by the software designed with
    modular coding is traversed by the input data that has been received. The user
    is notified as shown in Fig. 9b with the output. On all smart devices, this designed
    application is simple to install and use. 6 Conclusion and discuss Breast cancer
    is one of the most significant illnesses affecting women worldwide. Early detection
    of breast cancer and the beginning of therapy have a significant impact on the
    eventual eradication of the condition. In this research, a hybrid model for the
    diagnosis of breast cancer based on GA-ANN is proposed. The Breast Cancer Coimbra
    Dataset, which is frequently used in the literature, was used as the dataset in
    the suggested model. The number and order of the input data, the number of hidden
    layers between the input and output layers, the number of neurons in these layers,
    the activation functions applied to the neuron cells in the layers, and the learning
    algorithm of the network are all optimized as a result of the hybrid model that
    was developed. The investigations conducted thus far on this dataset have produced
    better results, according to experimental findings. Along with the hybrid model
    offered: A model with greater accuracy than the research in the literature has
    been provided using the characteristics in the BCBD data set, which is frequently
    employed in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The number of hidden
    layers, the number of neuron cells to use in each layer, the activation functions
    to use in each layer, and the propagation algorithm to use in the network structure
    that should be established with ANN for the diagnosis and diagnosis of breast
    cancer were all optimized. The network’s optimal input data transmission sequence
    has been determined. The model generated the best network models for these specified
    characteristics, increasing the success rate while also having selected features.
    The model that is being given makes it possible to access these parameters by
    optimizing every application-specific parameter. In accordance with these findings,
    an iOS–Android application was created using the parameters selected by the hybrid
    model described. To effectively manage this condition, early detection and planning
    are essential. Additionally, with regard to the iOS–Android app developed utilizing
    the data from the hybrid model: Doctors would be able to undertake early diagnosis
    and diagnosis even in rural regions where routine blood analysis may be done.
    Early diagnosis will be made and the disease’s death rate will go down as a result
    of the application that has been developed. With specific values, even medical
    professionals without specialized training can quickly and accurately identify
    this serious disease in its early stages. The use of powerful medications for
    the patient, which are utilized in the latter stages of the illness, as well as
    considerable time and expense savings from the need for these medications and
    surveillance, will be provided together with early detection and diagnosis. Prescanning
    can be performed quickly with the application. This application can simply be
    utilized as a substitute way in health decision support systems. In light of the
    findings obtained in future studies, a web-based diagnosis and prediction system
    can also be developed. References Santos TBd, Borges AKdM, Ferreira JD, Meira

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    is a huge network which associates computer systems globally. Through the internet
    connection, sharing and transferring data from anywhere on Earth can happen just
    in the blink of an eye. Network service providers give internet access to end
    users. This internet connection may be wired or wireless. Today, we communicate
    information by means of internet media using the classical interpretation as binary
    bits. A bit is an elementary component of the classical computer’s data or information
    processing system by which we communicate through the internet. There is a chance
    of noise interpreted over the information, and thereby, information is degraded
    or destroyed, even collapsed. The bit represents a logical state with truly binary
    values [1]. Confidential information is transmitted across an insecure communication
    channel within a network. As a result, there are potential hacking risks when
    sending information. In order to hide information, cybersecurity is crucial. Although
    the present encryption techniques are quantum secure, they are not safe for conventional
    systems. To solve this issue, the quantum internet aims to increase global security.
    The revelation of a quantum internet is to come up with new internet technology
    by aiding quantum communication between any two nodes. A network of quantum computers
    that compute, encode, and decode information is known as quantum internet. The
    quantum internet will not replace the traditional internet; it will offer additional
    features, such as quantum bit, quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, quantum
    communication, quantum encryption, and many more. The application of quantum computing
    is numerous, and commercial as well as non-commercial establishments are using
    them. This review paper is categorized as follows. Section 48.2 presents the relevant
    quantum computing theoretical concepts and definitions. The architecture of the
    quantum internet is presented in Sect. 48.3. Section 48.4 presents the quantum
    internet protocol. Section 48.5 presents a comparative study between classical
    internet with quantum internet. The literature review is presented in Sect. 48.6.
    Section 48.7 concludes the paper with future directions of research. 48.2 Quantum
    Computing Preliminaries A brief summary of quantum theoretic concepts is presented
    in this section. Quantum computing is an associative arena including mechanics,
    physics, and computer science features that resolve complex issues quicker than
    conventional computers. Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that lessons
    the manners of atoms at a macroscopic level. Quantum processors execute calculations
    in a brand-new manner using these features. 48.2.1 Concept of Quantum Bit The
    bit, represented as ‘0’ or ‘1’, is the most fundamental unit of the classical
    computing system to communicate with different devices through the internet. In
    quantum networking systems, these drawbacks are overcome with quantum mechanical
    properties [2]. Qubit is the most fundamental component of a quantum system where
    quantum data is transmitted using QKD principles. Qubits can be entangled and
    superimposed, which means two qubits share a strong connection in a distributed
    manner and stay in both states, i.e., |0⟩ and |1⟩. A qubit is denoted as |φ⟩ = β|0⟩ + γ|1⟩,
    where β and γ are probability amplitudes corresponding to finding |0⟩ and |1⟩,
    provided that β2 + γ2 = 1. Qubits have unlimited states using the superposition
    theorem (Fig. 48.1). Fig. 48.1 Bit and qubit Full size image 48.2.2 Quantum Measurement
    The quantum state of a system serves as its description in quantum mechanics.
    If the value of quantum characteristics is not measured, it has no existence [3].
    A quantum state is a vector within a complex vector space. Individual physical
    machine in quantum mechanics has a corresponding Hilbert space; each component
    denotes a feasible state for that system. 48.2.3 Quantum Logic Gates Quantum logic
    gates work like digital logical gates on classical computers. Logical quantum
    gates make quantum circuits. It has no loops because qubits can’t go back in time.
    Lines can’t spread out because of the no-cloning theorem [4]. Quantum wires are
    interconnected with quantum gates. The number and types of gates are the actual
    structure of a quantum circuit. The most important quantum gates are as follows:
    Single-Qubit Gates—The NOT logic gate is simple because it is reversible [4, 5].
    It is represented as. $$ \\begin{aligned} {\\text{NOT}}: & |\\left. 0 \\right\\rangle
    = |\\left. 1 \\right\\rangle \\\\ |\\left. 1 \\right\\rangle = |\\left. 0 \\right\\rangle
    . \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Multiple-Qubit Gates—In classical systems, any digital
    logic circuit can be built up from NAND gates, but in quantum circuits, NAND is
    not useful because of its irreversible feature. However, universal quantum logic
    gates are present in quantum systems. Controlled-NOT or C-NOT consists of two
    qubits as input. One qubit is called a target, and the other one is controlled.
    If and only if the control qubit is |1⟩, the C-NOT flips the target qubit [6].
    48.2.4 Quantum Superposition The most significant concept in quantum mechanics
    is quantum superposition [7]. In traditional computing, a computer can only be
    in one state at a time. Still, in quantum computing, superposition is the theorem
    to be in more than one state at the same time before measurement. The concept
    of quantum superposition might take a lot of work to visualize. For particles
    in the instance of quantum computing, it becomes duplicated but identical or effectively
    existing in two places at the same time. This overlapping of quantum bits gives
    quantum computers intrinsic parallelism, allowing them to perform lots of operations
    concurrently. 48.2.5 No-Cloning Theorem No-cloning is another important concept
    in quantum computing. According to no-cloning, it is impossible to replicate any
    quantum state into another state. Based on a fundamental distinction between quantum
    and classical systems, quantum key distribution is secured. Nonorthogonal states
    cannot be disturbed. $$ \\left( - \\right) \\otimes \\left( - \\right):V \\times
    V \\to V $$ Certain classical error-correcting methods cannot be applied to quantum
    states because of the no-cloning theorem. The no communication, which argues that
    quantum entanglement cannot be utilized to transfer classical information, implies
    the no-cloning theorem [8]. 48.2.6 Quantum Entanglement Erwin Schrödinger invented
    the entanglement of qubit states in 1935 [9]. Quantum entanglement is a quantum-level
    phenomenon where the states must be described relative to each other, even if
    the particles can be isolated. Quantum entanglement has always played a significant
    role in quantum communication systems. In general terms, quantum entanglement
    means that the difference between one element in an entangled pair depends on
    the difference between the other elements, no matter how far apart. When measuring
    the quantum state, the energy wave disappears and is measured as its ‘0’ or ‘1’
    state, and in the real or deterministic state, the qubit behaves like a standard
    bit. Entanglement is the ability of qubits to share their state with other qubits.
    48.3 Architecture of Quantum Internet The architecture of the quantum internet,
    elementary concepts of edge node, quantum repeater, quantum switch, and quantum
    channel are presented in this section. Also, the application and challenges of
    the quantum internet are discussed here. Quantum communication uses qubits to
    exchange any information to the independent and multiple quantum nodes in a network.
    Quantum channels connect quantum nodes, but they are physically separated. Sending
    information through quantum channels is more secure than conventional ones. Only
    on the quantum internet is a quantum computer sending quantum data, quantum bits,
    from one place to another. Although yet in its early stages of research, the quantum
    internet has major effects in a variety of fields. A connection between multiple
    isolated quantum nodes over a quantum channel is called quantum internet. The
    laws of quantum mechanics are the driving force behind this revolutionary technology.
    The quantum internet is a network that will enable information flow between quantum
    nodes [10, 11]. An illustration of the Fig. 48.2 is presented below [10]. Fig.
    48.2 Structure of quantum internet Full size image Edge Node—Edge nodes are important
    and basic conditions of the quantum internet. It is required for long-distance
    communications. These nodes are quantum systems consisting of at least one qubit.
    Quantum Repeater—No-cloning theorem prevents classical telecommunication in quantum
    communication [12]. To solve this issue, quantum repeater protocols were developed,
    which, through entanglement swapping, produce long-distance entanglement from
    shorter-distance entanglement [9]. The ability to temporarily store the quantum
    information conveyed by photons in a quantum memory is necessary for understanding
    quantum repeaters in the real world, which is quite interesting. Quantum repeater
    is very important in long-distance communication systems [12]. There are four
    ways to perform the task, i.e., (1) entanglement between node to node, (2) entanglement
    stretching, (3) error management, and (4) network management. Quantum Switch—The
    quantum switch offers an edge in computation for several issues. Security and
    performance are designed and implemented by the quantum switch and are also cost-effective.
    Qubit regulates the order of a quantum switch made up of two quantum channels.
    In any case, the quantum switch applies an action 1 that can be trailed by other
    action 2 or reversibly [13, 14]. Quantum Channel—In communication through a quantum
    channel, the sender encrypts a message secretly, the receiver decrypts it, and
    the entire communication is perceived through a quantum system. The quantum encoder
    scheme differs from the classical system; quantum states send information over
    quantum channels [15, 16]. 48.3.1 Quantum Teleportation Quantum teleportation
    represents an important concept in quantum computing [17, 18]. Teleportation is
    a system that uses entangled states to send quantum information from one place
    to another in quantum networks. Given the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics,
    teleportation is the best option in this situation to prevent an attempt by an
    eavesdropper to obtain the key instantaneously. 48.3.2 Applications of Quantum
    Internet The applications of the quantum internet are classified according to
    the following genre [19, 20]: Quantum-based Cryptography—It is a secure mode of
    encryption that conveys information in a technique that is not possible to hack.
    Quantum-based cryptography is the method of encoding and securing the information
    so that the authentic one has the exact secret key to decode it. QKD protocol
    is used for secure communication. Quantum-Based Sensors—Quantum sensing is the
    latest technique that utilizes quantum mechanics principles to develop new kinds
    of sensing devices. Quantum sensors have higher accuracy, sensitivity, and precision.
    Along with quantum-based computation, simulation, and communication, it is incorporated
    into the group of quantum technologies. Distributed sensors are also supported
    in this technology. Accurate clock synchronization is possible with the help of
    this technique. 48.3.3 Challenges of Quantum Internet Decoherence—The idea behind
    quantum coherence is that an individual object has been divided into two distinct
    wave functions. Qubits are breakable, so the loss of information in quantum computing
    is called decoherence. To compute, the qubits should pair, measure their conditions,
    and then be reserved free of communications that cause noise and decoherence.
    Ecological factors are the basic reasons to collapse a qubit. There is an immense
    challenge in the making of a quantum computer designed with various features that
    try to interrupt the decoherence. Quantum decoherence occurs when there is no
    longer a certain phase relation between the two different states [21]. Imperfections
    of Quantum Teleportation—Since every way of communication is not perfect, so in
    quantum communication, imperfect quantum teleportation is normal. Decoherence
    is the cause of this type of imperfection. It also influences the quantum teleportation
    method as well as causes quantum entanglement and quantum distribution methods.
    Quantum communication suffers from ecological communications and loss of photons
    carrying qubits. Qubits are very fragile in nature, so at the time of interaction,
    some of the qubits are absolutely missing from the quantum environment [22]. Distribution
    of Entanglement—One of the major challenges for the quantum internet is the distribution
    of entanglement among different nodes present in the quantum network. It is a
    vital component of quantum mechanics. Entanglement swapping is a technique for
    dispersing the correlation between remote systems. In a quantum network, this
    technique helps to associate distinct nodes for long-distance communication. It
    is a key component of quantum cryptography as well as quantum computing and is
    very helpful for teleportation [23] (Fig. 48.3). Fig. 48.3 Entanglement swapping
    Full size image 48.4 Quantum Internet Protocol QKD and other protocols utilize
    quantum mechanics principles in quantum cryptography to build a secured cryptosystem
    [24]. Quantum cryptography is an entirely secure encryption process where secret
    information is exchanged between sender and receiver. Data replication or modification
    in quantum encryption is impossible because this method instantly alerts the sender
    and receiver. These protocols detect the existence of an eavesdropper in the cryptosystem
    who is trying to learn the key. So, this encryption provides secure communication
    and detects eavesdropping in an efficient manner. Bennett and Brassard invented
    quantum key distribution in 1984 [25]. QKD is the major key to providing secure
    communication in quantum networks. QKD is grounded on the elementary ideologies
    of no-cloning and the HUP theorem. QKD is a key sharing technology between two
    real users, ‘A’ and ‘B’. ‘A’ and ‘B’ are separated and want to send a confidential
    message without knowing the third party. So, quantum is added to this part. ‘A’
    and ‘B’ use entangled qubits to generate a unique encryption key. If hacker ‘E’
    tries to steal the key, the eavesdropping is detected immediately. In contrast
    to conventional cryptography, QKD uses principles of quantum mechanics to provide
    absolutely secured key cryptography. This type of method can detect the presence
    of a listener on the system trying to learn the key. In QKD, ‘A’ and ‘B’ have
    access to two communication channels, i.e., a private quantum communication channel
    that shares keys through the exchange of quantum particles and classical public
    communication that is shared, has error correction, and extension of privacy [26].
    In this way, the quantum internet ensures that quantum communication is more secure
    (Fig. 48.4). Fig. 48.4 Basic QKD model Full size image 48.4.1 BB84 Protocol Bennett
    and Brassard invented the BB84, based on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in
    1984. This is the most significant quantum protocol among other protocols [27].
    In the BB84 protocol as shown in Fig. 48.5, ‘A’ can provide an arbitrary secret
    key to ‘B’ by transferring photons. No-cloning theorem assures that the eavesdropper
    cannot measure the photons and sends them to ‘B’ without changing the photon’s
    state. Fig. 48.5 Flowchart of BB84 Full size image ‘A’ forwards a random state
    from {|0⟩, |0⟩, |+⟩, |−⟩}, each time B correctly guesses the basis, they receive
    a bit of the key. 48.4.2 Quantum Communication The most famous application of
    quantum internet is to use it for secure communication. Internet is the most crucial
    part of daily routine, and secure communication is the key objective in this period
    [28, 29]. So, secure communication means one sends the data to another one without
    any hazard. This security issue is resolved through cryptographic methods that
    secure the information with the help of a secret key. In quantum cryptography,
    no-cloning plays a vital part in ensuring the transferred data’s integrity and
    privacy. In classical communication, sender and receiver used common key encryption.
    This encryption is hard to break but not impossible. QKD offers a protected approach
    to enter in cloud systems using various protocols. Three key objectives are involved
    in quantum communications: safely delivering qubits across distances, creating
    shared entanglement across distances, and creating hidden and quantum-secured
    data [30]. So, a quantum computer promises to solve many issues much faster than
    a classical computer. The block diagram is shown in Fig. 48.6 [31]. Fig. 48.6
    Block diagram of quantum communication Full size image 48.4.3 Quantum Networks
    Incorporating a quantum communication system is now possible with a quantum network.
    Quantum networks use entanglement, superposition, and no-cloning properties, which
    are not present in classical networks. So, this network is inherently secure.
    It enables the parties to create long-distance quantum entanglement, which is
    useful for a variety of activities like creating multiparty-shared secrets whose
    security depends on distributed quantum computing and enhances sensing on encrypted
    data. Most of the time, quantum networks function similarly to classical networks
    [32]. But some specific issues can be resolved more effectively with it. The architecture
    of the quantum network is depicted in Fig. 48.7 [10, 31]. Fig. 48.7 Quantum network
    architecture Full size image 48.5 Comparative study between classical internet
    with quantum internet David Awschalom said, “The quantum internet represents a
    paradigm shift …”. Quantum networks enable information transmission through quantum
    bits between substantially isolated quantum systems [33]. Some elementary key
    differences between the traditional and quantum internet are listed in Table 48.1.
    Table 48.1 Elementary differences between the traditional internet and quantum
    internet Full size table 48.6 Summary of Related Works Jiajun Chen [31] covered
    a complete description of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement,
    applications of quantum communication, and the strengths and weaknesses of quantum
    networks. Ramakrishnan et al. [32] mainly focused on the quantum resources and
    architecture related to quantum computing. The review is based on circuits, photons,
    and the quantum repeaters engaged in a quantum internet. Singh et al. [29] presented
    a thorough and impressive explanation of the fundamental principles of quantum
    mechanics, qubits and quantum logic gates, quantum entanglement, quantum communication,
    quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum networks. Singh et al.
    [24] investigated the security of several quantum cryptographic techniques and
    quantum key distribution mechanisms. The study is useful for finding the characteristics
    of different QKD mechanisms, including the pros and cons. Laghari et al. [33]
    discussed the advancements in networks, communication, and quantum computing.
    They also highlighted the merits and demerits of using quantum computing. Meter
    et al. [10] described existing quantum internet architectures. They also implemented
    a scalable quantum simulator and proposed a new architecture based on the existing
    one. Das et al. [14] talked about quantum communication using higher order quantum
    switches, a very useful resource for communicating through quantum channels. Although
    noisy quantum channels act like normal quantum channels. Tao Liu [18] covered
    a complete description of teleportation, its applications, and challenges. Wehner
    et al. [19] presented a brief overview of the quantum internet, its stages, application,
    protocols, and long-distance trusted communication problems. A comparative illustration

    48.7 Conclusion The paper accomplishes the fact that quantum computing is still
    in its initial stages. It is always an intriguing idea to combine quantum theory,
    physics, computational science, mathematics, and mechanics. The paper discusses
    the different areas of quantum computing, like quantum networks, quantum cryptography,
    quantum protocols, quantum communication, and quantum internet. Quantum internet
    has many applications that are impossible to explain on the classical internet
    today, although it can achieve many things in a more efficient manner. The main
    challenge in quantum internet is long-distance communication. Some quantum information
    is lost during the transmission process. To solve this issue, the quantum repeater
    enables entanglement swapping, which helps to associate discrete nodes for long-distance
    communication. However, there still remain some more challenges and issues that
    need to be resolved. References Fagbolu, O.O.: Comparative analysis of classical

    conference paper PDF 53.1 Introduction Please note that the first traditional
    database is typically based on the technology of centralization. The centralization
    technology prevents making it famous and trustworthy in terms of use among the
    masses. A decentralized distributed database has been introduced very soon, centrally
    managed by a service provider. The service provider requires engineering implementation,
    business support, and hardware requirements on a very large scale. In this context,
    blockchain is an initiative of public collaboration. The participants of the blockchain
    system own the responsibility for carrying out the process. Blockchain is a secured
    database shared across a network of participants, where all the participants can
    access the information simultaneously. Blockchain technology is an advanced database
    mechanism that allows information sharing within a network. Blockchain database
    stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain [1,2,3,4,5]. The data
    is chronologically consistent because no one can modify or delete the chain without
    consent from the network. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts,
    production, etc. Blockchain is used to record, verify, and confirm digital assets
    and transactions in a secure way. A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchanging
    money. The most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created to facilitate transactions
    without third parties. The Bitcoin blockchain refers to the data stored in “blocks”
    that are then linked together in a permanent “chain.” A block is a collection
    of Bitcoin transactions from a specific period [6,7,8]. Bitcoin is the world’s
    first digital currency. This paper is organized as follows. Section 53.2 presents
    classical blockchain theoretical concepts and definitions. The quantum blockchain
    is presented in Sect. 53.3. Advantages and applications of quantum blockchain
    are represented in Sect. 53.4. The literature review is presented in Sect. 53.5.
    Section 53.6 concludes the paper with future directions of research. 53.2 Blockchain
    Preliminaries The following subsections discuss the fundamental concepts of a
    blockchain. 53.2.1 Blockchain Transaction A blockchain transaction is a process
    where data is transmitted in the form of blocks across the network in a blockchain
    system (Fig. 53.1). Fig. 53.1 A typical diagram of a block in a blockchain Full
    size image BLOCK: A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously
    increasing list of blocks. Each block holds a cryptographic hash and some information
    about the previous block. Data is divided into common blocks using unique cryptographic
    hashes. DATA: This is the raw form of information. NONCE: “Number used only once.”
    A NONCE is generated when a block is created in a blockchain. Later it helps to
    produce a block header hash. HASH: Hash is a hexadecimal number in a deterministic
    form. Whatever the count of characters in an input, the number of characters is
    fixed in the hash. For example, hashes in Bitcoin always consist of 64 bits. 53.2.2
    Types of Blockchain Public Blockchain: A public blockchain is the first type of
    blockchain. This blockchain is open to all. It is a permissionless distributed
    ledger where any node can join and perform any transactions. Depending on in what
    manner and how many nodes are involved, public blockchains are safe [9]. Private
    Blockchain: The next type of blockchain is a private blockchain, which operates
    quickly. This blockchain is not as decentralized as the public one; only selected
    nodes can participate in it, making it more secure than other blockchains. Consortium
    Blockchain: Another type of blockchain is consortium blockchain [10]. This is
    an innovative method to solve the organization’s needs. In this system, some part
    is public, and some part is private, and the organization manages this type of
    blockchain. Hybrid Blockchain: Hybrid blockchain is the mixed content of the private
    and public blockchain. In a hybrid blockchain, transactions and records are typically
    private and can be validated, if necessary, by granting access. 53.2.3 Technologies
    Used in Blockchain Timestamp: Nakamoto developed timestamps based on the use of
    hash-based proof of work. A timestamp server takes the hash of a block containing
    transactions to be timestamped and published on the network. By doing so, the
    server ensures that the transactions have existed at this point in time. This
    system is chronologically enforced as each transaction hash contains the timestamp
    of the previous block of transactions, forming a chain of blocks. Hash Algorithm:
    The hash function takes an input string of any length and converts it into a fixed
    length. After extracting data from the block, the hash outputs the length with
    the help of some algorithm. Real-time transactions are carried out with special
    hash algorithms. Hashes give each block in the blockchain a unique identifier.
    The block identifier can be found in the block header. A lot of components are
    required to construct the block. Therefore, the data is turned into a unique string
    inside the block when a blockchain hash occurs. Cryptographic hashes (like SHA2,
    SHA3, and BLAKE2) are considered quantum-safe [11, 12]. A hash function, H() takes
    a message N of any size and calculates a short, fixed-size digest H(N), typically
    256 or 512 bits long. Hash functions are secure when. 1. Given A, find a message
    N, such that H(N) = A, and 2. N1 and N2 such that H(N1) = H(N2) Proof of Work
    (PoW): PoW [3, 13]is a fundamental underlying technology behind blockchain cryptocurrency.
    It has been previously pointed out that quantum systems provide a computational
    advantage in performing PoW in the context of Bitcoin. This has strong consequences
    regarding both quantum-based attacks on the integrity of the entirety of the blockchain
    and more legitimate uses of quantum computation for the purpose of mining Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies. For the first case, we estimate when these quantum
    attacks will become feasible for various cryptocurrencies and discuss the impact
    of such attacks. We derive a precise formula for the latter to calculate the economic
    incentive for switching to quantum-based cryptocurrency miners. Using this formula,
    we analyze several test scenarios and conclude that investing in quantum hardware
    for cryptocurrency mining has the potential to pay off immensely. Bitcoin is a
    cryptocurrency which uses the PoW consensus algorithm SHA256. Proof of Stake (PoS):
    In a blockchain, transactions are validated by some consensus mechanism. Cryptocurrency
    holders stake their coins through PoS [3, 13]. They validate the next latest blocks
    of transactions and add them to the system. PoS is costly and more energy efficient
    than PoW. PoS consensus algorithms are EOS (EOS), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA),
    Cosmos (ATOM), and Lisk (LSK). PoS is derived from PoW with some improvements.
    The whole network is not involved in the validation of each transaction. The validator
    does not sustain a block reward. Instead, they only accumulate network costs as
    their reward. Delegated Proof of Stake: Daniel Larimer, Steemit, and EOS introduced
    the fundamental concept of delegated proof of stake [3, 13]. According to this
    consensus algorithm, users can rightly cast their vote or delegate the power of
    voting to another entity to cast a vote on their behalf. The witness is selected
    to create blocks after verifying transactions. After successfully verifying all
    the transactions, the witness receives rewards that they share with those who
    voted for that particular witness. In case of failing to verify all transactions
    in the allotted time, the block is missed, and no rewards are given. The next
    witness verifies that unverified block and a reward is given to that witness along
    with the ones who are casted votes for this new witness. Such blocks are called
    “Stolen.” Proof of Authority (PoA): In consensus algorithm called proof of authority
    was proposed by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and Parity Technology [14].
    The nodes which are proven their validity to generate new blocks are called “validators.”
    The process of validation of the blocks is automated and runs by software that
    is controlled by validators. The validators need not to monitor the system constantly
    but must maintain that the system must not be compromised. In PoA, the validators
    are collecting reputations instead of coins. It is secured by the faith of the
    identities selected. 53.2.4 Challenges of Blockchain With increasing popularity,
    blockchain meets some critical challenges [3, 13] in respect of security and authentication,
    which can be summarized as follows. Scalability: Every transaction in the blockchain
    must check the authenticity of the source of that particular transaction before
    entering to the ledger. As a result, in real time, the ledger is overwhelmed by
    enormous transactional records. Small transactions have more latency rate. For
    this scalability issue, Bruce proposed a storage optimization method. This method
    suggests deleting the old transactional records from the ledger. But that is not
    enough to dissolve this problem in a large context. Privacy: In blockchain technology,
    users’ identity is unspecified during the creation and verification of transactions
    using their public and private keys. All the participants of a particular blockchain
    transaction can view all the data. So, the safety of transactions might be void.
    Data Malleability: Securing data integrity is one of the big challenges in blockchain
    technology. The signature that is used to verify a transaction doesn’t guarantee
    any authenticity regarding the signature itself. As a result, if any intruder
    acts as a signing authority, it is very difficult to recognize. Authentication:
    In a blockchain, a user has to provide their own details to create the identity.
    However, there is no scope to verify whether the details provided by them are
    actually genuine or not. The users are responsible for carrying out the most crucial
    role of authenticating a transaction. The private keys that are used to authenticate
    the transactions might be altered. Consequently, the whole system may be corrupted,
    resulting in a huge loss. 53.2.5 Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency plays a vital role
    in the modern financial sector. It utilizes blockchain as a financial platform.
    Cryptocurrency is protected by public key cryptography. Ethereum and Bitcoin are
    well-known cryptocurrency systems [15]. 53.3 Quantum Blockchain Quantum computing
    is a method to solve complex problems using the laws of quantum mechanics [16].
    Quantum blockchain is a combination of quantum computation and blockchain. Quantum
    blockchain can be understood as a decentralized, encrypted, and distributed database.
    Once the information is recorded in the quantum blockchain, the information cannot
    be changed without the permission of the network. The security of blockchain works
    with hash function and distribution. It uses a peer-to-peer network connection
    where the decentralized architecture allows nodes to share and access resources
    directly. Blockchain tracks transactions and prevents double and fake transactions
    [17,18,19,20,21]. 53.3.1 Quantum Cryptography Encoding and decoding data is the
    main concept behind any cryptography. The cryptographic key is one of the most
    important features in of cryptography. The strength of any encryption depends
    on the encryption key. Cryptography is used for several purposes, including transaction,
    verification, and validation of any digital assets securely. Random cryptographic
    keys are generated through quantum technologies, which are totally secure. Quantum
    tunneling is very much unpredictable and generates a cryptographically secure
    pseudorandom number. Digital asset uses quantum cryptography than classical cryptography
    for more security [22,23,24,25]. Quantum cryptography assures the reliability
    of transactions on a quantum network. Quantum networks have no requirement for
    PoW or PoS consensus algorithm. 53.3.2 QKD The advantage of quantum cryptography
    is that it allows one to complete several cryptographical tasks, which is impossible
    by classical communication. In a quantum state, copying the encrypted data is
    not possible. The no-cloning theorem will alter the quantum state if anyone tries
    to decode the data. This is used to sense snooping in QKD. Quantum cryptography
    encrypts data for an extended duration than classical cryptography [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33].
    Blockchain handles a lot of sensitive data, and secrecy must be maintained while
    the data is in transit. QKD will be a key technology for secure communications
    systems in the quantum Internet. The workflow of QKD is depicted in Fig. 53.2
    [34]. Fig. 53.2 QKD flowchart Full size image 53.3.3 Quantum Digital Signature
    Quantum physics is the fundamental principle for digital signature. To protect
    a legal document, a digital signature is needed. A digital signature scheme follows
    some steps for authentication. First, the key-generating process generates a verification
    key and an authorization key. Then a signing process takes the authorization key
    and produces an authorization of the message. At last, a verification process
    takes the verification key and verifies whether the signature is valid [35, 36].
    A typical processing (signing and verification) of a digital signature in a classical
    blockchain and a digital signature in a quantum blockchain are shown in Figs.
    53.3 and 53.4, respectively. Fig. 53.3 Block diagram of digital signature in classical
    blockchain Full size image Fig. 53.4 Block diagram of digital signature in quantum
    blockchain Full size image 53.4 Advantages and Applications of Quantum Blockchain
    Advantages of Quantum Blockchain Improved Security: Quantum blockchain possesses
    the ability to provide more secure data. Due to the unique features of superposition,
    entanglement, and teleportation, data alteration is next to impossible at the
    time of creation, transmission, and storing. Increased Efficiency: Quantum blockchain
    can process transmission faster than classical one. The technique can handle data
    in a large volume. So, larger data handling with exponentially faster processing
    time makes it very efficient. Compatibility with Various Areas: Quantum blockchain
    has the capacity to be applicable in different sectors with great skill. Upcoming
    research may lead to a vivid acceptance of this technology in almost every sphere
    of computation. Applications of Quantum Blockchain Healthcare: Medical data gains
    a phenomenal importance after pandemic hits the globe [37, 38]. To maintain the
    secrecy of electronic health records, blockchain-inspired architecture is utilized.
    To fix the quantum attack, quantum digital signature is applied. Apart from this,
    contact tracing process in the recent pandemic is also boosted up by exerting
    quantum blockchain. Smart City: Smart cities have miscellaneous devices to execute
    the city routines [39, 40]. These devices often use the wireless sensors which
    require authenticity of servers. Classical blockchain technology provides smooth
    performance to maintain the originality and security of data that is used to transmit
    or store. But after the appearance of quantum attacks, the safety is broken. Application
    of quantum blockchain makes it secured, feasible, and easygoing. Cryptocurrency:
    The modern society reaches to the sharp tip where the mass uses the cryptocurrency
    instead of physical currency [41]. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the top most examples.
    Cryptocurrency solely depends upon blockchain technology. But, in the recent past
    that faced a number of quantum attacks. To sort out this serious issue, different
    post-quantum techniques are prescribed. In spite of that, upcoming advancement
    of quantum world may endanger the existing security, given by existing post-quantum
    techniques. Therefore, the quantum blockchain is the only solution for delivering
    the loyalty for secure transactions and storing of cryptocurrency. The above discussion
    on the applications of quantum blockchain ensures to furnish a conception about
    it. The idea is mostly theoretical which needs to become practical by the time
    ahead. 53.5 Summary of Related Works Chen et al. [42] worked on the purposes of
    privacy for users, signature likeability, and contact tracking, a lattice-based
    ring signature technique and proposed a new method on these parameters. They also
    evaluated the possibility of quantum computing attacks in their proposed system
    and prescribed possible ways that may prevent them. Qu et al. [43] suggested using
    a quantum-based detectable Byzantine agreement for the part of the digital signature
    where data is encrypted for privacy preservation. It is based on the GHZ state
    that an n-party quantum blockchain''s data consensus protocol realizes. Gupta
    et al. [44] discussed blockchain security in relation to secure electronic voting,
    utilizing the QKD and SHA-256 hashing algorithms. They also provided a detailed
    explanation of how electronic voting is executed. Zhanji Xu [45] discussed a classical
    algorithm utilized in traditional blockchain technology. They also pointed out
    how the impending quantum era might alter it both favorably and unfavorably. Information
    on the most recent developments among organizations researching the same field
    was jotted down meticulously. Bistarelli et al. [46] introduced an implementation
    of an interface in an Ethereum node to support several digital signature schemes.
    This research opened the door in front of future researchers for bettering the
    digital signature schemes that would be invented in the time ahead. Table 53.1
    presents a critical comparison of these notable research contributions. Table

    Full size table 53.6 Conclusion The state of blockchain technology touches the
    point of climax where it faces issues regarding security and privacy-preserving
    concurrently with the advancement. The earliest stage of quantum computing already
    questions the efficiency of classical blockchain. However, besides this the quantum
    computing provides a strong ray of hope in the form of quantum blockchain technology.
    In this paper, we investigate the obstacles those stands in front of so-called
    well-built security and authentication features given by classical blockchain.
    We also try to spot out the missing links that are the drawbacks of traditional
    blockchain technology, but can be removed by quantum blockchain. After observing
    the issue sensitively, it is found that the digital signing process used in signing
    the message has a big issue due to the protocols applied. These protocols could
    be easily violated by quantum attacks. In this purview, QKD, quantum cryptography,
    quantum-inspired protocols, quantum channels are tuned into the game changers
    of the whole scenario. And in a nutshell, the above-mentioned parameters are denoted
    as quantum blockchain technology. The observation table in the literature review
    section indicates the vast application areas that are aimed to be undertaken as
    present and upcoming interest. Lastly, it could be concluded that the discussed
    field of research is at its childhood state and the continuous development may
    uplift computer science to a stunning height in the near future. References Pierro,

    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) refers to a particular class of ad-hoc networks
    made up of small sensor nodes that can perceive, analyze, and transmit data over
    a shared wireless channel [1]. In a WSN, sensors typically communicate wirelessly
    with a centralized base station (or head), transmitting the perceived data from
    a particular area. Deployment in open and unattended environments opens up the
    possibility of security attacks. This is because an insider is allowed to participate
    in the network and have complete access to all communications routed over the
    network, with the ability to alter, dampen, or eavesdrop on the contents [2].
    This makes intrusion detection a critical task in WSNs to protect against security
    threats. Intrusion detection systems capable of detecting break-in attempts and
    protecting sensitive information from attackers are being devised by researchers.
    Machine learning (ML) approaches have become a common choice for building intrusion
    detection models due to their adaptability, scalability, and effectiveness in
    recognizing abnormal network behavior. These models are trained to identify intrusions,
    making them a valuable tool for enhancing WSN security. Common ML techniques used
    in WSN intrusion detection include Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random
    Forests, Neural Networks, and Clustering algorithms, among others [3]. Designing
    an efficient security system in WSNs and ensuring timely and accurate detection
    of intrusions within WSN is highly significant due to their unique constraints
    and deployment scenarios. Sinkhole attacks are among the most prevalent types
    of attacks [4]. Since it makes it easier for the attackers to carry out subsequent
    activities or some other attacks, it is a serious attack directed against the
    network layer. In an effort to completely disable the network’s functionality,
    adversaries try to influence traffic flows, latency, and other network aspects
    [5]. The identification of sinkhole attacks during data transmission is a significant
    problem because hostile attackers may get access to information from the data
    transferred through wireless channels. This underscores the significance of ongoing
    research and development efforts to address these challenges effectively. Among
    different attacks on WSNs, a sinkhole attack has the potential to hinder a network’s
    efficacy by enticing adjacent nodes with misleading information and facilitating
    the initiation of subsequent attacks [6, 7]. Sinkhole attacks can cause data packets
    to be discarded or manipulated as they transit through the hijacked node. With
    false routing path information, it draws nearby nodes and executes data forging
    or selective forwarding of data that passes through it. It can result in energy
    holes in WSNs by draining the energy of neighboring nodes, as well as unfair and
    sometimes harmful reactions based on erroneous data [8]. Although several methods
    to identify sinkhole attacks in WSNs have been presented in the literature, the
    accuracy and robustness of detecting a real attacker remain key issues. The efficacy
    of detection algorithms relies heavily on their accuracy in attack detection [9,10,11].
    Given the shortcomings of current solutions, it is crucial to devise new and enhanced
    methods that can identify attacks affecting WSNs in a more rapid and accurate
    manner. With this motivation, our research presents a novel intrusion detection
    model for sinkhole attack detection, called Time Synchronized Multivariate Regressive
    Convolution Deep Neural Network (TSMR-CDNN). The main objective of TSMR-CDNN is
    to enhance attack detection accuracy and legitimate node identification with minimum
    delay. TSMR-CDNN involves different attributes that, when combined, offer numerous
    advantages including improved attack detection accuracy, precise legitimate node
    identification, minimal detection delay, utilization of multivariate data for
    comprehensive analysis, reduced temporal complexity, and a lower false positive
    rate. These features collectively contribute to enhanced network security and
    intrusion detection in the context of sinkhole attacks. By using the convolution
    deep neural network with multiple layers for data processing, it can effectively
    differentiate between normal network behavior and malicious activities, resulting
    in higher detection accuracy. TSMR-CDNN is designed to minimize detection delay
    with the use of time synchronization mechanisms and precise clock skew information.
    In TSMR-CDNN, the reverse time synchronization mechanism is employed, considering
    that it can provide precise clock skews and offsets. The head node (i.e., base
    station) uses this to extract the sensor nodes’ clock characteristics and radio
    information. The model incorporates the utilization of multivariate data, including
    clock features, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Link Quality Indicator
    (LQI), and energy levels, for enhancing its detection capabilities. The estimated
    values are analyzed by applying Broken-stick regression, which uses threshold
    values to examine the multivariate data. In order to reduce the temporal complexity
    of attack detection, the Hardlimit activation function is subsequently applied
    to simultaneously identify legitimate nodes and detect sinkhole attacks. To minimize
    the false positive rate, the steepest gradient function is used in updating the
    weight parameter. This minimizes the error rate and leads to better classification
    results. Together, these attributes of TSMR-CDNN significantly strengthen network
    security and enhance intrusion detection capabilities, particularly in the context
    of countering sinkhole attacks. The major contributions of TSMR-CDNN are listed
    below. We propose a novel intrusion detection model called TSMR-CDNN to enhance
    the accuracy of sinkhole attack detection in WSN. We propose and employ the Reverse
    time synchronization mechanism to extract the clock skew features and radio information
    at the base station. We utilize the advantages of Broken-stick regression for
    analyzing the estimated features with the threshold value. To minimize the temporal
    complexity of detecting attacks, we adopt the Hardlimit activation function for
    identifying legitimate sensor nodes and detecting sinkhole attacks. We employ
    the Steepest gradient function for updating the weight parameters in order to
    minimize the false positive rate and to obtain the final better classification
    results. We perform extensive simulation analysis using different performance
    metrics such as attack detection accuracy, F-measure, recall, precision, and detection
    time. The remainder of the paper is split into the following sections: Sect. 2
    covers the related works. Section 3 details the TSMR-CDNN model. The detailed
    experimental setup and simulation analysis are presented in Sect. 4. Finally,
    Sect. 5 provides the concluding remarks. 2 Related Works Due to WSN’s constraints,
    it is difficult to mitigate security vulnerabilities, and as a result, several
    sorts of attacks are carried out to exploit WSN by attackers. To identify network
    attacks, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed. These
    methods often have to deal with the issue of inaccurate detection, either false
    positives or false negatives. Machine learning methods have been widely utilized
    for enhancing the efficiency of IDS-related aspects as well as adaptability. To
    accurately identify nodes and detect spoofing attacks, a node detection approach
    against spoofing attacks (NISA) was presented in [1]. Based on spatially correlated
    radio details, NISA enables defense against spoofing threats. Two types of NISA
    system implementation, referred to as central NISA and distributed NISA, respectively,
    were discussed. However, the computational complexity of attack detection was
    not improved by adopting a more advanced thresholding technique. For the detection
    of intrusions, a deep neural network based on a cross-correlation procedure to
    choose the best features was introduced in [2]. With this method, the model’s
    computational cost and data size are both reduced to the minimum. To identify
    the network intrusion, deep neural networks were deployed. However, it proved
    ineffective in improving the classification accuracy of the model. To guard against
    sinkhole attacks in the IoT ecosystem, an intrusion detection mechanism was devised
    in [3]. A strategy based on rich-resourced edge nodes was presented to identify
    sinkholes in IoT. When compared to earlier studies, the method improved false
    rate prediction by 0.37%. However, the time consumption of sinkhole attack detection
    was high. To guarantee data integrity during transmission, a lightweight and reliable
    technique was created in [4] based on the energy-effective WSN technique. The
    authors suggest a lightweight watermark technique that embeds the watermarking
    data using homomorphic cryptography and hash functions in addition to the sensor
    data. Energy usage, operational efficiency, delay, and packet delivery rate were
    all investigated. However, ML techniques were not implemented to detect the types
    of attacks in WSN transmission. A hop count-based detection approach was introduced
    in [5] to identify the consequences of sinkhole attacks. The performance was compared
    with Ibrahim’s algorithm. To evaluate the detrimental effects of the sinkhole
    attack, the ratio of packets delivered and the proportion of packets lost were
    also examined. The findings show that the functionality of the network is adversely
    affected by the sinkhole attack. The likelihood of detection and false positives,
    however, could not be precisely predicted. However, the set of rules was not specifically
    designed to detect the most common attacks, particularly in the case of sinkhole
    attacks. A specification-based mechanism for identifying intrusions based on the
    volume of input and output interactions was devised in [6]. In this work, the
    quantity of input/output transmissions gathered during the monitoring phase was
    used to establish rules utilizing an IDS specification-based method. Knowledge
    base rules were defined for normal functionality thresholds. Various guidelines
    were developed according to the contribution that every node makes towards increasing
    the sinkhole attack detection rates. However, the set of rules was not specifically
    defined to particularly detect sinkhole attacks. A novel mobile agent-based approach
    was introduced in [7] to identify and prevent sinkhole attacks based on the neighbors’
    reputation concept. In order to recognize and counteract sinkhole attacks, it
    makes use of each node’s trust score. To learn about the reputations of the nodes’
    neighbors, trust values are generated for each node. However, it failed to apply
    fuzzy logic to improve the detection of malicious nodes. It has not been demonstrated
    that the identification of malicious nodes has improved significantly. An artificial
    neural network model was developed in [8] for energy-based intrusion detection
    with lesser mean square error. Qualnet simulation was adopted to assess the network
    performance. The method uses an artificial neural network method to optimize the
    energy-based IDS. However, the amount of time required for the detection of intrusions
    was not reduced. An intrusion detection method was designed in [9] to protect
    the Edge-Based IoT environment against sinkhole attacks. A security study of the
    method is discussed to demonstrate its resistance to different sinkhole attacker
    variants. However, the detection of attacks with greater accuracy was a major
    challenging issue. The RFTrust model was developed in [10] to provide a lightweight
    solution for recognizing and eliminating sinkhole nodes based on trust parameters.
    By identifying and eliminating sinkhole nodes within the network, the method enhances
    trustworthy routing in the IoT context. A mathematical study is also presented
    to show the effectiveness of the method. A new detection technique was introduced
    in [11] against sinkhole attacks by measuring the Euclidean distance between sensor
    nodes and the head node. Though the technique enhanced the attack detection accuracy,
    the computation time was not reduced. An ML-based intrusion detection approach
    was developed in [12] for various types of attack detection. A new approach for
    the IoT-based WSN was developed in [13] for improving the network lifetime and
    stability using the association rule mining concept. However, the designed approach
    involves high computational complexity. An effective and safe data collection
    strategy for IoT was developed in [14]. But it was unable to handle deeper attack
    patterns. A compressive sensing-based encryption/decryption model was introduced
    in [15] using the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm for attack detection.
    But machine learning algorithm was not applied to enhance the performance of attack
    detection accuracy. A distributed denial-of-service attack detection model was
    proposed in [16] based on reoccurring spoofed ACK packets during the data transmission.
    A node authentication and spoofing detection method was developed in [17] using
    a machine learning approach for application in real-world WSN. In order to prevent
    the receiving end from becoming overloaded, it has been determined that a delay
    of 23 ms is the best. The findings showed that transmission session overload has
    an impact on DDOS success. However, the accuracy of attack detection was not improved.
    Artificial Intelligence algorithm was introduced in [18] for recognition and mitigation
    of wormhole attacks. However, better attack detection accuracy was not achieved.
    In [19], a multi-layer intrusion detection strategy was presented, utilizing a
    Naive Bayes classifier for making decisions on the examined packets in WSNs. However,
    it failed to improve the performance of a multi-layer intrusion detection model
    using deep learning techniques. For the purpose of identifying fraudulent nodes,
    [20] created a fuzzy-based reputation technique, which is subsequently optimized
    by applying an Artificial Bee Colony optimizer for spotting fraudulent nodes.
    To increase efficacy, the fitness function includes recommended deviation and
    interaction index deviation. According to simulation studies, even when the proportion
    of fraudulent nodes approaches 50%, the method retains a high rate of detection
    and an acceptable false-positive rate. However, it failed to examine the implications
    of dynamic thresholds and weights on the efficacy of the system. In [21], data
    encryption was employed within a smart irrigation system, underscoring the increasing
    need for robust security measures in the face of rising cyber threats. This strategic
    approach serves to fortify IoT security. However, the use of cryptographic algorithms
    adds overhead to the data packets, increasing their size. In resource-constrained
    IoT networks, this overhead can affect bandwidth utilization and data transmission
    efficiency. A hybrid encryption algorithm that combines ECC, RC4, and SHA-256
    was developed in [22]. This cryptographic fusion was devised to protect sensitive
    data within IoT-based irrigation systems, enhancing their overall security posture.
    However, ensuring compatibility between various IoT devices and platforms with
    different cryptographic algorithms can be challenging. Interoperability issues
    may arise if devices do not support the same encryption standards. [23] introduced
    a trustworthy and energy-efficient routing method for WSNs based on Fuzzy logic
    to determine the trustworthiness of various routes. This approach contributes
    to the reliability of data transmission. However, the performance and overhead
    in larger networks have not been adequately addressed. In the domain of mobile
    ad-hoc networks, [24] proposed a Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol aimed at
    quick identification of flooding attacks. This protocol not only identifies malicious
    actions but also imposes appropriate penalties and reevaluates the situation,
    adding a layer of security. However, the effectiveness of the protocol in handling
    a larger number of nodes and traffic loads are not evaluated. Moreover, the imposition
    of penalties and reevaluation of actions can introduce overhead that may affect
    network performance, especially in terms of latency. Harmony Search Algorithm
    (HSA) for the detection of faulty nodes was presented in [25]. Within this model,
    each memory vector in the HSA encompasses information regarding node energy and
    correlation between neighboring nodes’ data, facilitating the identification of
    problematic components within the network. Its performance with respect to different
    network settings and data traffic loads requires further investigation because
    implementing detection mechanisms that rely on memory vectors and correlation
    calculations can introduce additional computational overhead. In resource-constrained
    wireless networks, this extra overhead may impact the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption. Although several methods to identify sinkholes or other attacks in
    WSNs have been presented in the literature, the accuracy, rapidness and robustness
    of detection remain key issues. Given the shortcomings of current solutions, we
    propose TSMR-CDNN which offers advantages such as improved attack detection accuracy,
    precise legitimate node identification, minimal detection delay, utilization of
    multivariate data for comprehensive analysis, reduced temporal complexity, and
    a lower false positive rate. These features collectively contribute to enhanced
    network security and intrusion detection in the context of sinkhole attacks. 3
    Proposed TSMR-CDNN Model 3.1 Problem Formulation The WSN comprises an extensive
    number of low-powered and inexpensive sensor nodes. The basic characteristics
    of WSN make it subjected to numerous forms of attacks. Among the different types
    of attacks, the sinkhole attack is a type of attack in which the attacked node
    seeks to draw traffic from the network by delivering a fraudulent route update,
    which is then used to send false data to the head node. This is one of the adverse
    consequences of the sinkhole attack. Multiple nodes communicate with a single
    base station in an ad hoc network, hence the sinkhole only has to target the nodes
    near the head node rather than the network as a whole. For efficient detection
    of sinkhole attacks, we introduce a novel intrusion detection model called TSMR-CDNN.
    The different processes of the TSMR-CDNN model are discussed in the following
    sections. Fig. 1 Architecture of proposed TSMR-CDNN Full size image 3.2 System
    Model Reverse time synchronization scheme Time Synchronization in WSN is very
    important for basic communication because it provides the capability to detect
    movement, location, and proximity. In the time synchronization process, two parameters,
    i.e., (i) clock skew and (ii) offset represent the basic association between two
    hardware clocks. The accuracy in estimation is utilized for legitimate node detection
    based on the distinctiveness of hardware clocks. The reverse time synchronization
    scheme is employed for its ability to generate precise clock skews and offsets.
    The following definitions describe the clock skews between a sensor node’s hardware
    clock and the head node’s reference clock: $$\\begin{aligned} C_s=\\frac{C_H(S
    N)-\\omega _j}{t}-1 \\end{aligned}$$ (1) Therefore, $$\\begin{aligned} C_H(SN)=(1+C_s)t+\\omega
    _j \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where, \\( C_s \\) denotes the clock skews, C\\( _H \\)(SN)
    indicates the node’s hardware clock, t denotes the head node’s reference clock,
    \\( \\omega _j \\) indicates the offset between the two clocks. Received signal
    strength indicator (RSSI) A two-ray ground model is used to gauge the RSSI of
    the sensor node from the head node, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} R S S I=\\frac{G_{t^*}
    * G_r * h_t^2 * h_r^2}{D^4} * P_T \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\( G_t \\) and
    \\( G_r \\) represent the antenna gain of transmitter and receiver, \\( h_t\\)
    and \\( h_r\\) represent the height of transmitter and receiver antennas, the
    distance between the antenna of the transmitter and the receiver is denoted by
    D, and the transmitted signal power is denoted by \\(P_T\\). Link quality indicator
    (LQI) It is calculated by the head node to provide link quality information after
    the reception of every data packet. A greater LQI suggests a better connection
    quality and a lower rate of data loss, which are both connected to the reliable
    delivery of data packets. The LQI measurement is performed based on the packet
    reception ratio and RSSI value. $$\\begin{aligned} LQI=DP_{RR}\\times Norm(\\mu
    _{RSSI}) \\end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\\begin{aligned} Norm(\\mu _{RSSI})=\\frac{\\mu
    _{RSSI}}{60}+\\frac{100}{60} \\end{aligned}$$ (5) where, LQI denotes the Link
    quality indicator, DP\\( _{RR} \\) denotes the data packet reception ratio, \\(
    \\mu _{RSSI} \\) indicates the mean of RSSI, Norm denotes the normalization of
    \\( \\mu _{RSSI} \\). Energy of the sensor nodes (\\(E_{res}\\)): Energy is the
    other major parameter to enhance the network lifetime during the process of identifying
    attacks. Sinkhole attacks can result in energy holes in WSNs by draining the energy
    of neighboring nodes. \\( E_{res}\\) of a node is computed as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    E_{res}=T_E(SN)-Con_E(SN) \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(T_E(SN)\\) and \\(Con_E(SN)\\)
    denote the total and expended energy of the node, respectively. TSMR-CDNN Architecture
    diagram: The architecture diagram of the proposed TSMR-CDNN technique for attack
    detection and legitimate node identification for guaranteeing safe data transmission
    from source to head is presented in Fig. 1. The initial step involves providing
    the number of nodes to the input layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Subsequently,
    the input is passed to the convolutional layer, where a linear mathematical operation,
    known as convolution, is performed. First, each node in the network sends it information
    to the head of the WSN. In the max-pooling layer, the reverse time synchronization
    process is applied after the reception of node packets by the head node. Using
    this, the head node retrieves the clock features and radio information of each
    node. The radio information includes metrics like RSSI and LQI. Additionally,
    the energy levels of the nodes are estimated. After estimating these values, they
    are directed to the fully connected layer of the network. In this layer, Broken-stick
    regression is applied to analyze the multivariate data (clock features, RSSI,
    LQI, energy) by setting the threshold value. Then the Hardlimit activation function
    is applied to simultaneously perform legitimate node recognition and detection
    of sinkhole attacks, which effectively reduces the time complexity of attack detection.
    Finally, the output layer reveals highly accurate results for the classified nodes
    and detected sinkhole attacks. TSMR-CDNN and other contemporary methods are evaluated
    using several performance criteria. These metrics include attack identification
    accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, and time complexity. 3.3 TSMR-CDNN Algorithm
    Design The proposed deep neural network is a feed-forward model that generates
    the output classification results from a set of inputs. A number of layers, including
    an input, an output, and several hidden layers, constitute the proposed classifier.
    Each layer in the classifier contains individual units known as artificial neurons.
    These neurons are interconnected, with each neuron in one layer directly connected
    to neurons in the subsequent layer. The first layer, known as the input layer,
    receives the input, which in this case is the number of sensor nodes, SN= {\\(SN_1,
    SN_2, SN_3,\\ldots , SN_n\\)}, and one sink node SK deployed in the WSN. The last
    layer is the output layer. It has two units to provide the network outputs as
    sinkhole attacks and legitimate node identification. Between the input and output
    layers, there are two or more hidden layers. These hidden layers consist of a
    convolutional layer, a max-pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The computational
    process is performed in the hidden layers. TSMR-CDNN scheme is scalable for handling
    a large number of WSN nodes due to its architecture, which is designed to efficiently
    extract and process features from multivariate data more efficiently through the
    use of a Broken-stick regression approach. The proposed Convolution Deep Neural
    Network Model with multiple layers, including convolutional layers and pooling
    layers is capable of concurrent data processing. In the context of WSNs, each
    sensor node’s data can be treated as a separate input, and the model can process
    multiple inputs concurrently, allowing it to handle a large number of nodes without
    a significant increase in computation time. The use of the steepest gradient function
    for updating the weight parameters helps in minimizing the errors, making it more
    efficient and scalable. All these features make TSMR-CDNN a suitable choice for
    the efficient detection of sinkhole attacks in extensive WSN deployments. 3.3.1
    Input Layer The first layer is the input layer which receives the input. Initially,
    a number of sensor nodes, SN= {\\(SN_1\\), \\(SN_2\\), \\(SN_3\\),..., \\(SN_n\\)},
    and one sink node SK are passed as input to the input layer of the convolution
    deep neural network. 3.3.2 Convolution Layer After that, the input is fed into
    the convolution layer, which performs a linear mathematical operation that involves
    the product of a set of weights with the input sensor nodes. $$\\begin{aligned}
    X=\\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\sum _{j=1}^{m}(SN_i\\times \\theta _j)+B \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) where, X indicates the convolutional layer output, \\( \\theta _j \\) denotes
    the weight, \\(*\\) indicates a numerical operator called a convolution, B denotes
    the bias with value equal to 1. To start with, every node within the network sends
    the sensed data to the head node of the WSN. 3.3.3 Maxpooling Layer Within the
    max-pooling layer, as the sensed information from the sensor nodes reaches the
    head node, a process is initiated to retrieve the clock characteristics and radio
    details. To extract clock features, a reverse time synchronization mechanism is
    employed, allowing the head node to gauge the clock skews of the sensor nodes.
    Then the radio details of the sensor nodes such as the RSSI, LQI, and E\\( _{res}
    \\) are obtained using the Eqs. 3–6. The estimated values are supplied to the
    fully connected layer, which performs parameter analysis to identify the legitimate
    and attack nodes. 3.3.4 Fully Connected Layer In this layer, the Broken-stick
    Regression technique is employed to assess the estimated parameters. Broken-stick
    Regression is a machine learning strategy used to assess independent variables,
    which in this case are the sensor nodes. The analysis is based on multivariate
    data, including clock features, RSSI, LQI, and energy levels. By setting a threshold
    value, the technique helps to identify patterns and relationships within the data,
    enabling the classification of sensor nodes as either legitimate or potentially
    involved in a sinkhole attack. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} Y=(C_s>avg\\_C_s(SN_L)\\
    \\& \\& \\ (RSSI>T_{RSSI})\\ \\& \\& \\ \\\\ (LQI>T_{LQI})\\ \\& \\& \\ (E_{res}>T_{E_{res}}))
    \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (8) where Y denotes the output of the Broken-stick
    regression, \\(T_{RSSI}\\), \\(T_{LQI}\\), and \\(T_{E_{res}}\\) indicate the
    threshold of the RSSI, LQI and \\(E_{res}\\), respectively, and \\(avg\\_C_s(SN_L)
    \\) denotes the average clock skew value of the legitimate sensor node. The analyzed
    results are then passed to the Hardlimit activation function, which allows the
    output neuron to produce a result equal to 1 if the input attains a threshold;
    otherwise, it outputs a result equal to 0. $$\\begin{aligned} f={\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}
    1, &{} \\text {legitimate node} \\\\ 0, &{} \\text {illegitimate node (sinkhole
    attack)} \\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where f represents the outcomes
    of the Hardlimit activation function. When the value of f is 1, it signifies that
    the estimated parameter value exceeds the threshold. Otherwise, Hardlimit activation
    function returns 0. In this classification scenario, the output value of 1 denotes
    legitimacy, while the output value of 0 represents classification as a sinkhole
    attack node. With the classification results of normal and attack nodes, space
    complexity for accurate data storage and time is reduced. Error rate (ERR) textitestimation:
    After the classification process, the error rate is computed based on the actual
    and predicted results. $$\\begin{aligned} ERR=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum _{i=1}^{m}[(Act)-(Pred)]^2
    \\end{aligned}$$ (10) where m represents the number of observations. ERR is measured
    as the square of the difference between the actual (Act) and predicted (Pred)
    outcome of the activation function. To minimize the error, the node weight is
    updated with respect to the current error value. The steepest descent is applied
    for updating the weight of the sensor nodes. $$\\begin{aligned} \\theta _j(t+1)=
    \\theta _j(t)-L\\left[ \\frac{\\partial ERR}{\\partial \\theta _j} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\( \\theta _j(t+1) \\) is the new weight, \\( \\theta _j \\)(t) indicates
    the current weight, L denotes the learning rate, and \\( \\frac{\\partial ERR}{\\partial
    \\theta _j} \\) represents the first-order derivative to determine the function’s
    local minima (that is, error rate) by updating the current weight w. 3.3.5 Output
    Layer Ultimately, at the output layer, accurate data classification results are
    achieved by minimizing the error. Algorithm 1 Time Synchronized Multivariate Regressive
    Convolution Deep Neural Network Classification Full size image 3.3.6 Description
    of TSMR-CDNN Algorithm The pseudocode of TSMR-CDNN algorithm is provided in Algorithm
    1. The step-by-step procedure for achieving accurate normal node identification
    and attack detection while minimizing time consumption using TSMR-CDNN model is
    detailed as follows. The number of sensor nodes is given to the input layer [Steps
    1–2]. After that, the input is sent to the convolution layer, where the input
    is convolved with the set of weights and summed with bias [Steps 3–5]. Each node
    delivers the sensed data to the head [Step 6]. For each received data packet,
    the base station extracts the clock features, RSSI, LQI, and energy in the maxpooling
    layer [Steps 7–12]. The estimated results are sent to the fully connected layer,
    where the regression analysis is executed to classify the sensor nodes [Steps
    13–14]. Then the activation function is applied to classify the legitimate node
    or attack based on the regression analysis [Steps 16–20]. After that, the error
    is computed for each predicted output. In order to minimize the error, the steepest
    descent is employed for updating the weight values. This process is iterated until
    it reaches the minimum error [Steps 21–26]. Ultimately, accurate classification
    results are obtained at the output layer. 4 Simulation Analysis Here, we present
    the results of our simulations and conduct a comparative analysis of the TSMR-CDNN
    technique with existing NISA [1] and DNN [2] methods. The simulations were carried
    out using the NS2.34 simulator. A WSN area of dimension 1100 m \\(\\times \\)
    1100 m containing a count of 50–500 mobile nodes was considered in the simulation.
    Sinkhole nodes account for 15–20% of the total number of nodes in the network.
    The performance of the TSMR-CDNN in sinkhole attack recognition was analyzed using
    the AODV routing protocol. To study the impact of node mobility, the speed of
    the mobile nodes was varied from 0 to 20 m/s. The random waypoint mobility model
    was chosen for simulating the movement of the nodes. Table 1 provides the used
    parameters in simulation. Table 1 Simulation parameters Full size table Next,
    we discuss the performance analysis of TSMR-CDNN and existing NISA [1], and DNN
    [2] methods with respect to different parameters that include (1) Attack detection
    accuracy, (2) Precision, (3) Recall, (4) F-measure, and (5) Attack detection time,
    as follows: 4.1 Attack Detection Accuracy Results Accuracy (ADA) is calculated
    by taking the ratio of the number of nodes that are correctly classified as either
    legitimate or attacked to the total number of nodes present in the network (Table
    2). ADA is measured in percentage (%), and is determined as below: $$\\begin{aligned}
    ADA=\\frac{TRP+TRN}{TRP+FLP+TRN+FLN}\\times 100 \\end{aligned}$$ (12) where, TRP
    denotes true positives, TRN indicates true negatives, FLP represents false positives,
    FLN denotes false negatives. Table 2 Comparison of attack detection accuracy Full
    size table Fig. 2 Attack detection accuracy results Full size image Figure 2 demonstrates
    the performance analysis of attack detection accuracy with respect to varying
    number of nodes in WSN. The attack detection accuracy is measured for the three
    methods, TSMR-CDNN and existing NISA [1] and DNN [2]. Among the three methods,
    the proposed TSMR-CDNN achieved higher attack detection accuracy than the other
    methods. Let’s consider a network scenario where we have a total of 50 nodes.
    By applying TSMR-CDNN, the accuracy was observed to be 94% and the accuracy of
    existing NISA and DNN were 86% and 90%, respectively. Similarly, different performance
    outcomes are obtained for all approaches when the number of nodes is varied. According
    to the average of 10 results, the attack detection accuracy was increased by 6%
    and 4% when compared to NISA and DNN, respectively. This is because the proposed
    TSMR-CDNN technique uses Broken-stick regression for analyzing the clock characteristics
    and radio details such as the RSSI, LQI, and energy of nodes by means of threshold
    values. The Hardlimit activation function is applied to simultaneously perform
    legitimate sensor node identification and sinkhole attack detection. This resulted
    in better performance of TSMR-CDNN. 4.2 Precision Results Precision is determined
    in terms of the true positives and false positives in the legitimate or attack
    node classification, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} PRE=\\frac{TRP}{TRP+FLP} \\times
    100 \\end{aligned}$$ (13) where PRE is the precision, which is expressed as percentage
    (%). TRP denotes true positives, and FLP indicates false positives, respectively
    (Table 3). Table 3 Comparison of precision Full size table Fig. 3 Precision results
    Full size image Figure 3 depicts the simulation results in terms of precision
    with respect to the three different methods, namely TSMR-CDNN, NISA and DNN. The
    performance outcomes for precision are higher using TSMR-CDNN technique than the
    existing methods. With simulation conducted using 50 sensor nodes, the precision
    was observed to be 95.45% for TSMR-CDNN, and 89.74% and 92.85% using NISA and
    DNN, respectively. Improved result for TSMR-CDNN indicates that all the sensor
    nodes are accurately classified to obtain higher true positive results and lesser
    false negative results. Finally, after averaging the results from ten experiments,
    it was observed that the precision performance of TSMR-CDNN showed a significant
    improvement of 4% than the NISA method and 2% than the DNN method. These findings
    suggest that the TSMR-CDNN approach is more effective in accurately identifying
    and classifying nodes, resulting in a higher precision rate when compared to the
    existing NISA and DNN. With this method, the true positive rate is enhanced by
    applying a convolutional deep neural network classifier for analyzing the clock
    features and radio information by applying the regression function. The use of
    the steepest descent algorithm minimized the last square error and resulted in
    a reduction of the false positive rate. 4.3 Recall Results Recall is determined
    in terms of true positives and false negatives in the legitimate or attack node
    classification, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} REL=\\frac{TRP}{TRP+FLN}\\times
    100 \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, REL denotes the recall (expressed in percentage
    (%)). TRP denotes true positives, and FLN indicates false negatives (Table 4).
    Table 4 Comparison of recall Full size table Fig. 4 Recall results Full size image
    Figure 4 demonstrates the performance results of recall under varying number of
    sensor nodes. The performance in the recall rate is found to be relatively higher
    using the TSMR-CDNN technique upon comparison with NISA and DNN. This is proved
    through the statistical assessment. For the initial simulation, we consider a
    network setup consisting of 50 sensor nodes. The performance of recall was observed
    to be 97.67%, 92.10%, and 95.10% by applying TSMR-CDNN, NISA, and DNN, respectively.
    According to the comparative results, the recall results of TSMR-CDNN is enhanced
    by 3% and 2% than NISA and DNN, respectively. This is because TSMR-CDNN uses Hardlimit
    activation function to classify the normal or attacks; and accurately provides
    the labels, which improves the true positives and reduces the true negative results.
    4.4 F-Measure Results By taking the average of precision (PRE) and recall (REL),
    the F-measure provides a comprehensive evaluation of the system’s ability to classify
    and identify nodes accurately (Table 5). It is expressed in % and is calculated
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} F-ME=\\left[ 2 \\times \\frac{PRE \\times REL}{PRE+
    REL} \\right] \\times 100 \\end{aligned}$$ (15) Table 5 Comparison of F-measure
    Full size table Fig. 5 F-measure results Full size image Figure 5 reveals the
    F-measure results under different number of sensor nodes. F-measure is calculated
    according to the precision and recall performance during the classification process.
    From the observed simulation results, F-measure was found to be 96.54% using the
    TSMR-CDNN technique, 90.90% using NISA, and 93.97% using DNN. From the result,
    it is evident that the F-measure performance of TSMR-CDNN is considerably improved
    than the other compared methods. By applying TSMR-CDNN technique, the performance
    in terms of precision as well as recall is significantly improved during the node
    classification process. This improved the F-measure results using the TSMR-CDNN
    technique. The overall performance results indicate that the F-measure using TSMR-CDNN
    technique is considerably improved by 4% than NISA and 2% than DNN, respectively
    (Table 6). $$\\begin{aligned} ADT=\\sum _{i=1}^{n}SN_i \\times T(CSN) \\end{aligned}$$
    (16) Fig. 6 Attack detection time results Full size image Table 6 Comparison of
    ADT results Full size table 4.5 Attack Detection Time Results The overall attack
    detection time (ADT) refers to the time taken by the algorithm to predict the
    classification results for legitimate and attack nodes. It is an important metric
    to assess the efficiency and speed of the algorithm in detecting attacks. It is
    computed based on the number of sensor nodes (n) and the time (in milliseconds)
    it takes to classify each sensor node (T(CSN)). The formula is as follows: Figure
    6 reveals the graphical depiction of sinkhole attack detection time using the
    three methods, TSMR-CDNN, NISA, and DNN, respectively. From the figure, we can
    infer that there is a positive correlation between the number of nodes and the
    time consumption for node classification. As the number of nodes increases, the
    time required for classifying each node also increases. During the simulation
    with 50 sensor nodes, the TSMR-CDNN algorithm demonstrated an attack detection
    time of 17.5 ms. On the other hand, the NISA algorithm took approximately 22 ms
    for overall attack detection, while the DNN algorithm took around 20 ms. It is
    revealed from the results that the sinkhole attack detection time using TSMR-CDNN
    was reduced by 13% and 7% when compared to NISA and DNN, respectively. The improvement
    is due to the measurement of the clock characteristics and radio details of the
    nodes. The features extracted from the nodes are subjected to a regression process
    to analyze and accurately classify the nodes as either legitimate or sinkhole
    attack nodes. This helps to minimize the attack detection time. 5 Conclusion The
    paper introduces a novel intrusion detection model named TSMR-CDNN for the identification
    of legitimate nodes and the detection of sinkhole attacks in WSNs. The model utilizes
    clock characteristics and radio details to effectively differentiate between legitimate
    nodes and nodes involved in sinkhole attacks. Upon receiving data packets from
    the nodes, the clock features and radio information of each node are estimated
    within the maxpooling layer. These estimated features are then analyzed using
    the regression function and a threshold value to determine if a node is legitimate
    or part of a sinkhole attack. The activation function classifies the node based
    on minimal error. To evaluate the performance of TSMR-CDNN, a comprehensive simulation
    assessment is conducted, considering different number of sensor nodes. The statistical
    analysis of the results confirms that TSMR-CDNN outperforms the existing methods
    in terms of attack detection accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, and detection
    time. The results reveal that TSMR-CDNN exceeds the existing methods with a 5%
    improvement in attack detection accuracy, a 3% enhancement in recall, precision,
    and F-measure, and a 10% reduction in attack detection time, respectively. The
    proposed model demonstrates higher accuracy and efficiency in identifying normal
    nodes and detecting sinkhole attacks, making it a promising solution for intrusion
    detection in WSNs. In the future, our focus will be on further minimizing attack
    detection time by improving data classification. Our future efforts will also
    extend to addressing data classification challenges with reduced complexity at
    the early stages of development. Data availability: N/A References Huan, X., Kyeong,

  description: Concerns relating to safety and privacy have been brought to light
    as a result of the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such
    as smart home appliances, mobile phones, and smart watches. Security has emerged
    as an essential component in the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems
    in light of the growing number of assaults that originate from both malicious
    and non-malicious sources. The increasing volume of data that is stored in IoT
    systems presents a number of unique challenges, one of the most crucial being
    data security. Hackers may be able to remotely take control of Internet of Things
    devices if inadequate security measures are in place, which may result in substantial
    harm. This research suggests utilizing the Aggressive Cuckoo Search Algorithm
    method (ACS), the SHA-256 method, and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in
    order to solve these issues while enhancing the safety of internet of things (I
    smart door lock systems. ACS stands for Aggressive Cuckoo Search, SHA-256 stands
    for Secure Hash Algorithm, and ECC stands for Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In
    order to produce the ECC private key, the suggested architecture makes use of
    ACS, which has the potential to improve the data storage security of IoT systems.
    In the study, both the encoding and decoding times of the suggested design are
    analyzed, and it is compared to other encoding methods like (ECC-GA-SHA-256) and
    (ECC-FA-SHA-256). The findings indicate that the proposed design is capable of
    producing superior outcomes with 125 iterations for the encoding process and 175
    iterations for the decoding process. In addition, the proposed design features
    encoding and decoding times that are over 16.17 percentage points faster than
    those of previous encoding methods. Based on these data, it appears that the design
    that was proposed has the potential to considerably improve the functionality
    and safety of IoT-based smart door lock systems. The employment of ACS, SHA-256,
    and ECC can serve as potential solutions to overcome the security concerns connected
    with IoT-based intelligent locking systems. These are all cryptographic standard
    algorithms.

    1 INTRODUCTION Digital services and products'' core values and possibilities are
    amplified, creating exponentially growing potential in the digital transformation
    era. Humans and autonomous devices may cooperate beyond their physical vicinity
    using digital technology–decision-making benefits from increased sharing and access
    to enterprise knowledge-base. In addition, a surge of digital services, processes,
    economy, and goods push knowledge-based decision-making for digital Enterprise
    Architectures (EA) and Expert Systems (ES), including consumer devices, social
    networks, and intelligent transportation (Moulahi et al. (2023), Deepa and Prabadevi
    (2020)). A plethora of physical devices are interconnected in current enterprise
    architectures through wireless Internet data transfer providing a global communications
    environment. Enterprise systems are becoming more significant and sophisticated
    as the Internet of Things (IoT) and other new sustainable technologies hit the
    market (Zimmermann et al. (2018), Arshad et al. (2022)). Artificial intelligence,
    sophisticated analytics, and Machine Learning (ML) are all supported by an IoT-based
    platform solution. As EA evolve and become more sustainable, decision analytics
    will become an increasingly important decision support tool Ebo et al. (2020)).
    Using these expert systems and methods, software and system architecture managers
    and engineers may become part of a sustainable company, including robust and constantly
    growing service-oriented architectures and platforms that empower and promote
    new or significantly improved strategies Anwar (2023). With the help of other
    technologies such as sensors, embedded systems, big data analytics, and ML, IoT
    can make any activity smarter by making it easier to collect, analyze, and distribute
    massive data Khanna et al. (2023). IoT can automate learning and prediction processes
    (of machines) through experiences. Enterprise IoT is an IoT variation that has
    had the most influence on business (Liu, Feng, et al. (2020), Moqurrab et al.
    (2022b)). Various front- and back-office operations are associated with an enterprise.
    Using IoT and business, an organization''s actions may be automated, as smart
    devices can be embedded in enterprise things and connect, allowing organizations
    to complete systems and processes with or without direct human intervention. By
    doing so, an enterprise will see increased productivity and a decrease in the
    number of manual processes. Therefore, IoT became a modern network model offering
    transparent and open services (Schreieck et al. (2016), Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat
    (2019)). Many intelligent devices, such as cell phones, sensors, and other intelligent
    devices, are linked via IoT. These intelligent devices can interact and share
    information between them. Thus, sophisticated structures may be built to improve
    people''s lives by gathering and reviewing data on these IoT devices to understand
    the environment better. Examples may include human body movements, machine condition
    diagnostics, health tracking, position, and systemic monitoring. As IoT is widely
    used and becomes standard, huge sensors and devices produce massive data (Huang
    et al. (2016), Hassan et al. (2023), Abbas et al. (2019)). Numerous IoT applications
    are built to provide users with more detailed and fine-grained services in EA
    (Ilin et al. (2019), Sharma & Wang et al. (2017). The massive data in IoT may
    be analyzed and processed further to provide Integrated services to the providers
    and consumers. New IoT applications include various data-based processing approaches
    in the EA domain to effectively use broad IoT sensing data (Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat
    (2019), Masuda et al. (2021)). Within the last decade, ML has become a huge hit
    with advancements in the graphics processing unit, cloud computing, and other
    hardware advances in technology to support EA (Klaine et al. (2017)). Figure 1
    presents an overview of ML significance and role in IoT-based EA. The most paradigmatic
    algorithms in ML have been used in many areas, including decision-making (Zhao
    et al. (2020), Seyedzadeh et al. (2020), Valdivia et al. (2021)) and intelligent
    control (Matei et al. (2021), Yuan et al. (2020), Tofighbakhsh (2020)), computer
    graphics (Zoni (2020), Janai et al. (2020), Arya et al. (2020)), voice recognition
    (Honnavalli and Shylaja (2021), Kuśmierczyk et al. (2020), Shankar et al. (2020)),
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Moon et al. (2021), Van Rousselt (2021), Prudhvi
    et al. (2021)), and computer vision (Tien et al. (2021), Willman (2021), Falk
    et al. (2020)). Likewise, ML will also give computer networks a potential advantage.
    Some researchers investigated how ML can deal with networking issues such as traffic
    engineering (Verma (2021), Rezaei and Liu (2020), Shafiq et al. (2020)), routing
    (Hussain et al. (2021), Refonaa and Lakshmi (2021), Mandal et al. (2021)), allocation
    of resources (Liu, Yu, et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (2020), Pesavento and Bahlke
    (2020)), and security (Montasari et al. (2021), Francia and El-Sheikh (2021),
    Khan et al. (2021)). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The role of ML
    in IoT-based enterprise architectures. This survey aims to highlight the significance
    of ML algorithms concerning IoT applications, such as smart homes, smart healthcare,
    smart cities, smart grids, and smart agriculture. To the best of our knowledge,
    no state-of-the-art survey covers all these applications under one umbrella. As
    shown in Table 1, existing surveys mainly focus on a single application, such
    as security (Patnaik et al. (2021), Al-Garadi et al. (2020), Chaabouni et al.
    (2019), Xiao et al. (2018), da Costa et al. (2019)), healthcare (Dhillon and Singh
    (2019), Manogaran and Lopez (2017), Ray (2021), Amulya et al. (2021)), smart homes
    (Ramasamy Ramamurthy and Roy (2018), Ali et al. (2019), Bakar et al. (2016)),
    smart cities (Chen et al. (2019), Mohapatra and Panda (2019), Ullah et al. (2020),
    Luckey et al. (2021)), smart grids (Arif et al. (2020), Babar et al. (2020), Hasan
    et al. (2020), Narayanan et al. (2023)), and smart agriculture (Pathan et al.
    (2020), Sharma et al. (2020), Escamilla-García et al. (2020)). In contrast, this
    study analyzes ML technology, focusing exclusively on its solutions, challenges,
    and open issues in the mentioned domains. A nomenclature summary is presented
    in Table 2 that provides accurate descriptions of all acronyms used in this survey.
    The following are the goals of this survey: Investigate the relationship between
    IoT and ML in the context of enterprise architectures. Explain how ML methods
    might improve IoT-based enterprise systems. To assess and compile the most recent
    studies on ML and IoT in enterprise architectures. Determine the benefits, drawbacks,
    and prospects of ML and IoT integration in enterprise systems. Draw attention
    to the scenarios and use cases where ML may improve the adaptability, functionality,
    and automation of IoT-based services in enterprises. Provide knowledge and direction
    to researchers, professionals, and decision-makers interested in using ML to enhance
    IoT-based systems in the enterprise domain. TABLE 1. Comparison among existing

    and ML integration. A thorough discussion, key findings, and future recommendations
    are provided in Section 20, and finally, the conclusion is given in Section 21.
    2 ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF IOT AND ML Leveraging the promise
    of IoT and ML technologies within enterprises requires a strong enterprise architecture.
    A strong EA offers a well-organized framework for developing, implementing, and
    overseeing intricate systems that include IoT gadgets and ML algorithms. This
    section details the importance of business architecture in the context of IoT-based
    systems and examines its essential elements and factors. 2.1 Significance of enterprise
    architecture The plan of action for coordinating company goals with technological
    capabilities is called enterprise architecture (Möhring et al. (2023), Gaurav
    et al. (2023)). EA provides enterprises with various advantages in the field of
    IoT and ML, including: Integration and Interoperability: The seamless integration
    of numerous IoT devices, sensors, and ML algorithms across diverse business units
    is made possible by enterprise architecture. It guarantees data flow and compatibility
    between various systems, enabling a comprehensive understanding of organizational
    processes (Ali et al. (2020)). Scalability and Flexibility: Enterprise architecture
    offers a flexible and scalable infrastructure, given the fast use of IoT devices
    and developing ML approaches. It enables businesses to adjust to shifting technological
    environments, handle growing data quantities, and adopt new ML algorithms as they
    become available (Tariq, Khan, and Asim (2021)). Efficiency and Optimization:
    Enterprise architectural concepts can help firms maximize their efforts in IoT
    and ML. It makes it possible to find duplicates, eliminate silos, and streamline
    procedures, improving operational effectiveness and lowering costs (Escamilla-García
    et al. (2020)). Security and Privacy: In IoT and ML deployments, enterprise architecture
    frameworks give security and privacy a top priority (Farooq et al. (2022), Moqurrab
    et al. (2021)). It provides strong security measures, data governance regulations,
    and compliance standards to safeguard private data and reduce dangers related
    to connected devices and ML algorithms (Moqurrab et al. (2022b)). 2.2 Key components
    of enterprise architecture Enterprise architecture includes several crucial elements
    that must be present to integrate IoT and ML technologies successfully: Business
    architecture: Company''s strategic objectives, operational procedures, and functional
    requirements are outlined in this component (Sari and Hindarto (2023)). It pinpoints
    the applications where IoT and ML can add considerable value and harmonizes technological
    ambitions with corporate goals. Data architecture: IoT and ML systems are built
    around data. The gathering, storing, integrating, and analytics of data are the
    main topics of the data architecture component. Addressing data quality issues,
    interoperability, and real-time processing provides ML algorithms with a solid
    foundation (Möhring et al. (2023)). Technology architecture: Technology architecture
    includes networking, hardware, and software to support IoT and ML applications
    (Jnr and Petersen (2023)). Building a strong technical environment considers connectivity,
    scalability, and device management. Application architecture: The creation and
    implementation of IoT and ML applications are the focus of this component. It
    outlines the architectural patterns, user interfaces, and integration techniques
    required to create smart applications that use ML techniques and communicate with
    IoT devices (Jnr and Petersen (2023)). Security architecture: Security architecture
    is essential because of the sensitivity of IoT data and the possible threats connected
    with ML algorithms. To safeguard enterprise systems and defend against cyber threats,
    it establishes security frameworks, authentication procedures, encryption standards,
    and intrusion detection systems (Bhatia et al. (2023)). 2.3 Considerations in
    enterprise architecture design Considerations for designing an efficient enterprise
    architecture for IoT and ML include the following: Interoperability and standards:
    The wide variety of IoT devices and ML algorithms makes it essential to ensure
    interoperability and adherence to standards. To provide seamless communication
    and data sharing between systems, enterprise architects must assess protocols,
    data formats, and integration frameworks (Mekala et al. (2023)). Scalability and
    performance: Enterprise architectures must grow due to the large volumes of data
    produced by IoT installations and ML algorithms. Architects should consider distributed
    computing, cloud-based options, and effective data processing strategies to achieve
    optimum performance (Farooq et al. (2022)). Data governance and ethics: Effective
    data governance processes are crucial to preserving data integrity, privacy, and
    ethical use of IoT-generated data (Samuel et al. (2023)). Enterprise architectures
    should include rules, methods, and standards for handling data, managing consent,
    and adhering to legal obligations. Integration with existing systems: Organizations
    often have established IT infrastructure and legacy systems. To minimize disruptions
    and maximize prior investments, enterprise architects must develop solutions that
    smoothly integrate IoT and ML technologies with current systems (Farooq et al.
    (2022)). Continuous adaptation and evolution: Landscapes in IoT and ML are changing
    quickly. For enterprise designs to stay up with new technologies, market trends,
    and shifting business needs, they must adopt a constant adaptation and development
    culture (Samuel et al. (2023)). The foundation for effective IoT and ML integration
    in enterprises is enterprise architecture. EA offers a methodical way to handle
    problems with integration, scalability, effectiveness, and security. Enterprise
    architects can build solid architectures that enable the realization of IoT-based
    solutions within the enterprise domain by considering important factors and design
    considerations. 3 ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS ML has had
    a profound impact on the way organizations approach business (Moh''d et al. (2020)).
    ML is a cutting-edge tool that distinguishes itself from numerous other approaches
    to hands-free operating. ML methods have made it feasible for engineers not to
    need explicit models to study certain aspects of an issue. There is no need for
    human intervention since the machines do it for themselves (Zdravković et al.
    (2021)). ML has forced firms to rethink their decision-making processes in light
    of these new capabilities. ML uses past data as an example to make predictions
    from new information. One could establish a customer lifetime value on an e-Commerce
    merchant computer website for a forthcoming client meeting. It is possible to
    utilize ML if companies possess previous data on client interactions and net profits
    associated with purchasers (Kalita et al. (2021)). ML and IoT are causing a worldwide
    shift in the enterprise domain. Since information and data are massively generated,
    incorporating IoT information optimization concepts and methods has become inevitable.
    ML approaches reduce the amount of human effort required by learning. As a stand-alone
    device, ML identifies data patterns and makes independent decisions. Whenever
    a sensor collects data, someone on the backend must identify, analyze, and feed
    the information to the unit for decision-making, which ML can solve (Ali et al.
    (2020)). Now the question is, how precisely can an analyst deal with data flow
    when it is massive? Driverless cars, for example, must make quick decisions without
    relying on humans. That is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in handy (Anyanwu
    (2021)). To determine the algorithm for a particular set of tasks, one must first
    determine what the work entails. Discovering unusual features, detecting systems,
    forecasting values and groupings, and extracting functions are only a few of the
    included tasks (Zdravković et al. (2021)). It is considerably more straightforward
    for a newcomer to identify the correct algorithm if the datasets for different
    tasks are categorized. Clustering methods like K-means may concentrate on information
    system discoveries (Nair et al. (2020)). K-means was designed to cope with large
    amounts of data that include various forms of information. One-class support vector
    machines (SVM) and anomaly detection algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA) are appropriate for factors extracted through rare features (Jin et al.
    (2020)), this is just another example. ML and IoT are like playing buzzword bingo
    when analyzing specific use cases. This combination of ideas makes perfect sense,
    however. IoT is expected to generate more than 180 zettabytes of data by 2025
    (i.e., 180 trillion gigabytes/annum) (Liu, Mu, et al. (2021)), and ML is good
    at analyzing large datasets. ML is a science field that helps computers learn
    instead of being programmed exclusively (Shanthamallu et al. (2017)). A computer
    program is said to learn about a job T and a metric of success P from an E experience
    (Mitchell (1997)). While ML originated in computer science, numerous methods of
    vector quantification (Zou et al. (2021)) have been introduced for telecommunications
    and data transmission (Li & Yuan et al. (2020)), encoding and compression (Liu,
    Yao, and Du (2021), Spanias et al. (2006)). In computer science and data science,
    learning is focused on examples (data samples) and practice. Figure 2 illustrates
    an abstract view of an ML model of a sensor signal/data processing (Shanthamallu
    et al. (2017), Kovvali et al. (2013), Foutz et al. (2008), Spanias (2007)), including
    pre-processing, removal of noise, and segmentation. The signal is obtained and
    analyzed from the sensor in batches and frame-wise (Wichern et al. (2010)). The
    next step is the elimination of noise and the extraction of features. Lastly,
    the classification point will involve either an estimate or a judgment after the
    course. In the feature extraction process, features are usually extracted from
    the data. The set of classification features will need to be identified (Shanthamallu
    et al. (2017)). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint An abstract view of
    the ML model. ML is essential in various areas with many substantial life-changing
    applications. Cloud computing makes it easier for ML to grow Sarangi et al. (2021).
    The importance of compressing and collecting data from sensors and extensive data
    has recently been at its peak (Tariq, Asim, et al. (2021), Tariq et al. (2020)).
    Innovative urban initiatives, smart healthcare management, connected defence,
    production, smart vehicles, supervision, and smart border enforcement have peculiarities
    and difficulties that make it challenging to produce optimum performance (Tariq,
    Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019), Ali et al. (2023)). Statistical computing and data
    analysis are essential for transmitting and interpreting data and data analysis
    (Dumuid et al. (2020), Vives-Mestres and Casanova (2021)). ML algorithms have
    been widely categorized into three categories depending on the features, the form
    of learning, and the way data can be used (Chatterjee et al. (2021), Farooq et
    al. (2022)). Each category has its unique characteristics. Therefore, it is crucial
    to identify and simplify the functions of knowledge and learning models for IoT
    applications. There are four different forms of ML: supervised, unsupervised,
    semi-supervised, and augmented learning (Chen et al. (2020), Dhanaraj et al. (2020)).
    There are several variations between guided learning and unsupervised learning.
    By using prior information, a more reliable inference can be obtained. A supervised
    function is developed to approximate. Furthermore, taking into account relationships
    between variables, different versions of ML can be used. We have only input variables
    in unsupervised instruction (i.e., the labelled data). Unsupervised learning aims
    to infer natural structure from a set of given observations. It is used to create
    models of underlying data structure. Supervised learning can only function where
    sufficient labelled training data is available. Unsupervised classes have no “right”
    or “wrong” labels–semi-supervised learning attempts to solve this challenge by
    combining supervised and unsupervised learning elements. There is multiple input
    data; however, only a handful are given a name. To fully grasp why IoT needs ML,
    subsequent Sections provide an in-depth analysis of different IoT applications,
    the role of ML in each application, and the Challenges, Open Issues, and Research
    Directions. In a nutshell, the satisfaction of customers, improved enterprise
    efficiency by assuring the safety of equipment, and improved accuracy are some
    of the fantastic ML benefits of IoT-enabled EA, including reducing lost income
    due to downtime, allowing for proper record keeping, predicting equipment failure
    before it happens, and delivering real-time data. 3.1 Challenges of ML in IoT
    IoT aims to gain insight into preferences and thought processes, foresee desirable
    and undesirable outcomes, and better handle previously uncontrollable circumstances.
    It depends on the data generated by millions of connected IoT devices to be analyzed
    efficiently and correctly by ML algorithms. Since IoT applications are ubiquitous,
    ML will be crucial in sifting through the massive amounts of data generated. In
    addition, embedded intelligence (EI) will serve as its backbone in realizing IoT
    applications'' goals. To improve efficiency, automation, performance, and connection,
    EI is the combination of intelligence and products (Sharma, Georgi, et al. (2022)).
    Contrary to the common belief, additional training data helps improve learning
    instead of just improving and building new ML algorithms Farooq et al. (2022).
    In IoT applications, dealing with big data is challenging. There will be a tsunami
    of information due to the billions of IoT devices linked to the Internet. Accordingly,
    IoT-based ML algorithms learn from the massive quantity of data. From an IoT angle,
    ML applications may be viewed keeping two key concerns: pattern recognition and
    data quality. ML improves learning by predicting from more accurate data and may
    also be used to improve data quality. However, before training ML-based algorithms
    for prediction, they may detect anomalies and fill in missing information. ML
    makes IoT smart and omnipresent. IoT is sometimes a synonym for “heterogeneous”
    since it encompasses many things: devices, network technologies, protocols, diverse
    data, applications, and users. Given the diversity of IoT devices, ML faces several
    challenges, as mentioned below: IoT generates massive amounts of data (Tariq,
    Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019)). However, not all this data is reliable, and some
    may even be skewed. These are the most critical factors influencing ML''s precision,
    effectiveness, and robustness in IoT. Not all IoT applications have access to
    large amounts of data from which ML may learn rapidly; yet, a large amount of
    little data are also created for these algorithms required to learn from scant
    data (Mohapatra and Panda (2019)). There is no guarantee that a sensing device
    will provide correct results (Arya et al. (2020)). Preparing data for ML includes
    processes like outlier identification and data imputation. The scope of possible
    IoT applications is vast. Every program has information that has its own set of
    characteristics. Although ML performs better than humans, data can be enormous
    and heterogeneous. Fine-tuning of data and ML algorithms is needed (Samuel et
    al. (2023)). Few academics, however, argue to the contrary. The question is, which
    is preferable? More complex ML algorithms to learn and predict better, larger
    data sets for deep learning models, or fewer data sets of higher quality? Despite
    the many studies devoted to the topic, ML experts cannot agree on a solution to
    this fundamental issue. Disruptive technologies like IoT provide a wealth of benefits
    for organizations and a great deal of danger; ML-enabled IoT can potentially eliminate
    millions of jobs (Nayak et al. (2022)). This reduction in the workforce can be
    detrimental to both the economy and society itself. 4 MACHINE LEARNING AND INTERNET
    OF THINGS A specific physical entity that can communicate through the Internet
    with some storage space and processing power for data collection purposes is termed
    a “thing” and makes up as a collection the term IoT. Small actuators, cell phones,
    devices, sensors, almost anything could be “things.” Objects, intricate devices
    like cell phones, and even necessities like food, works of art, furnishings, and
    buildings, to cite a few, are considered objects. IoT includes applications ranging
    from home automation to operating areas, including logistics, transport, medical
    facilities, defense, intelligence, and many more (Tariq, Khan, and Asim (2021)).
    This section details ML-based solutions in different IoT applications, challenges,
    open issues, and future research trends. 4.1 Smart agriculture Technology has
    played a crucial role in easing people''s everyday lives, while negative aspects
    should be tackled for their progress. The intelligent environmental systems aid
    in environmental management and monitoring (Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019)).
    Wind pollution has been a severe challenge all over the world. Intelligent environmental
    systems use sensors to track moisture, and heat, as illustrated in Figure 3. Farmers
    use intelligent farming systems to achieve higher crop yields with improved productivity.
    The adequate environment metrics for agriculture are collected via sensors and
    sent to servers for soil information, such as temperature, moisture, and control
    of pesticides. Such data are recorded to empower farmers about the soil quality
    and suitability for cultivation. Smart agriculture often contributes to the quality
    of crop production (Ahmed and Yadav (2023)). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Smart agriculture. Agriculture automation is of much concern in every region.
    The world''s population is rising very quickly, and the demand for food rises
    dramatically with an increased population. More useful technology is needed above
    standard farmer strategies to satisfy the rising demand. Farmers must also hamper
    the soil by increasing the use of toxic pesticides. Pesticides has many impacts
    on cultivation; eventually, the soil remains infertile. Several researchers have
    proposed different solutions, such as a fuzzy logic-based framework PRITHVI (Prakash
    et al. (2013)). It was designed to grow soybeans. It came from agricultural agents,
    journals, and substantial knowledge of soybean crops. Fuzzy logic significantly
    influences researching the entire scheme and asking the farmer for guidance. The
    original intent of this scheme was to allow the farmers to improve their soybean
    yield. Another approach (Ravichandran and Koteeshwari (2016)) is to use Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) for crop prediction for mobile users. A mathematical projection
    model was used in this research. This framework''s predictive has three main components.
    The model''s precision is based on the hidden layers‘ number. It developed and
    trained the ANN model with the aid of numerous algorithms. For example, it includes
    Rprop, Silva''s algorithm, Delta-bar-delta, and numerous others methodologies
    to find an appropriate configuration. A new approach was made to determine weeds
    from crops with image processing and neural networks in (Shahzadi et al. (2016)).
    In this way, it has a high degree of success rate of precision. This method forwards
    data to a server for changing field operations on the data. The server should
    be able to learn from its mistakes and make choices independently. This mechanism
    includes temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and light. The approach
    offers information about the area in question but does not detail a specific method.
    Patil and Thorat (2016) developed mechanisms that foresee the advent of grape
    disease. Any trace of an odd grape plant was caught before it extended to the
    rest of the grape vineyard. The machine employed numerous sensors, such as humidity,
    temperature, and moisture sensors in the vineyard to monitor and analyze crop
    conditions. IoT is needed to increase efficiency, competitiveness, and global
    market share and reduce labor costs. In Yahata et al. (2017), the authors automate
    plant phenotyping using hybrid ML technologies. Similarly, (Magomadov (2019),
    Reddy et al. (2020), and Salim and Mitton (2021)) used Deep Learning and ML-based
    solutions to augment smart agriculture. To increase productivity, IoT and agriculture
    work together for smart farming. Malavade and Akulwar (2016) analyzed how IoT
    could be used to develop agricultural systems. The different methods of using
    wireless sensor networks in the agriculture sector are described in this article.
    Many IEEE standards, including IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.1, ZigBee, and Personal
    Area Networks/Bluetooth (to mention a few), are required to use a sensor network
    successfully (Khan et al. (2020)). The authors addressed IPV6 for IP wireless
    connectivity and different hardware system for developing WSN (Abbas et al. (2019)).
    The technique used for crop management makes precise farming possible through
    WSN. Various data is captured and stored in the device by sensors. Using previous
    data from sensors, the device is trained, and future steps are initiated (Shiravale
    and Bhagat (2014)). In Gondchawar and Kawitkar (2016), remote operations are included
    as a smart robot (i.e., GPS-based) to carry out chores such as weaving, squirting,
    detecting humidity, scaring off birds or livestock, and vigilance. Secondly, smart
    irrigation uses smart power based on real-time field data. Thirdly, the intelligent
    operation of warehouses includes maintaining temperature, humidity, and warehouse
    theft detection. All Internet-connected remote smart devices or computers can
    manage these distinct operations. Furthermore, sensors, Wi-Fi or Zig-Bee modulus,
    micro-controller, and Raspberry Pi cameras and actuators are handled by automation.
    Thermal imaging gives farmers valuable data about the surface and temperature
    of their fields to help them make timely decisions. In the context of cloud-based
    thermal imaging, Roopaei et al. (2017) explored the use of the system to support
    irrigation by integrating equipment efficiency and identifying the areas where
    water is most needed. Failure to achieve consistency could hamper crop growth
    and help consolidate thermal imaging. Besides, thermal imaging has a wide application
    in agriculture. The use of robots in agriculture is discussed in Katariya et al.
    (2015). A robot is built to monitor the white track where their operation is required,
    and other surfaces are known as brown or black. The robot is used to spray pesticides,
    pour crops, supply water, and plow. Another knowledge-based monitoring module
    was developed by a group of researchers in Mohanraj et al. (2016). The authors
    discussed that IoT and cloud computing systems emphasize stable architecture for
    interactive information provision over 3G and Wi-Fi from fields. To construct
    a prototype with other required equipment, a TI CC 3200 (RFID) launchpad was used.

    Data reduction 4.1.1 Challenges, open issues, and research directions The knowledge-based
    architectures benefit traditional IoT infrastructures. The Knowledge Base is fabricated
    to store large, organized, and unstructured to support farmers or even people
    without previous agricultural knowledge (Halder and Singh (2021)). However, it
    takes work to find pertinent information about requirements. It is important to
    disseminate relevant knowledge and exact terms in a structured way. A knowledge-based
    system is made for improved extension and advisory services in farming improvements.
    Mohanraj et al. (2016) suggested the required distribution of water between crops
    without intervention by farmers. The water fed to farms should be of outstanding
    quality, either by smart irrigation or other traditional processes. Researchers
    in aquaculture and agriculture have begun applying IoT systems and artificial
    intelligence (AI) technologies. The water quality management system developed
    by  Encinas et al. (2017) uses state-of-the-art automation techniques. Conventional
    irrigation systems have a big issue with water wastage and water dearth. Egypt
    faces a water delivery challenge from the Nile River to its surrounding nations,
    for example. A lot of research has been conducted to solve irrigation issues.
    Several businesses have established a smart irrigation system based on sensors.
    These technologies were developed for optimum water use, quality control, and
    eliminate severe issues (Jha et al. (2019)). Soil humidity and heat sensors communicate
    straight to the field-based embedded components. Young farmers would spend much
    more on robotics than elderly farmers are interested in deploying. The adoption
    of modern technologies demands that they be adopted progressively over time. The
    agriculture sector is increasingly moving towards precision farming. Individual
    plants can be controlled based on their individual needs. Deep Learning (DL) and
    other expanded approaches differentiate between various plants and flowers, helping
    farmers produce more organic flowers. With the growth in various varieties of
    fruits and vegetables, we can see an increase in diversity (Zhang et al. (2016)).
    Strategies based on AI are growing exponentially and can be used by DL to diagnose
    diseases in plants or the presence of unwanted weeds in a plantation. Greenhouse
    farming requires human involvement. However, it can give a specific atmosphere
    to plants (Pawar et al. (2018)). Here, wireless technology and IoT innovations
    come into play to introduce weather forecasting and control on a farm without
    human intervention. The harvesting of crops and fruits can be achieved by using
    robots that efficiently operate around the clock. Robotics assist with many facets
    of farming, including seeding, planting, fertilization, spraying, harvesting,
    and tending. To execute the same job, hiring a reasonable number of staff is also
    appropriate. Thermal imaging may also provide monitoring using drones. Drones
    can monitor the field and offer continuous real-time information so that farmers
    know which area of the field is smaller and can only irrigate the affected area.
    The use of drones can ensure drought-free and ample water for crops, and crops
    will receive appropriate quantities of water. Many varied interconnected methods
    exist to create a viable ecosystem and maximize the growth of plants. 4.2 Smart
    cities The massive yet significant use of IoT applications can be seen in  smart
    cities (Ghafir et al. (2018)). Smart cities are primarily introduced to tackle
    particular problems associated with the welfare of people, for instance, traffic
    control, electricity, transport, and schooling. Smart cities rely heavily on intelligent
    sensors for data collection, such as temperature, moisture, toxicity, and road
    conditions, as depicted in Figure 4. Home sensors can monitor water supplies,
    schedules, pressure, and more. In particular, smart meters for payments of bills
    can be tracked by users (Ni et al. (2017)). Intelligent traffic control is another
    smart city technique that enables the control of traffic flow in reaction to the
    request, primarily with data gathered from numerous sensors in the area. These
    smart city implementations contribute to increasing data, creating various difficulties
    and problems, including data privacy and protection. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint A smart city. Smart cities strive to handle more sustainable urbanization
    and electricity use, preserve a green climate, and boost residents'' economic
    well-being and livelihoods. Smart cities expand people''s capacity to use new
    Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) effectively (Synowiec (2021)).
    ICT plays a significant role in planning, decision-making, execution, and deployment
    of efficient services and policies concerning the smart cities concept. This analysis
    focuses on the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML as well as Deep
    Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the development of intelligent cities (França
    et al. (2021)). The above mentioned methods effectively develop optimal strategies
    for multiple dynamic smart city concerns. IoT is now the most relevant and substantial
    aspect of most smart city applications responsible for producing a large amount
    of data (Al-Turjman (2017), Al-Turjman (2018)). Amid such large and dynamic details,
    the most reliable and successful behavior is difficult to assess correctly. The
    most sophisticated approaches, including ML, AI, and DRL can achieve maximal processing
    of big data (Liu et al. (2019), Allam and Dhunny (2019). Examples of smart city
    applications pose a host of security issues (Hashmi and Tariq (2023)). Zero-day
    attacks can occur in smart city networks due to the exploits of various protocols
    (Diro et al. (2021)). Second, is it necessary to evaluate a computer attack in
    a timely fashion so that operations of the smart city can be kept safe? Third,
    because IoT devices are space-restricted in smart cities, they have onboard functional
    limitations and transfer captured data for processing to the cloud. Current intrusion
    security systems do not consider IoT''s current infrastructure. Therefore, it
    is crucial to answer. Considering these issues, can we create an intrusion detection
    system (IDS) for IoT networks? The data derived from IoT architecture is processed
    in a cloud computing platform currently evolving (Tariq, Asim, and Khan (2019)).
    The data stored in the cloud is high, making computers leaned on to process this
    information slow and unstable. Fog computing gives a potential solution to these
    problems. In exchange, fog field computers can share a greater computing volume
    in the cloud. Fog computing will help improve internet connectivity networks by
    reducing energy and message overheads (Tariq et al. (2020)). Furthermore, fog
    computing minimizes latency, data management, and distribution problems. It would
    accelerate edge computing, seeking IoT-based technologies in smart city development.
    In Pahl and Aubet (2018), the authors developed an ML-based technique that can
    foresee service behavior in IoT environments based on machine interactions alone.
    The authors implemented K-means and BIRCH clustering methods in IoT systems. If
    data points in the center of a cluster are three times the standard deviation
    apart from the five standard deviation marks, they may be called one cluster.
    The paradigm used online networking training regimes to reform cluster development.
    In Alrashdi et al. (2019), LGL was a node recognition system to secure IoT. The
    authors used a random forest classifier that found only 12 of the 49 characteristics
    of the UNSW-NB15 dataset. These 12 attributes have been tested using the Extra
    Tree Classifier. In Vinayakumar et al. (2019), a DL algorithm was used to characterize
    the CICIDS 2017, NSL-KDD, WSN-DS, and UNSW-NB15 datasets for cyber assaults. The
    authors found DL to perform better than other ML methods. Several structures based
    on ensemble methods have been proposed in the literature for accuracy enhancement
    over base classifiers. In Shrivas and Dewangan (2014), a net-dependent collection
    was proposed to achieve selection performance and evaluated on both the NSL-KDD
    and KDD''99 datasets. Haq et al. (2020) combined Bayesian Network with the decision
    tree classifier. The researchers retrieved standard features through several techniques.
    In Zhou et al. (2020), the authors propose a correlation-based feature selection
    technique called CFS, accompanied by an ensemble-based feature selection technique
    combined to create the IDS model. They used NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2017, and AWID datasets,
    achieving 99.8%, 99.5%, and 99.8% accuracy respectively on the mentioned datasets.
    Khraisat et al. (2019) combined C5 with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect
    intrusion. The study focused on identifying standard instructions and zero-day
    attacks on a Robot-IoT network using the Bot-IoT dataset (Koroniotis et al. (2019)).
    The study found that hybrid approaches increased intrusion detection accuracy
    compared to previous methods. The above strategies are based on a long-term target
    and can give rise to the right or nearest possible control decisions (Li et al.
    (2017)). The volume of training data can improve their training ability and thereby
    automatic decision-making effectiveness (Ramchurn et al. (2012)), while higher
    amounts of data can improve both accuracy and precision of the above mentioned
    techniques. In Allam and Newman (2018), the authors demonstrated that the idea
    of realizing smart cities and sophisticated data processing tools for big data
    emerged roughly at the same time. Table 4 summarizes a few ML-based state-of-the-art
    supporting smart cities. TABLE 4. Smart cities and machine learning. Ref. Year

    will be a significant influence on everyday lives because of AI. Advances in AI
    have profoundly influenced human culture. Moreover, this study indicates “how
    AI policies and regulations can be developed to ensure social and economic development”
    In Chackravarthy et al. (2018), the authors suggested a practical crime-detecting
    framework focused on DRL and neural networks to classify and interpret crime effectively.
    This paper offers an ML-based architecture that can predict the event before it
    occurs. DRL and AI play a crucial role in developing automated and smart infrastructure.
    Because of new advances, smart cities can be realized in the immediate future.
    In Veres and Moussa (2019), the authors explored the advantages of ML and DRL
    in advanced intelligent transportation systems, including traffic flow, fleet
    control, customer searching, channel prediction, crash probability, road pricing,
    and vehicle greening. DRL strategies and edge computing operate well in a smart
    city setting. In  Yi et al. (2019), the authors use a DRL-focused approach to
    forecast traffic intensity on a highway. This article suggested a new driving
    behavior model based on DRL. The authors researched Deep Long Short Term (DLST)
    memory and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for data processing of the Gyeongbu
    Expressway in South Korea. A smart city must have a reliable data transmission
    system to collect, process, and transfer data to assure trustworthy and effective
    digital services. Cybersecurity concerns have been growing because of the accessibility
    of electronic records (Tariq and Khan (2018)). Most of the data in smart cities
    comes from cloud-based IoT computers. Some researchers are concentrating on the
    protection of IoT devices in smart cities and suggest a Random Forest (RF) ML-based
    architecture called Anomaly Detection-loT (AD-IoT) framework (Alrashdi et al.
    (2019)). The proposed methodology will detect suspicious behaviors in a distributed
    fog architecture network using a ML process. Elsaeidy et al. (2017) introduced
    an innovative architecture for information security in a smart city that observes
    citizens'' digital rights and liberties. The new model detects intruders early
    based on data habits, keeping the network secure. This advanced smartphone technology
    is key to designing safe and confidential smart city applications (apps). In Alli
    and Alam (2019), the authors provided a stable computation offloading system in
    a Fog-Cloud-IoT environment for performance enhancement. The proposed architecture
    would protect IoT devices and gateways and allow computation offloading at viable
    nodes using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The suggested system is more robust
    than its competitors in latency minimization. The authors suggested the design
    of edge cognitive computing networks and ran an experimental analysis. In Aloqaily
    et al. (2019), the authors foresaw a cloud-based, high-performance, stable engine
    that could respond to cloud attacks and satisfy the users'' Quality of Services
    (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) objectives. An intrusion detection method
    consists of three stages: traffic data processing, compression, and classifying
    the system''s requests. Simulation findings have proven that the device operates
    effectively. In Manesh et al. (2019), the authors speak about how Global Positioning
    System (GPS) spoofing can solve public and military Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs).
    The authors recommended an ML-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for detecting
    GPS spoofing attacks. The proposed technologies define GPS signals based on specific
    parameters, including Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Doppler shift, and pseudo-range.
    This protocol detects GPS spoofing attacks with some likelihood and uncovers other
    GPS tampering. In Lin et al. (2019), the researchers used software to counter
    jamming attempts against airborne Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The proposed
    methodology can be implemented irrespective of the jammer''s geographic position,
    model, and channel. This methodology evaluates and optimizes UAV trajectories
    and power levels according to determining UAV power transmission efficiency. Apps
    focused on AI, ML, and DRL have demonstrated positive outcomes from the recent
    literature on smart cities. On the other hand, research and market experts should
    concentrate on the following open study problems to use the AI Salau et al. (2022),
    ML, and DRL methodology to attain overall benefit. For improved decision-making
    processes, a wide range of training samples (e.g., vehicle speed, location, distance
    between vehicles, riders'' actions, UAVs altitude, and relay base stations) are
    needed. The combined enhancement of UAV onboard technologies (e.g., storage, computation,
    filtering, and detecting and connectivity resources) and its flight path using
    ML will increase the performance of land vehicles-UAV communication. There is
    a precise use for the interoperability of Smart Grids (SG) and 5G network infrastructures
    for efficient communication of modern technologies. It is imperative to consider
    the delayed assessment when designing a contact network. Through ML and DRL, techniques
    that allow shifting to 5-and 6G connectivity technologies (Kamruzzaman (2023))
    while ensuring power supply can be created. In smart cities, security challenges
    are seen as an application issue. Due to a security breach, Smart Grids could
    face significant financial losses. Advancement and deployment of big data analytics
    would be key to smart cities'' cyber safety and support. 4.3 Smart homes People
    invest heavily in intelligent homes to be economical and manage their properties
    and lifestyles. Smart homes use actuators and sensors connected to devices and
    appliances connected remotely to home routers. They can interact with one another
    to continue providing clients with a user-friendly interface. Smart homes are
    equipped with sensors that continuously capture data from the environment and
    conduct smart functions such as intelligent switching on and off of lights, controlling
    gadgets and appliances, controlling temperature, and protecting, as shown in Figure
    5. However, data obtained is different because sensors have diverse natures. Sensors
    are deployed, for instance, to automatically detect dampness, gas leakage, fire
    detection, temperature changes, and for other reasons. The sensors are used in
    many ways. For example, if there is a gas leakage, it immediately disconnects
    gas appliances. Floor sensors are often installed to monitor the pressure and
    residents'' movements to detect any suspicious motion. Smart households also use
    tracking cameras to capture residents'' behavior or movement (Zhou et al. (2013)).
    Energy conservation is another essential feature that can be accomplished by applying
    smart home applications (Lyu et al. (2017)). ML is an effective technique for
    analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends. It involves learning
    from data by making decisions using trial and error. After training a ML algorithm
    on a set of walking and jogging data, an ML algorithm can classify future data
    points as walking or jogging (Qolomany et al. (2019)). ML allows a system to be
    developed quickly without any human input. One can create more self-driving and
    collaborative systems. ML enriches computer science''s strengths in analyzing
    big data in understanding semantics and context (Shah et al. (2021)). To employ
    enhancement strategies, pertinent information should be collected. ML algorithms
    can forecast future trends from data (Akhlaghi et al. (2021)). ML can also be
    used as a part that helps in pattern recognition (Subbarao et al. (2021)). Nest
    Thermostat1 provides an example of a device for setting a room''s temperature
    based on the occupant''s preferences. Many AI platforms can learn from humans
    and other complex behavior patterns. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    A smart home. Intelligent systems have been developed to solve unforeseen problems
    with adaptability (Li and Yuan (2020)). Researchers have explored strategies to
    ensure that people with dementia will learn how to perform a simple job. Altun
    et al. (2010) examined body-worn inertial and magnetic sensors for human activity
    detection. Mozer (1998) solved occupant comfort management in smart homes using
    neural networks and reinforcement learning. Hsu et al. (2007) suggest a TV recommendation
    system that uses a neural network based on user specifics such as expectations
    and moods. Fleury et al. (2009) proposed a smart home device focused on sensors
    that track and understand daily life and healthcare needs and procedures. Parnandi
    et al. (2009) propose an indoor localization strategy using sensors in smartphones.
    They monitor consumers'' positions. Verbert et al. (2017) used a Bayesian method
    to understand the faults in heating systems. The model has been established considering
    empirical evidence and an overabundance of knowledge. Humans have used Naive Bayes
    algorithms in daily task recognition. These have been useful in some cases. The
    Naive Bayes algorithm defines human actions, which can be associated with sensor
    readings. Fu et al. (2015) say that it is possible to estimate electricity use
    at buildings with sub-metered systems. The system monitors people and their motions
    in a network of nearby smart homes. Petersen et al. (2012) developed a framework
    based on wireless motion sensors for automatically classifying tourists. Fleury
    et al. (2009) researched a smart home that automatically performs different daily
    activities. The research was done to test various sensors using an infrared presence
    monitor, vibration detectors, temperature and humidity sensors, and microphones.
    Petersen et al. (2012) established a system that categorized behaviors automatically
    in real-time inside smart home environments. Chen and Lin (2014) suggested an
    ML tool using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    to forecast energy consumption based on temperature and heater information. Badlani
    and Bhanot (2011) applied pattern recognition techniques to check energy efficiency
    in homes. Researchers have applied ANN to context-aware services in various contexts.
    The authors developed a model that estimates the probability of each part of the
    building being occupied or unoccupied in (Qolomany et al. (2019)). Ermes et al.
    (2008) combined ANN and apriori knowledge to classify common activities such as
    sitting, eating, walking, playing sports, waving, having sex, and hiking. This
    paper establishes a neural network to predict electricity production and power
    consumption. Fahad et al. (2014) proposed that product diversity could be leveraged
    using clustering. They applied the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to defend against
    harm. Bourobou and Yoo (2015) suggests an adaptive approach to predicting users''
    behavior in the smart world. They use cluster analysis to evaluate and rate user
    interactions and artificial neural networks to differentiate between users'' behaviors
    in their personal spaces. The key target of the learning issue of daily living
    activities'' patterns (LUCA) has been discussed by Lapalu et al. (2013). The researchers
    use the Flocking algorithm to detect members of a study group due to illness.
    Aicha et al. (2014) present a ML method for detecting unique visits in smart homes.
    The model integrates multiple data sources to reveal the deeper truth. Table 5
    summarizes a few ML-based state-of-the-art supporting smart homes. TABLE 5. Smart

    With intelligent homes, space heating, and safety problems can be monitored while
    residing at home, and patients can also be monitored. Advances in smart home technology
    has given rise to various issues that threaten security and safety of the technology
    itself. The industry needs in-depth analysis to overcome these difficulties and
    make smart homes a practical reality. The inherent potential of smart home systems
    is the potential for violation of information security. It can be used as a lever
    to jeopardize the privacy and security of people. Encryption, database encryption,
    and secure networks for smart homes are vital for protecting smart homes. Secondly,
    various sensors are used in smart homes, such as actuators, heat, pressure, and
    fire sensors. Processes, hardware, applications, and business models are the same–centralized
    computing methods for network sensing and sensor control, data interconnection
    facilities, and access protocols. The gateway node plays a vital role in the operation
    of wireless sensor networks as it sends information to remote servers (Hassan
    et al. (2021)). Home automation''s future depends on robust algorithms and efficient
    data compression. The smart home is a dynamic technology where many smart devices
    are connected to a network. The system must be carefully designed with integration
    in mind. For example, Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are a simple and affordable
    way to light up and minimize the cost of power and services. Other sensing systems
    in a smart home monitor people''s well-being, regulate vital signs as well as
    rest cycles. These innovative devices will use low voltage and stronger batteries.
    Engineers have designed power sources to meet the requirements of their applications.
    Modularity, interoperability, and remote control are defining features for developing
    smart home devices (Gonzalez-Gil et al. (2022)). Devices will have a range of
    choices open to the user. A standard and inter-operable interface for all home
    security systems is essential for smooth operation and navigation. While hardware-
    and IT-based, these devices should be compatible with promoting a common standard.
    AI can be used to automate home appliances to ensure the system''s self-sufficiency.
    AI technology will lead to more user-friendly homes. Therefore, there is a need
    for a method or methodology for using ML for decision-making and optimization.
    Standards should be created and implemented to simplify the implementation of
    AI features in smart homes. Much work needs to be done in smart homes, and it
    will benefit society as a whole through systems like a complete home automation
    system with in-home monitoring of its inhabitants. There seems to be a long way
    to go in constructing homes in the future. Different ML channels and tools are
    available to promote knowledge collection. It can still be challenging to select
    the right tool even though software for processing Big Data streaming has increased.
    Companies typically do not have a single solution to their diverse problems. Some
    toolkits can overlap and have their strengths and weaknesses. Practitioners with
    expertise in programming languages and system design will access several of these
    models (Barber and Krarti (2022)). Many citizens still lack knowledge of the different
    technology and platforms available. The reliability, data analysis speed, performance,
    support for various programming languages, and ease of use are essential considerations
    in selecting an ML tool. In a given case, one should consider the size and complexity
    of the data to be analyzed when implementing a specific toolkit. The library''s
    operating and programming framework affects search speed (Chi and Chi (2022)).
    Speed is not emphasized in all projects, however, speed is a significant factor.
    Coverage checks on how many ML algorithms inside the method are available. Due
    to the large quantities of data collected from heterogeneous sources, ML culture
    needs help interpreting and learning from multiple sources of data. Many existing
    large-data tools do not include all versions of all different ML algorithms (Farooq
    et al. (2022)). Most ML algorithms typically cover a couple of dozen different
    types of instruments. Elements such as initial setup work, ongoing maintenance,
    different programming, user interfaces, and online user guides are part of the
    usability aspect. The extensibility of the model means that partially finished
    structures can be assembled and made scalable (Kakandwar et al. (2023)). ML-based
    algorithms must be checked to see if they can meet these criteria. A variety of
    ML algorithms in many programming languages is available. Different languages,
    libraries, and software may be more efficient than others, depending on the job
    that needs to be done. Several computer systems need real-time data processing,
    which is why data cannot be archived. Stream treatment aims to analyze vast information
    in real-time and use the same data to handle this tremendous amount of information
    by using continuous queries like SQL-type queries. Streaming analysis is a crucial
    feature of stream processing for real-time streaming results accessibility. 4.4
    Smart grids Another realistic and dynamic implementation of IoT is intelligent
    grids (Jogunola et al. (2017)). Intelligent grids are now required to implement
    a distributed, user-funded, intelligent grid infrastructure to support a stable,
    effective, safe, and excellent power supply (Schulter (2010)). Smart grid infrastructure
    involves the intelligent two-way stream of information between user and operator.
    Sensors or IoT are connected (Jogunola et al. (2018)) at the customer''s location
    and power station. A sensor installed at the customer site provides data on energy
    usage, energy consumption habits, intelligent metering, prices, and other statistics.
    A depiction of the smart grid is shown in Figure 6. At grid stations sensors track
    transmission, distribution, supply disruption, area recognition, and customer
    data, to name just a few. All sensor readings are transmitted to their relative
    monitoring stations to produce reasonable alerts for intelligent and optimum electricity
    delivery. Explicit encryption and privacy solutions must be used to protect data
    protection and effectively implement smart grid infrastructures. FIGURE 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Smart grids. In green infrastructure, big data is
    a significant component of Smart Grid (SG) urban development. For the Smart City
    ecosystem''s growth, SG comes with the convergence of the new technology. Heterogeneous
    data from different sources are analyzed and exploited efficiently because of
    SG. There will be a chance to significantly strengthen smart cities through deep
    analytics and big data. The new trend reveals that SG use smart meter big data
    effectively on numerous apps such as load and forecast tests, baseline calculations,
    demand respondents, load clusters, and aggressive attacks on data deception (Karimipour
    et al. (2019), Du et al. (2019), Wang et al. (2018), Fallah et al. (2018), Tureczek
    et al. (2018)). SG primarily used for state estimation, dynamic model calibration,
    and transmission grid visualization. The authors in Ghorbanian et al. (2019) also
    performed an observational analysis using big data to find some critical applications.
    In Liang et al. (2019), the authors suggest a paradigm in which pooled energy
    is part of the SG structure to assist in finalizing logical government policies
    as a whole. A power management model would be helpful even in extreme weather
    and other unfavorable situation. The authors in Mujeeb, Javaid, et al. (2019)
    proposed a Deep Long Short Term Memory (DLSTM) order to estimate and evaluate
    energy prices and demand using actual electricity market data. The model efficiency
    was measured using Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE) as standard metrics. The DLSTM framework excelled in terms of its
    ability to forecast costs. In Pallonetto et al. (2019), a simulation-based architecture
    was built to evaluate and study the efficacy of the Demand Response (DR) strategy
    under various cost attributes. Two Distributed Resonance (DR) protocols monitor
    and regulate a fluid delivery system with a heat pump and thermal storage. Lee
    et al. (2019) created a component model that guides the development of ML-based
    software. Their model may reduce the number of expensive implementations and expert
    information interrupts. In Prasad et al. (2019), the authors have suggested an
    intrusion detection and location finding system using ML and power line modems,
    where Power Line Communication (PLC) relays any information to avoid further damage.
    Oyewumi et al. (2019) set up a security proof of concept for SingTel devices.
    It is the application for a reconfigurable distributed network that emulates power
    facility data. The authors discuss different challenging problems law enforcement
    encounters in Singapore. The authors in  An et al. (2019) suggested a Deep-Q-Network
    Detection (DQND) technique that can effectively counter energy attacks in buildings.
    The protocol is applied in a central network to master the optimum Defensive Rollout
    technique. In Jenssen and Roverso (2019), the authors explored ways to inspect
    the power line using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera
    tracks electric lines continuously, thus, the energy is better protected. The
    authors in  Shihavuddin et al. (2019) used DRL-based UAV to track wind turbines.
    The authors develop a UAV analysis method to determine the damages suffered by
    UAV and provide options for mitigation. The forecasting of electricity in Singapore
    is significant, therefore, different models are available for predicting power
    charge (Kuster et al. (2017)) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF) projections
    bill minutes to hours, forecasting an interim load. The load from Short-Term Load
    Forecasting (STLF) is estimated to be at least one week in advance  (Moon et al.
    (2018),  Zheng et al. (2017)). Long-Term Load Forecasting (LTLF) (Moon et al.
    (2018)) could evaluate the next year''s load. Precise forecasts are particularly
    daunting if the load is non-static (Zheng et al. (2017)). Furthermore, load patterns
    depend on multiple characteristics, including events, weather, and training. The
    problem in Tong et al. (2018) is that those ML algorithms were used for load prediction
    algorithms. However, the attributes trained a model directly without independent
    pre-processing. It is easy to estimate the daily charge on electrical grids. An
    efficient and accurate forecasting model is needed to conserve money and minimize
    costs. Predicting area and city energy is a major concern. The improvement of
    the energy sector depends on regional and urban growth. It involves a detailed
    electrical load measurement model. In Qiu et al. (2018), the authors emphasize
    the difficult developments in load''s non-linear estimation. Although weighing
    has been traditionally represented in the Single hidden layer Feed-forward Neural
    Networks (SLFN), it takes time, and its gradient rise is still reduced locally.
    In Zhang et al. (2019), the authors find that their varying features and price
    fluctuations rendered detailed price predictions exceedingly difficult. Numerous
    price prediction models exist in the literature, and the authors explain two major
    problems that affect the correctness of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Secondly,
    hybrid models cannot produce stability and effectiveness in conjunction with linear
    and non-linear models. Renewable Energy Resources (RES) are unreliable in electricity
    generation. The basic series of periods was based on theories, including correlations
    and variance clustering. However, the price-to-base relationship needs to be addressed.
    The authors in Wang et al. (2017) have found that modern price prediction techniques
    cannot accommodate tremendous knowledge of pricing. Function compilation does
    not help to remove duplication. Advanced electricity pricing synchronization systems
    also lack in-depth security measures. In Angamuthu Chinnathambi et al. (2019),
    energy stability was handled. The authors highlighted that due to many visible
    and unseen factors, electricity rates in the power sector are highly stable, as
    is the rise in usage of SG. Precise short-term forecasting is expected, as it
    is relevant to purchasers and sellers. In (Samuel et al. (2020), Khalid et al.
    (2020), Mujeeb and Javaid (2019), Mujeeb, Alghamdi, et al. (2019), Naz, Javaid,
    et al. (2019), Naz, Javed, et al. (2019), Mujeeb, Javaid, et al. (2019)) the researchers
    pointed to price estimation concerns and load forecasts. Table 6 summarizes a

    open issues, and research directions There has been a rise in decision-making
    trees in Moon et al. (2018). However, it is inefficient for an increased number
    of trees (i.e., if more than 128) due to the need for more resources to process.
    Simple Moving Average (SMA) forecasts load. However, it is prone to more uncertainty
    (i.e., sudden fluctuations) in a short time than in long distances. Therefore,
    SMA shows no positive effects in a brief time. In Tong et al. (2018), seasonal
    features are used and passed to train in Support Vector Regression (SVR). Overusing
    air conditioning and heating ensures that the summer and winter load increases.
    Big data spikes affect accuracy in summer and winter months and leads to unfortunate
    effects. However, in large-scale data, it may not perform well. In Qiu et al.
    (2017), data from the EMD transmitted to Deep Belief Network (DBN) was broken
    down. However, more machines and neural networks are required to predict load
    demands. However, an optimization technique can be used to improve a DL model''s
    efficiency because of its long time. The electric charge signal of the input is
    denoted by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) (Chen et al. (2018)), which is moved
    on to the prediction models, such as the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The Radial-Basis-Function
    (RBF) kernel with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) kernel is merged into a mixed
    kernel. However, EMD has a mode mixing problem. ELM predicts one move since it
    is an autonomous FFNN, even though its parameters cannot be easily modified. In
    Qiu et al. (2018), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for the problem mixing
    mode for EMD systems. Researchers have dealt with this problem, however, their
    results tend take longer to compress. As new input patterns can be updated, expanded
    learning of the Randomized Version Functional Link (RVFL) model is being used.
    Weights are adjusted based on the error rate. Despite this, RVFL has a compelling
    potential to approximate as it takes time to compute. In Fan et al. (2019), short-
    and medium-term issues of customers'' appetite may be combined. In Zhang et al.
    (2018), advanced models are used to pick the best energy cost prediction inputs,
    while hybrid models will also have more considerations. The PSR-BSK model introduced
    in Fan et al. (2018) can be generalized to provide accurate demand estimates for
    policymakers regarding natural gas forecasts. Wang et al. (2016) were interested
    in choosing the correct responses to target results. However, the authors cannot
    prove it is the correct feedback for the model. Moreover, computational overhead
    and computational latency are high. Their results lack precise model outcomes
    in summer, fall, and spring because of high business instability. If phases are
    fewer than 10, multi-stage projections have good outcomes, otherwise, poor results
    arise. Additional considerations are also used in Zhang et al. (2019) to improve
    price prediction efficiency as data are available to market participants from
    public sources. In Lago et al. (2018), the proposed algorithm would maximize forecasting
    accuracy results using four more deep learning models, including auto-encoders.
    Expert guidance should also examine independent benchmarks. A whole variety of
    studies would also investigate the model''s effectiveness. The final prices were
    less accurate in (Keles et al. (2016)). The model currently yields a lower cost
    than it currently does. Price adjustments are just obviously accountable. ANN
    is determined from historical documents. The model has to be revised and equalized
    if the company''s configuration or large quantities of added capability are altered.
    Differential Evolution (DE) was used for tuning parameters in (Wang et al. (2017)).
    However, DE follows the local maximum. Furthermore, DE may only fill part of the
    screening area. The machine time and complexity of the instrument model are high.
    The exactness of the RF projection is slight. It reduces the accuracy of the measurement
    of waste. In the suggested model, large datasets may be analyzed (Angamuthu Chinnathambi
    et al. (2019)) to see how the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values are
    affected. 4.5 Smart healthcare In smart healthcare, significant operations are
    automated using e-health systems based on intelligent IoT (Sharma, Al-Wanain,
    et al. (2022), Nepal et al. (2015), Nayak et al. (2022)). Scientists have established
    a vast range of functional intelligent devices that track patients'' conditions
    of health on the whole, as shown in Figure 7. These instruments maintain a log
    of the patient''s health and give a warning in the event of unusual behavior.
    For instance, smart e-health systems help senior citizens and disabled people
    cope with their mobility. It is possible to use IoT devices to distantly capture
    and relay this information to significant health data collection and diagnostic
    centers (e.g., cardiovascular, blood pressure, and anatomy data) (Luong et al.
    (2016), Sharma, Al-Wanain, et al. (2022)). The most critical risks to healthcare
    facilities are data protection and privacy of the patient data collected for medical
    purposes (Djenouri et al. (2022), Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019)). FIGURE
    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Smart healthcare. Identifying human behaviors
    is crucial to getting a smart health monitoring program. Smart health faces problems
    because of the expansive variety of acts and gestures. It is another tough challenge
    as IoT needs many interconnected data points. DL is a fantastic candidate to create
    solutions to this issue. The biggest challenge with using massive datasets in
    ML is to label appropriate data to train the algorithm properly (Moqurrab et al.
    (2022a)). DL has arisen as a well-developed technique for computing useful and
    meaningful representations of raw data without analytical or domain knowledge.
    As part of this effort, patients provide many highly sensitive details (Moqurrab
    et al. (2022a)). RL trains on a reward system algorithm. RL indicates what action
    the program agent should take in the specified case. Regarding RL, we should focus
    on the principle of edge caching for flow. However, there is room for strategy,
    and space for the state is very wide (Hu (2018)). DL is used on both low and high-dimension
    models. The large time-scale model was developed to reduce timesteps. Consequently,
    this model approximates the carrots and sticksitems that incentivize the organization
    to hold the tags present. However, its technological feature is too abstract,
    making it very hard to incorporate in the real world. With this concept as inspiration,
    Hu (2018) modeled PSO for a large time-scale model. PSO achieves optimum global
    results with easy integration and strong stability. However, setup and parameters
    are modified during random access scenarios. In large time-scale models, optimum
    solutions are then chosen. It should be noted that a large time-scale model appears
    to have controlled solutions, while a small time-scale model needs to be re-tuned.
    The present healthcare system has several consequences of using IoT and pervasive
    computing. With the help of implanting medical equipment and fitness trackers
    in hospital facilities (Tariq et al. (2020)), Smart Healthcare Systems (SHS) can
    track and manage the health status of all patients (Vaas (2013)). Smart healthcare
    will theoretically exacerbate patients‘ experience across several legal loopholes.
    Expanded advances in technology have been effective in healing individuals of
    diseases. Medical networks and advances in sensing and IoT technologies have increased
    in complexity and reach. It is just not restricted to medicinal uses only. It
    also includes implantable and wearable medical devices that monitor multiple facets
    of a patient''s everyday health. Bluetooth technology will offer a holistic approach
    to the early detection of diseases (Di Marco et al. (2021)). Smart healthcare
    is a vital service in terms of work and counseling to boost a person''s healthcare
    level. Recently, there have been many cybersecurity concerns in this domain. Healthcare
    data is in its early stage and potentially more reliable than financial services
    and retail data. In the last few years, experts sought to block pacemaker-wearing
    cancer patients from transmitting and receiving wireless messages. Researchers
    have shown numerous cyber-attacks on these Implantable Medical Devices (IMD) (Li
    et al. (2011)). IMD raises security issues and data privacy. Health problems should
    be closely attended to prevent permanent injuries. This area includes regulatory
    agencies, information technology communities, and medical equipment makers to
    comply fully. Many “device-specific solutions” are available to protect against
    ransomware attacks on mobile phones. A lightweight architecture called “REBEL”
    (Lamech and Plusquellic (2012)) was built to investigate hardware failures in
    several platforms. It is important to narrow the means of communication to mitigate
    the risk of accessing unauthorized interaction. Near Field Connectivity and Radio
    Frequency Identification (RFID) may also be used as they are used for limited
    communication. Near-Field IDentification (NFID) (Freudenthal et al. (2007)) is
    an easy and cost-efficient way to identify devices.  Al Alkeem et al. (2015) suggested
    an authentication scheme based on a wearable interface. Sangpetch and Sangpetch
    (2016) proposed a system that can be customized and developed for particular circumstances.
    Here, Abie and Balasingham (2012) employed a theory about protection for the case.
    Similarly (Ali et al. (2020), Newaz et al. (2019), Pandey and Prabha (2020), Subiksha
    and Ramakrishnan (2021), and Zahin and Hu (2019)) proposed ML-based smart healthcare
    solutions. Table 7 summarizes a few ML-based state-of-the-art supporting smart
    healthcare. TABLE 7. Smart healthcare and machine learning. Ref. Year ML model

    (2021) 2021 Deep learning Unsupervised Healthcare diagnosis 4.5.1 Challenges,
    open issues, and research directions Emerging ubiquitous smartphones and sensor-rich
    applications also enhanced these triggers of actions in smart healthcare. Several
    uses benefit from smart healthcare, from mechanical checks to dental checkups
    and wellness treatments. Effective use of healthcare relies significantly upon
    factors such as accelerometer readings. A variety of experiments have been performed
    on this. However, only a few practical methods have been proposed to eliminate
    the following issues: The rapid rise in smart devices has led to a need to mark
    information. The main issue is creating a learning model to observe and measure
    critical behavior characteristics. Many sensors in IoT can participate in generating
    big data in the smart health sector. Big data poses even more obstacles for ML
    systems. Big data based on AI and DL are exciting approaches that could overcome
    some of the issues relevant to 5G networks and IoT applications. Internet-based
    solutions can accomplish the mission of data processing because of the importance
    of big data. Work in compressive sensing has demonstrated that a sparse representation
    can be represented in a compressed form. In particular, in contrast to standard
    (Nyquist Santoso et al. (2020)) sampling, compact sampling can produce a signal
    at a rate lower than Nyquist''s criterion. The Min-LL approach can be applied
    by solving a convex optimization problem called min-LL with equality constraints.
    Some methods, such as basic chase, orthogonal matching pursuit, and tree-based
    orthogonal matching pursuit also increase the reconstruction''s completion. Several
    researchers have applied these developments to multiple real applications such
    as cognitive radio networks (Kong (2010), Kong and Bao (2010), Le and Kong (2011))
    and Smartgrids (Le (2015), Tan and Le (2016)). Efforts are being made to develop
    acoustic IoT-based compressed sensing frameworks (Kong (2010), Kong and Bao (2010),
    Le and Kong (2011)), which can operate in a distributed manner. Their suggested
    versions are far preferable to existing software regarding enterprise system features.
    Similarly, the authors in (Hu and Hanzo (2019), Hu (2018)) addressed the problem
    of shared networking, edge caching, and computing design of vehicle networks by
    learning novel methods. These AI programs have demonstrated to deliver operational
    excellence and productivity targets. In summary, enterprise systems are successful
    if an applied ML process adopts it. Daunting problems like massive machines and
    big data can be avoided. This suggests that current AI systems could have viable
    solutions with minimal computing costs and excellent stability. Algorithms used
    to render any estimation may be inefficient for any practical application. Furthermore,
    statistical methodologies focused on dataset features found in each sample can
    be time inefficient. Combining sophisticated ML methods with classical algorithms
    is essential for accurate and efficient data processing. 5 USE CASES This section
    presents some use cases illustrating the potential of integrating enterprise architecture,
    IoT, and ML across multiple domains. These examples illustrate the practical applications
    and benefits that can be realized due to this convergence. Smart city management:
    Integrating enterprise architecture, IoT, and ML presents a compelling use case
    in smart city management. Cities can improve their efficiency, sustainability,
    and residents'' quality of life by deploying IoT sensors, accumulating real-time
    data, and implementing ML algorithms. Traffic management: ML techniques can be
    used to analyze massive amounts of data generated by IoT sensors deployed in urban
    environments. By analyzing this data, traffic patterns and congestion locations
    can be identified, enabling city officials to optimize traffic signal timings,
    re-route vehicles, and enhance overall traffic flow. ML models can account for
    historical traffic data, meteorological conditions, and events to predict traffic
    congestion and proactively implement measures to alleviate it. It can reduce travel
    durations, lower fuel consumption, and enhance air quality. Energy management:
    IoT-enabled Smart Grids can use ML algorithms to forecast energy demand and optimize
    energy distribution. ML models can alter energy production and distribution in
    real-time by analyzing historical consumption patterns, weather forecasts, and
    other pertinent data, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing waste. ML
    models can, for instance, dynamically regulate the allocation of energy resources
    in response to demand fluctuations and prioritize renewable energy sources when
    conditions are favorable. It can result in cost savings, lower environmental impact,
    and improved grid reliability. Industrial automation: Integrating enterprise architecture,
    IoT, and ML can revolutionize automation processes in industrial settings, resulting
    in increased productivity, quality, and safety. Predictive maintenance: Enterprises
    can implement predictive maintenance strategies by deploying IoT sensors on machinery
    and employing ML algorithms. In conjunction with historical maintenance records,
    real-time sensor data can train ML models to detect patterns and anomalies indicative
    of imminent equipment failures. These models can predict when a machine will require
    maintenance, allowing for preventative measures to be taken prior to a malfunction.
    By scheduling maintenance duties based on actual equipment conditions, businesses
    can reduce unscheduled downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and avoid expensive
    repairs. Predictive maintenance increases operational efficiency, extends the
    equipment''s life, and decreases overall maintenance costs. Quality control: In
    manufacturing facilities, ML algorithms can analyze data from IoT-connected sensors
    and cameras to detect defects and anomalies in real-time. ML models can identify
    deviations from expected quality standards and initiate alerts or automate corrective
    actions by continuously monitoring production lines. For instance, Computer Vision
    (CV) algorithms can analyze camera-captured images to identify product flaws such
    as blemishes and incorrect labeling. ML models can also analyze sensor data to
    identify anomalies in parameters such as temperature, pressure, and vibration
    that may indicate problems with production. Enterprises can ensure consistent
    product quality, reduce waste, and increase customer satisfaction by enabling
    real-time quality control. These use cases illustrate the advantages and real-world
    applications of integrating enterprise architecture, IoT, and ML in smart city
    management and industrial automation domains. By leveraging the potential of IoT
    and ML, businesses can transform their operations, enhance their decision-making,
    and unlock new growth and innovation opportunities. Integrating these technologies
    facilitates more efficient resource allocation, proactive decision-making, and
    automation of manual processes, ultimately resulting in increased productivity,
    cost savings, and enhanced overall performance in various industries. Security
    considerations: Integrating ML and IoT into enterprise architectures presents
    new security challenges and considerations. As IoT devices become pervasive and
    ML algorithms process sensitive data, ensuring the system''s confidentiality,
    availability, and integrity becomes crucial. Data privacy: The confidentiality
    of IoT-device-collected data is a major concern for deployments of ML and IoT.
    These devices frequently capture a wide variety of data, including personal information,
    which must be protected to comply with privacy regulations and prevent unauthorized
    access. For training purposes, ML algorithms may require access to large datasets,
    necessitating the cautious handling of sensitive information. To safeguard the
    privacy of individuals while still facilitating effective ML models, businesses
    must implement robust data anonymization techniques, encryption mechanisms, and
    access controls. Adversarial attacks: ML models are susceptible to adversarial
    assaults, in which malicious actors manipulate input data to deceive models and
    obtain incorrect or undesirable results. In the IoT context, adversaries may exploit
    vulnerabilities in connected devices to feed malicious data to ML algorithms,
    resulting in potentially detrimental decisions or actions. To mitigate the risk
    of adversarial attacks, businesses must employ robust model training, anomaly
    detection, and input validation techniques. In addition, maintaining a secure
    ML and IoT environment necessitates continuous monitoring of the system and regular
    updates to counteract emergent threats. System resilience: As ML and IoT systems
    become more interconnected and integrated into vital infrastructure, ensuring
    the overall system''s resilience is crucial. Implementing robust security measures,
    IoT devices, ML algorithms, and underlying infrastructures must be protected from
    unauthorized access, tampering, and disruption. Implementing secure communication
    protocols, access controls, and intrusion detection systems are included. Regular
    security audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response plans are required
    to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Model poisoning: ML models
    can be susceptible to model poisoning attacks, in which adversaries manipulate
    training data to degrade the model''s performance or introduce biases. In the
    IoT context, compromised or malicious devices may inject fraudulent data into
    training sets, resulting in inaccurate or biased ML models. Organizations must
    implement data validation techniques, anomaly detection algorithms, and robust
    model validation procedures to mitigate the risk of model poisoning. Regular re-training
    of ML models with updated and validated data can help maintain a system''s precision
    and dependability. By addressing these security concerns, businesses can ensure
    that their ML and IoT systems are trustworthy and reliable. To protect sensitive
    data, maintain system integrity, and prevent malicious attacks, it is essential
    to implement stringent security measures, adhere to privacy regulations, and employ
    proactive security practices. As the integration of ML and IoT continues to evolve,
    it is crucial to make security an integral part of the enterprise architecture
    to cultivate trust and confidence in the system''s capabilities. 6 DISCUSSION
    In the context of enterprise architectures, this survey thoroughly investigated
    the interaction between ML and IoT. This paper highlighted how ML techniques could
    improve IoT-based enterprise systems and gathered recent studies to give readers
    a complete understanding of the topic. The main conclusions are expanded upon
    in this discussion, which also examines the ramifications for enterprise design
    and IoT applications like smart grids and smart cities. Enterprise designs have
    become more complex and varied, particularly in the context of IoT systems. Significant
    opportunities exist to increase the functionality and automation of these structures
    by including ML techniques. ML algorithms can analyze the enormous volume of data
    IoT devices produce to identify relevant patterns and get important insights.
    For instance, ML can optimize resource allocation, traffic management, and energy
    usage in smart cities. More effective use of resources and improved quality of
    life for residents can be achieved by using ML algorithms to analyze data from
    numerous IoT sensors and devices around cities. Similarly, ML approaches can be
    extremely useful in Smart Grids for maximizing energy distribution, forecasting
    demand, and spotting abnormalities. ML algorithms may predict energy use patterns,
    find faults or future failures, and enable preventive maintenance by evaluating
    real-time data from IoT devices integrated into the grid infrastructure. This
    survey found many opportunities and use cases where ML and IoT integration can
    significantly improve enterprise systems. ML can be used in the context of smart
    cities for intelligent traffic management, proactive infrastructure maintenance,
    and reducing building energy use. Cities can operate more sustainably and efficiently,
    lowering traffic, enhancing safety, and using less energy by utilizing ML algorithms.
    ML approaches can help with load forecasting, anomaly identification, and problem
    diagnostics in Smart Grids. ML models can reliably estimate energy demand, detect
    anomalous consumption patterns indicative of tampering or malfunctions, and identify
    the underlying cause of system failures by evaluating historical and real-time
    data from IoT devices distributed throughout the grid. Additionally, ML can improve
    enterprise architecture''s cybersecurity protocols. Businesses may spot possible
    security breaches and take proactive steps to reduce risks by utilizing ML algorithms
    for anomaly detection and threat analysis. Additionally, ML can help with network
    monitoring, behavior analysis, and intrusion detection, enabling real-time reactions
    to security threats. Despite potential advantages, ML and IoT integration in enterprise
    architectures face several obstacles that must be overcome. The management of
    large-scale and heterogeneous IoT data presents a significant problem. This data
    must be processed and examined by ML algorithms on time, with the ability to extract
    pertinent features. The main emphasis of research should be the development of
    scalable and distributed ML algorithms that can manage the amount, diversity,
    and collection speed of IoT data. In IoT systems, privacy and security issues
    present serious difficulties. As sensitive data is gathered and processed by corporate
    infrastructures, protecting the privacy and accuracy of the data becomes crucial.
    To enable collaborative analysis while preserving data privacy, new research topics
    include the development of privacy-preserving ML techniques like federated learning,
    differential privacy, and secure multi-party computation (Javed et al. (2023)).
    The creation of interpretable ML models for enterprise architectures is another
    area of research. Understanding and explaining choices made by ML algorithms is
    essential in vital sectors like healthcare and autonomous systems, where explainability
    is a key component. The main research focus should be developing transparent,
    comprehensible ML models that can justify their outputs, increase trust, and simplify
    regulatory compliance. Furthermore, it is difficult to deploy ML algorithms because
    of resource limitations of IoT devices. These devices frequently have low energy
    capacity and are computational constrained. To reduce reliance on the cloud and
    save energy, research directions should include investigating edge computing strategies,
    where data processing and ML model inference occur locally on devices. This survey''s
    results show how powerful ML integration in IoT-based enterprise designs can be.
    ML approaches can improve decision-making, allocate resources more efficiently,
    and automate more applications, such as Smart Grids and smart cities. However,
    continual research and innovation are required to overcome issues with data management,
    privacy, interpretability, and resource limitations. Enterprises, academics, and
    decision-makers can successfully utilize the power of ML in IoT systems to build
    more effective, safe, and sustainable enterprise architectures by concentrating
    on these issues and research topics. Future intelligent and adaptive IoT-based
    enterprise systems will be made possible by continued cooperation and improvements
    in ML algorithms, data management approaches, and privacy-preserving strategies.
    Following is a summary of this survey''s major findings: System intelligence and
    automation have been improved by integrating ML and IoT in enterprise architectures.
    In numerous enterprise areas, ML techniques like supervised learning and anomaly
    detection have been successfully used to increase the adaptability and functionality
    of IoT-based services. Despite the many advantages of integrating ML with IoT,
    several difficulties and unresolved problems still need to be solved, such as
    concerns about data security and privacy, scalability, and compatibility between
    different platforms and devices. This study found various enterprise IoT use cases,
    including smart cities, smart grids, industrial automation, and smart healthcare,
    where ML has shown promise in streamlining procedures and making decisions. To
    achieve broad adoption and easy implementation in businesses, well-defined frameworks
    for integrating ML algorithms into already-existing IoT infrastructure are essential.
    Enterprise IoT systems still place a high priority on security, and ML-based security
    mechanisms have the potential to identify and counteract cyber threats in real-time.
    To provide predictive maintenance and proactive decision-making in enterprise
    IoT environments, this study emphasizes additional research and development in
    trend analysis and prognosis utilizing ML techniques. To realize the full potential
    of this integration, ongoing investigation and experimentation with new algorithms,
    methodologies, and data management strategies are imperative, given how quickly
    the fields of ML and IoT are evolving. In addition, this survey indicates that
    ML models are widely used in various domains, including smart agriculture, smart
    grids, smart cities, smart healthcare, and smart homes. As shown in Figure 8,
    supervised learning is the most commonly used type, accounting for 37.50% of applications,
    followed by unsupervised learning at 25.00%. Supervised learning is crucial for
    crop health analysis, resource allocation optimization, and yield prediction.
    Unsupervised learning dominates Smart Grids, accounting for 40.00% of applications,
    while reinforcement learning plays a minor role. Smart cities have an equal percentage
    of supervised and unsupervised learning models, with reinforcement learning employed
    in 16.67% of cases. ML techniques are essential for analyzing heterogeneous data
    in smart cities, enabling tasks such as traffic management, energy optimization,
    and public safety. Supervised learning is the most prevalent model in healthcare,
    accounting for 42.86% of applications. Unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    are significant, with 28.57% and 14.29%, respectively. Semi-supervised learning
    is used in 14.29% of cases, while hybrid models have no representation. Smart
    homes also use supervised and unsupervised learning models, with reinforcement
    learning playing a smaller role in 20.00% of applications. However, specific requirements,
    available data, and desired outcomes drive the choice of ML models in each domain.
    FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison among different ML model
    utilization. Based on our study, the following are future recommendations: ML-based
    Security Mechanisms: Building on the significance of security, developing advanced
    ML-based security mechanisms uniquely tailored for enterprise IoT systems is mandatory.
    It would require investigating novel ML algorithms and techniques to detect and
    mitigate security threats, intrusions, and anomalies in real-time. In addition,
    the integration of ML with other emergent technologies, such as blockchain, could
    be investigated to improve security and reliability of IoT-based enterprise systems.
    Scalable ML Architectures: As enterprise IoT systems continue to increase in size
    and complexity, there is a need for scalable ML architectures that can manage
    the massive influx of data produced by IoT devices. Future research could investigate
    novel approaches for distributed ML processing, edge computing, and federated
    learning to enable efficient and scalable ML in enterprise IoT environments. These
    architectures should address the challenges of data heterogeneity, latency, and
    resource limitations while assuring high-performance ML operations. Enhanced analytics
    and decision-making: ML can facilitate sophisticated analytics and intelligent
    decision-making in enterprise IoT systems. Future research could concentrate on
    developing ML models and algorithms that can extract actionable insights from
    IoT data streams in real-time. It would entail investigating anomaly detection,
    predictive maintenance, and optimization algorithms to facilitate proactive enterprise
    decision-making, resource allocation, and process optimization. Integration with
    Cloud and Edge Computing: With the expansion of cloud and edge computing paradigms,
    future research could examine how ML can be incorporated seamlessly with these
    architectures to maximize the benefits of IoT-based enterprise systems. It may
    entail investigating techniques for efficient data offloading, model deployment,
    and training at the periphery, as well as leveraging the capabilities of cloud
    platforms for scalable and distributed ML processing. Ethical and responsible
    ML in IoT: The need for ethical and responsible ML practices increases as ML algorithms
    become increasingly influential in enterprise IoT systems. The ethical implications
    of deploying ML in business settings, such as impartiality, transparency, and
    accountability, may be further explored. It would involve developing frameworks
    and guidelines for the responsible deployment of ML, assuring the ethical use
    of data, and addressing the potential for bias and discrimination in ML algorithms.
    Interoperability and standardization: Given enterprise IoT systems'' heterogeneous
    and diverse nature, addressing interoperability issues and promoting standardization
    is inevitable. Common frameworks, protocols, and data models should be developed
    to facilitate the integration and interoperability of ML algorithms and IoT devices
    across enterprise domains. It would facilitate the efficient exchange and utilization
    of data within the enterprise IoT ecosystem, fostering collaboration and innovation.
    Table 8 summarizes the key findings of this manuscript regarding its established
    objectives and contributions. The first objective, which investigates the correlation
    between IoT and ML inside enterprise designs, is further supported by the finding
    that integrating ML and IoT contributes to improving enterprise automation. The
    objectives of Goals 2 and 4 involve examining how ML can enhance enterprise systems
    based on IoT and exploring different scenarios where ML can be applied. These
    goals are supported by research findings that demonstrate the ability of ML to
    enhance adaptability and functionality of IoT-based systems. Additionally, these
    findings demonstrate the potential of ML in domains such as smart cities and healthcare.
    Goal 3 of this study aims to evaluate benefits, limitations, and prospects of
    integrating ML and IoT in enterprise systems. This objective is achieved by emphasizing
    the ongoing challenges associated with this integration, particularly regarding
    data security and scalability. Moreover, the significance of well-defined frameworks,
    as indicated by Goal 5, is underscored by their crucial role in facilitating the
    effective execution of ML-IoT integration. Table 8 effectively establishes connections
    between significant discoveries and their corresponding objectives and impacts,

    ML in enabling independent, autonomous, and intelligent enterprise management
    in the IoT context. Integrating IoT systems with existing or newly built application
    systems has become a standard practice in today''s enterprises, necessitating
    a reworking of current EA models to accommodate the complexities and heterogeneity
    of IoT-based systems. ML can potentially enhance IoT-based enterprise systems
    through automation and intelligent decision-making. By applying ML techniques
    to IoT data, organizations can gain deeper insights and extract valuable information
    embedded in vast amounts of sensor data generated by IoT devices. ML models rapidly
    process this data, empowering IoT systems with knowledge and improving their operations
    and practices. ML has proven to be a significant technical breakthrough in addressing
    various IoT concerns, such as safeguarding smart systems and objects and recognizing
    suspicious activities. Enhancing and automating services offered by enterprise
    systems is essential to address these issues and attract more customers. A substantial
    amount of progress has been made in research on ML for enterprise architectures
    with IoT, revealing the potential of IoT to benefit from ML assistance in various
    domains. Users can achieve in-depth analytics and develop highly intelligent IoT
    applications by leveraging ML in IoT-based enterprise systems. Future exploration
    is needed to devise an ML-based security mechanism for safeguarding enterprise
    architectures from potential threats. By harnessing the synergies between ML and
    IoT, organizations can unlock new opportunities for creating more efficient, secure,
    and adaptive enterprise ecosystems. In the future, we plan to design and implement
    an ML-based Intrusion Prevention and Detection System (IPS/IDS) for Industrial
    IoT systems. CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors have no conflict of interest

    The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ecosystem faces increased risks and vulnerabilities
    due to adopting Industry 4.0 standards. Integrating data from various places and
    converging several systems have heightened the need for robust security measures
    beyond fundamental connection encryption. However, it is difficult to provide
    adequate security due to the IIoT ecosystem’s distributed hardware and software.
    The most effective countermeasures must be suggested together with the crucial
    vulnerabilities, linked threats, and hazards in order to protect industrial equipment
    and ensure the secure functioning of IIoT systems. This paper presents a thorough
    analysis of events that target IIoT systems to alleviate such concerns. It also
    offers a comprehensive analysis of the responses that have been advanced in the
    most recent research. This article examines several kinds of attacks and the possible
    consequences to understand the security landscape in the IIoT area. Additionally,
    we aim to encourage the development of effective defenses that will lessen the
    hazards detected and secure the privacy, accessibility, and reliability of IIoT
    systems. It is important to note that we examine the issues and solutions related
    to IIoT security using the most recent findings from research and the literature
    on this subject. This study organizes and evaluates recent research to provide
    significant insight into the present security situation in IIoT systems. Ultimately,
    we provide outlines for future research and projects in this field. Keywords:

    widespread adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has revolutionized
    industrial environments, enabling enhanced efficiency, automation, and data-driven
    decision making. However, this rapid integration also exposes these systems to
    an increased risk of cyber threats and attacks. This article, “A Comprehensive
    Survey of Cybersecurity Threats, Attacks, and Effective Countermeasures in Industrial
    Internet of Things”, addresses the critical issue of IIoT security. It comprehensively
    analyzes various attack vectors that target industrial systems while proposing
    effective countermeasures to mitigate these risks. By thoroughly examining the
    evolving threat landscape and identifying potential vulnerabilities, this study
    serves as a valuable resource for organizations aiming to protect their critical
    infrastructure and ensure the secure operation of their IIoT networks. Cyber-physical
    infrastructures serve as vital elements inside these partially structured facilities
    if intelligent factories, as described by the industry 4.0 standards [1], have
    to maximize their manufacturing cycle. Their job entails monitoring and managing
    natural processes while making independent, decentralized decisions. The operational
    network of the IIoT is crucial since it makes it possible for logical systems
    to collaborate and communicate instantaneously. Thus, it is possible to execute
    the administrative services, operational procedures, and creative manufacturing
    solutions required for the smooth completion of the production chain [2]. This
    “IIoT” refers to an extensive collection of linked sensors, tools, and gadgets
    that, once incorporated into industrial sectors like manufacturing and energy
    management, produce a high-tech architecture of services. Figure 1 [3] illustrates
    how this interrelated structure makes it possible to deploy automation at an advanced
    level, reducing costs and increasing manufacturing procedure productivity. Figure
    1. Generalized architecture of Industrial Internet of Things systems. The interconnectedness
    of the IIoT enables seamless data collection, analysis, and exchange, thereby
    facilitating the optimization of production chain performance. This enhanced connectivity
    also opens up new possibilities for the industrial sector, allowing the realization
    of previously impractical operations and driving significant innovation and progress
    in the industry. The constant and seamless interchange of information across all
    production stages is essential for successfully transforming the supply chain
    into a fully automated operation powered by the IIoT. Utilizing a tiered architecture
    inside IIoT systems is frequently required to achieve this level of connectivity.
    Physical elements, including sensors, actuators, control systems, and security
    methods, are considered at the hardware level. The physical networking medium,
    such as cable and wireless technologies, are included at the network level. Finally,
    the architecture’s upper levels contain protocols that gather and send data throughout
    the communication stack, ensuring efficient and dependable data transport. The
    requirement to defend critical industrial systems from cybersecurity threats is
    highlighted by the growing interconnectedness and adoption of standard communication
    protocols, as outlined in the Industry 4.0 specifications [4]. Factory automation
    systems (ICSs), which manage the manufacturing process and the functioning of
    intelligent factories, constantly have access to critical corporate data in addition
    to the internet and industrial networks [5]. Sensors employed in control loops
    for data collecting and process automation are two typical examples of such systems
    [6]. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems (SCADA) are another example
    of the same environment. The IIoT network’s interconnected technologies allow
    for the remote monitoring and control of processes from any location. While connectivity
    and networking improve operational effectiveness, they also pose severe problems
    to infrastructure security [7]. Considerations for privacy, reliability, and accessibility
    become critical. Moreover, the initial design focus of industrial machines and
    devices is functionality rather than security, rendering them particularly vulnerable
    to cyberattacks. Exploiting flaws in commonly used Industrial IoT communication
    protocols, as well as inadequacies in their management of operations and consumption,
    can result in the compromising of crucial devices, the denial of vital functions,
    and possibly the total or partial demise of those items, with likely disastrous
    results [8]. Although several studies have explored security risks in IoT systems
    in general, there is currently limited extensive research specifically focused
    on the Industrial IoT environment. In addition, the seriousness of assaults and
    the hazards that accompany them, which can cause substantial harm and even fatalities,
    are frequently not appropriately highlighted in current studies. By undertaking
    a thorough analysis of popular attack techniques used in industrial applications
    and researching pertinent literature, this essay seeks to fill the following gaps.
    The objective is to promote a resilient industrial environment and provide a more
    efficient, cybersecurity-focused strategy. This study’s main contribution is to
    offer a thorough analysis of security hazards to manufacturing machinery and the
    most recent solutions to protect the infrastructure for researchers and organizations
    working with Industrial IoT technologies. It addresses these structures’ essential
    qualities and shortcomings and thoroughly analyzes all potential solutions to
    overcome the vulnerabilities, as recommended in recent research. The supplied
    evaluation and analytic paradigm set this research effort apart from other IIoT
    studies. It provides a thorough, current, and reliable standard for detecting
    and evaluating risks in the constantly changing workplace. This article offers
    a comprehensive analysis of the countermeasures that have been advanced in the
    most recent research articles. We examine many types of attacks and their possible
    consequences to understand the security landscape in the IIoT area. This study
    is organized as follows: While Section 3 thoroughly explains the significant dangers
    in the Industrial IoT ecosystem, the second part reviews relevant studies. The
    next part additionally looks at how these risks operate and discusses practical
    fixes suggested in recent studies. The main conclusions regarding our investigation
    are presented in the fourth part. The last part summarizes the research and highlights
    potential directions for further investigation. 2. Related Literature This part
    analyzes research studies that concentrate on the risks posed by Industrial IoT
    systems. The critical security threats are covered, as well as potential solutions.
    The contributions of these works are also examined, and issues that need additional
    research and study are noted. Many contemporary attacks and threats on critical
    infrastructure networks, such as power grids [9], exploit specific control systems
    like SCADA devices or compromise actuators or sensors in the physical layers of
    the network or attack links between devices in the data-link layer. Industrial
    automation control and telemetry systems depend on SCADA products, which use local
    controllers to connect to an Industrial IoT network. Contemporary cyber assaults
    [10,11] frequently use tactics to disconnect actuators or sensors, enabling the
    manipulation of sensor readings and changing how cyber-physical structures function
    in industrial settings. For example, cyber-attacks on a SCADA water supply and
    decontamination plant might cause crucial operations, including water treatment
    and production, flow meters, level and conductivity analysis, pH analysis, and
    chemical dosing pumps, to be compromised. Such assaults may have grave effects
    on public health. One specific paper skips over a detailed analysis of assaults
    on the physical layer and only lists the parts of a viable SCADA system. The paper’s
    authors address five attack types and attack vectors, including the use of cross-site
    scripting (XSS), overflowing buffers, injection of SQL queries, and source code
    design and implementation. However, they do not offer detailed explanations or
    methodological approaches for mitigation or prevention. Moreover, the study fails
    to provide substantial insights into attacks on the software 4.7 or raise awareness
    about the severity of attacks against SCADA systems, which can result in substantial
    destruction and human casualties. In comparison, [8] presents a more thorough
    strategy for tackling vulnerabilities connected to Industrial IoT systems. The
    Industrial IoT’s functional levels classify the first three probable attacks as
    operational technology (OT), and the final two are classified as information technology
    (IT) in Table 1 by the authors. The first functional layer covers the physical
    IIoT processes involving embedded devices, sensors, actuators, transmitters, and
    motors. Attacks at this level demand in-depth familiarity with the IIoT system
    architecture, access to device specifications and engineering blueprints, and
    a comprehensive understanding of installation and operational functioning. The
    second functional layer consists of specialized hardware, such as distributed
    control systems (DCSs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and gateways, facilitating
    communication and control between components in the first functional layer. This
    assault aims to influence the information flow and obstruct appropriate communication
    between the two layers. The third functionality stage consists of IP-based data
    acquisition devices, master stations, human–machine interfaces, SCADA systems,
    and relevant industrial automation control and surveillance systems. Many SCADA-level
    attacks use IP packet manipulation techniques to conceal the sender’s identity
    by faking attributes like the source address. Thanks to this alteration, the recipient
    is duped into thinking the packet came from an authorized network user. Business
    planning services, including office applications, intranet, web, and mail services,
    are included in the fourth level of service. Threats at this stage use known or
    unidentified weaknesses in the attacked services. Table 1. Layered IIoT architecture
    and possible attacks. Many tools like analysis, information extraction techniques
    used by enterprise applications, and cloud computing services are all included
    in the fifth level of functionality within the IIoT framework. Attacks at this
    level can take a variety of forms, including confrontational assaults as well
    as complex ones like surveillance and manipulation. A demilitarized zone between
    levels three and four, which includes service servers accessed by users from unknown
    networks, is introduced by the authors of the cited paper. It is essential to
    note. Even while the study provides insightful information about how the IIoT
    operates and the risks connected to it, its absence of particular instances of
    related attacks or preventative measures makes it insufficient. Instead, it acts
    as an overview of recognized attack types, including little data beyond what are
    already available in the existing literature. Manuscript [17] presents a thorough
    framework for IIoT security based on standardized and commercial design. In a
    three-tier design, the study looks at the security needs for industrial connection
    and communication protocols and evaluates the type of safety these standards offer
    at each layer. The study starts by outlining a three-tier, generic IIoT architecture,
    which effectively classifies the core elements of most IIoT advances, as depicted
    in Figure 2. The edge tier comprises endpoints and edge-based gateway devices
    that interconnect actuators, control systems, and sensor equipment in a vicinity
    connection. Gateway units act as aggregating indications, allowing layered connections
    with the upper structure tier alongside internal inter-level connectivity. The
    system layer leverages web or mobile network connections as a conduit for data
    and control exchange between the various levels. It includes software 4.7 and
    services applications for integrating data, transforming data, and analyses. The
    third and highest level’s link with the organizational tier is formed via an intranet
    infrastructure driven mainly by the World Wide Web. The corporate tier provides
    specialized protocols for customer interface and enables suitable offers, including
    specialized apps for enterprise, domain services, and hosting cloud computing.
    Gebremichael et al. offer a set of interconnection procedures appropriate to each
    tier and explain the security characteristics of secure device implementation
    in IIoT networks based on this architectural framework. These deployment solutions
    improve the security posture by dispersing security needs across various network
    regions and building backup protection in widespread attacks. Figure 2. Three-Tier
    Architectural Model for IIoT Connectivity and Communication Standards. Lastly,
    researchers [18] have given a thorough analysis of SCADA attacks. The primary
    hardware of the IIoT ecosystem, SCADA devices, are employed to track different
    industrial processes. They are made up of several entities that are arranged in
    a tiered framework. They include methods for integrating human–machine interfaces
    (HMIs), data transmission, and data collecting systems. An HMI is an operator
    contact that links a human to a device and is mainly used for displaying information,
    tracking operation time, and viewing machine input and output data. The master
    station unit or master terminal unit (MSU/MTU) operates as the principal control
    facility for a SCADA network, while the sub-MSU/sub-MTU functions as an auxiliary
    control site. The most frequent assaults on SCADA systems, their occurrence patterns,
    and the techniques typically employed are listed in this paper. The ensuing modes
    of attack are discussed in further detail. Intercepting communications on a wired
    or wireless network [19] between master terminal units (MTUs), sub-MTUs, or remote
    terminal units (RTUs) is known as passive or active monitoring. To exploit the
    collected data, an attacker with network access can install malware [20]. A man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attack [21] is when an individual observes and intercepts network traffic
    to modify and deliver data to the intended recipient [22,23]. When a breach is
    successful, the attacker seizes control of the session and keeps the connection
    going while using a fake IP address to evade detection [24,25]. Masquerading assaults
    happen when a hacker adopts an alias and uses a fake IP address to pretend to
    be an authorized network client to take data from the system or network [26,27].
    Brute force attacks may use stolen credentials to access critical data without
    authorization [28]. After conducting MitM or hybrid assaults, intruders may use
    infectious agents, Trojan horses, or worms [29,30,31]. Unauthorized people may
    gain access to the compromised system through malicious code, maybe exploiting
    it to launch more attacks on other infrastructure. Alternatively, the code may
    infect more MSUs/MTUs across the network, leading to unstable behavior or system
    failure [32,33]. Rogue RTUs overwhelm the MTU with arbitrary IP addresses during
    denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) threats, draining
    the framework’s resources and making it unusable [1,34,35,36,37,38,39]. These
    threats make use of internet packet-based fragmentation flaws. The MSU/MTU is
    unable to manage data transmissions that are larger than the maximum transmission
    unit size, which results in a loss of connectivity and system breakdown [3,40,41,42].
    A Cinderella-like attack happens when an evil individual modifies the system’s
    intrinsic schedule after gaining unauthorized access to a machine. The computer
    system’s vulnerability is increased by this early expiration of security software
    4.7 [43,44]. Doorknob rattling entails preparations, including legal methods for
    system testing. To assess the readiness and responsiveness of security measures,
    for instance, a small number of efforts to enter the network using randomized
    criteria are attempted [45,46]. Given the wide variety of systems with SCADA structures
    and associated designs, Ghosh and S. Sampalli performed thorough research on standards
    of current security (IEEE 1402, ISO 17799, ISO 15408, NERC security guidelines,
    NERC 1200, API 1164), detection mechanisms for SCADA (comprising some machine
    learning (ML)-based models like the Bayes algorithm, probabilistic forests, and
    choice trees), and avoiding a SCADA system assault. Adapting key management protocols
    like cryptography (SCADA Key Establishment (SKE), SCADA Key Management Architecture
    (SKMA)), and logical key hierarchy (LKH) are among the prevention techniques.

    with Countermeasures Remote administration and robotics can now improve the efficiency
    and caliber of services in critical infrastructures [47]. However, accuracy, dependability,
    and safety are of the utmost significance to effectively administer IIoT systems.
    Although the IIoT ecosystem incorporates digital technologies to increase efficiency,
    these technologies also present substantial hurdles because of the ongoing threats
    to digital security [48]. As a result, defending crucial national infrastructure,
    such as information technology, water and electricity networks, and public utilities,
    has come to be related to preserving the IIoT. These devices are excellent targets
    for extensive assaults since they are directly connected to the IIoT ecosystem.
    We divide IIoT risks into five broad categories in the following provisions: attacks
    involving phishing, ransomware infections, protocol assaults, supply chain attacks,
    and system attacks [49]. This categorization makes it easier to communicate security
    concerns thoroughly and comprehensively, along with the related solutions that
    are especially suitable for the Industrial Internet of Things environment. 3.1.
    Attacks by Phishers Phishing attacks are a popular technique for collecting critical
    data from customers. In this kind of assault, the perpetrator assumes the identity
    of a trustworthy organization [50] and tricks people into disclosing personal
    information on phoney websites or via infected attachments. This might lead to
    the installation of malware or the unintentional revealing of private data. Specialized
    phishers deploy sophisticated methods known as compromised assaults on critical
    infrastructures, which combine social engineering techniques with the exploitation
    of lax user awareness and the absence of active security mechanisms in systems.
    These methods could include website forgeries, logo obfuscation, link manipulation,
    filter evasion, covert redirects, and zero-day spyware. The primary targets are
    often vendor or remote websites, aiming to breach IIoT systems and gain control
    over their linked operational systems. Having a final objective of breaking IIoT
    networks and gaining control over operational systems connected to them, the primary
    targets are frequently vendors or distant services. The front-office stage usually
    occurs when a hacker tries to enter or use the IIoT. Analysts trace the system
    during the investigation phase, look for weaknesses, and decide when an extensive
    attack would be most effective. Pivoting, which is the act of switching from one
    system to another to apply the necessary exploits and compromise Industrial Control
    Systems (ICSs), may be involved. The problem of malicious website crawling employing
    specific techniques has been covered in several studies. A brand-new method named
    PHONEY, presented by Madhusudhanan et al. [51], allows for automated detection
    and analysis of phishing attacks. A web browser extension that informs users about
    the caliber of websites, their security certificates, and whether they have been
    found to contain dangerous code or misleading URLs is the basic idea behind PHONEY.
    Figure 3 depicts PHONEY’s entire structure. Figure 3. PHONEY Architecture’s Block
    Diagram [51]. Using PHONEY tokens, the article [52] provided an innovative technique
    for spotting website phishing material. In the paper [53], authors devised a technique
    for ranking, detecting, and phishing sites based on association rules and categorization,
    creating correlations between objects and association criteria. In the sense of
    precision, their approach outperformed more sophisticated standardizations like
    the SVM algorithm. The authors in [54] built a prototype web browser as an agent
    for processing data from phishing attacks, enabling users to access emails securely
    and receive alerts if an attack is discovered. The Intelligence Web Application
    Firewall (IWAF), an automated active security tool for identifying phishing assaults
    in crucial infrastructure, is a cutting-edge ML technique suggested by [55]. To
    improve the ability of critical infrastructure to respond, IWAF uses an updating
    Izhikevich spiking neuron model to recognize phishing websites and convert the
    information into firewall rules. The Industrial IoT device network traffic is
    parsed for features of interest, and the Izhikevich spiking model algorithm classifies
    and recognizes phishing assaults. Creating and converting indicators of compromise
    (IoCs) into group policy objects (GPOs), which are then applied to Windows Active
    Directory, establishes rules to stop and restrict phishing assaults. The URL Encoding
    (UE) technique, which analyzes relationships between various domain names and
    computes correlation coefficients among URLs, was first described in the publication
    [56]. The technique entails utilizing a network of neural networks to translate
    dispersed visualizations of URLs and then storing the mapping to handle spatial
    complexity. The authors suggest using clever machine-learning techniques to recognize
    malicious website addresses in DNS queries before they are executed. By mapping
    a sequence model based on extracting URLs from spam emails, the publication authors
    [57] created a method for identifying botnets. In [58], writers investigated various
    machine-learning techniques for categorizing websites according to their features
    and content. They used information, including IP addresses, WHOIS records, and
    lexical characteristics of phishing URLs, to filter emails connected to phishing
    and identify questionable domain registrations in the paper [59]. By building
    regular signatures based on expressions from a set of spam address data, Xie et
    al. [60] concentrated on identifying spamming botnets. By examining DNS queries,
    including multiple addresses (As) and NS records, IP ranges, time-to-leave (TTL),
    and alphanumeric characters from domains, the author developed a method [61] for
    identifying and reducing botnet infection. Furthermore, the study suggested by
    [55] presents a ground-breaking defense mechanism against fast-flux botnets, which
    use domains created using the domain generation algorithm (DGA) method. The system
    builds a Smart URL Filter within a zone-based policy firewall to find harmful
    domain names generated by algorithms. The third and most sophisticated generation
    of neural networks, also known as the evolving spiking neural network (eSNN),
    which mimics how the human brain operates, is used in this system. Comparing it
    to other developing and bio-inspired learning techniques, the suggested method
    showed improved prediction accuracy and generalization to fresh data. 3.2. Attacks
    by Ransomware In this form of attack, malware is introduced into the IIoT system
    to cause a denial of service (DoS) or access to private files, and the users are
    then required to pay a fee to regain access. Unlike traditional ransomware, which
    is generally disseminated, IIoT ransomware is typically targeted, i.e., it focuses
    on essential system components to cause as much harm as possible. Due to this
    restriction, IIoT ransomware research cannot be considered transferable to conventional
    ransomware. The authors of [62] present a comprehensive and methodical examination
    of the hazards posed by IIoT ransomware and offer some viable suggestions for
    remedies. According to their findings, IIoT edge gateways are particularly susceptible
    to ransomware assaults in IIoT networks. The IIoT gateways have some features
    in an industrial setting, despite different variations in their working as well
    as architecture. In a typical IIoT edge gateway, input/output (I/O) or program
    logic controller (PLC) devices act as a conduit between the outside globe and
    crucial IIoT infrastructure. The attacker can take complete control of an IIoT
    gateway after successfully attacking it with ransomware by changing its password
    and then replacing the current firmware with malicious code. Although the individual
    succeeds in reaching the surroundings of locking, the hacker is still capable
    of encryption and accession of all customers and their data, including those achieved
    from the PLCs and input/output devices as well as those exchanged across the internet
    and the business. The attacker can then threaten to slowly remove the victim’s
    data in case of unpaid ransom or demand payment to gain access to the information.
    To assess the vulnerabilities in IIoT edge frameworks, M. Al-Hawawreh and colleagues
    constructed a functional testbed for an IIoT framework in compliance with the
    Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA), as depicted in Figure 4 [31].
    Figure 4. The Evaluation Platform (Testbed) for IIoT Systems. Their setup consists
    of three main elements: IIoT channels, input-output devices (like IoT actuators,
    controllers, and sensors), digital actors (such as maintenance personnel, email,
    and cloud servers for handling IoT data, and SCADA real-time monitoring devices).
    They employed Python code similar to the Erebus Linux Ransomware attack to execute
    proof-of-concept (PoC) ransomware attacks on this framework. This targeted ransomware
    attack affected various web services, databases, and multimedia files from a web
    hosting service [60]. Reference [63] description outlines the primary stages of
    the attack, which also include scanning for data and system files in specified
    directories of the IT/OT edge gateway, encrypting data and identifying original
    files, transmitting the pilfered data as an email attachment via Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP) to a fabricated email account, and notifying the user about the
    ransom demand. M. AlHawawreh and team collected and analyzed data related to system
    performance, such as CPU usage, memory load, I/O device utilization, and CPU processing
    demands, and compared these metrics to data collected when the system was malware-free.
    Their findings show that compared to a similar attack on a desktop, the targeted
    ransom attack on the IIoT edge gateway considerably increased system resource
    utilization and processing power. These findings led the authors to conclude that
    keeping an eye on kernel-related activity characteristics can serve as a valuable
    predictor of crypto-ransomware attacks on IIoT edge gateways. M. Al-Hawawreh advocated
    adopting advanced security measures to fortify IIoT architectures against such
    attacks. These measures include the implementation of Next-Generation Firewalls
    equipped with sophisticated traffic filtering capabilities, the deployment of
    monitoring solutions like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for prompt recognition
    of malicious activities, and the strategic segregation of the IIoT edge gateway
    by positioning it in a specially designated secure area. These precautionary steps
    aim to substantially improve the resilience of IIoT systems to threats of this
    nature. Numerous research studies have used machine and deep learning (DL) techniques
    in different domains alongside traditional methods [64,65,66,67]. For improving
    the detection of ransomware outbreaks to consistently detect Windows ransomware
    network attacks, the authors of [68] presented a detection model using dynamic
    ML approaches, specifically conversation-based network traffic features. Their
    tests showed that the feature database performed exceptionally well in accuracy.
    Two independent classifiers running concurrently at the packet and flow levels
    were used by the authors of [69] to create a network-based intrusion detection
    system to find Locky ransomware. The suggested methodology demonstrated high tracking
    efficiency and good detection precision for ransomware attacks. To minimize data
    dimensions and provide accurate activity visualizations, also suggested was a
    hybrid detection model that combines classical auto-encoding (CAE) [70] and variational
    auto-encoding (VAE) DL approaches [71]. A deep neural network (DNN) classifier
    was trained using a new vector created from extracted characteristics. The proposed
    approach performed the highest concerning detection rate (DR), false negative
    rate (FNR), and support vector machine (SVM) [72,73] efficiency when compared
    to other models, such as random forest [61], decision trees [68], logistic regression
    (LR), SVM, and DNN [73]. 3.3. Attacks on Protocols The OSI network framework for
    the Internet of Things (IoT) consists of five hierarchical layers: physical, data-link,
    network, transport, and application. In the context of IIoT devices, the first
    four layers often employ the same protocols utilized in conventional IoT systems,
    such as IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), IEEE 802.11 (commonly
    used by WiFi), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and UDP/TCP protocols. This analysis
    emphasizes the significance of the application layer, which is vital for IIoT
    solutions, and provides a summary of potential risks and countermeasures applicable
    to the foundational four layers. These six layers—application layer, transport
    layer, network later, adaptation layer, MAC layer as well as physical layer—constitute
    the OSI network’s tiered structure for IoT, as delineated in Table 2 [74]. Table
    2. Comparison of IoT Protocol Stack and TCP/IP Stack [69]. 3.3.1. Attacks on Physical
    and Data-Link Layers Numerous studies have focused on attacks targeting different
    layers of IoT systems and have proposed corresponding countermeasures [74,75,76,77].
    At the physical and data-link layers, denial-of-service (DoS) assaults are among
    the most prevalent dangers. In these assaults, rogue devices reduce the nodes’
    processing power to turn off the system. The most common techniques used in DoS
    assaults include jamming, collision, exhaustion, and unfairness [77]. While tinkering,
    DoS assaults include physically altering sensor nodes, such as wiring on the electrical
    board or joining cables and buzzing. DoS threats entail transmitting signals at
    the same frequency to interfere with conversation. Cross-layer security detection
    and a jammed area mapping model (JAM) are two surveillance technologies created
    to identify buzzing DoS attacks and decrease their consequences [75,76,77,78].
    Tampering risks in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and RFID sensor networks (RRSN)
    can be found and avoided by physical inspection or by using particular instruments.
    When a malicious device transmits data on the victim’s frequency, it launches
    an interference DoS assault that results in subsequent signal transmissions and
    crashes. A fatigue assault is when the collision attack continues until the targeted
    node’s energy resources are depleted [79]. Injustice assaults take advantage of
    the system’s decreased functionality brought on by fatigue threats for their advantage.
    Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is one method of protection versus buzzing
    and crash assaults [80,81]. Assaults on data transfer that target IoT systems’
    physical and data-link layers, such as packet sniffing and man-in-the-middle (MitM)
    attacks, are common. Data encryption technologies such as the asymmetric encryption
    standard (AES) in IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN networks [82], wired equivalent privacy
    (WEP), and WiFi Protected Access II (WPA2) in WiFi and LTE networks [83] are some
    of the countermeasures for these dangers. Encrypting data using technologies such
    as the asymmetric encryption standard (AES) in IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN networks
    [82], wiring equivalent private (WEP), and WiFi Protected Access II (WPA2) in
    WiFi and LTE networks [83] are some of the solutions for these risks. Numerous
    studies have discussed assaults on the layers and offer suitable defenses [74,75,76,77].
    Denial of service (DoS) assaults constitute one of the most prevalent dangers
    at the physical and data-link levels. This kind of threat causes the system to
    become unavailable by reducing the nodes’ processing power. The four most significant
    DoS attack techniques are jamming, collision, exhaustion, and unfairness [77].
    In contrast to node sensor manipulation, which involves physically taking control
    of the sensor node by connecting to the computer board or adding wires to the
    motherboard of the circuit, a DoS assault involves the attacker transmitting at
    the same frequencies to interfere with the transmitted signal. To identify jamming
    DoS attacks, the researchers of [75,76,77,78,79,80,81] propose a jamming area
    mapping model (JAM) that bypasses the crowded region of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN) by rerouting the packets to alternate channels. By physically inspecting
    the WSN with the naked eye or with specialized equipment, tampering hazards can
    be recognized and eliminated. When an attacker’s device begins transmitting messages
    on the target device’s frequency, collisions, and packet retransmissions result.
    This is known as an interference DoS assault. A fatigue attack is one in which
    the impact attack lasts until the intended node’s resources for energy run out
    [82]. If an exhaustion attack compromises a system’s capability to benefit hostile
    users, this is known as an injustice assault. Frequency-hopping spread spectrum
    (FHSS) technology is used for efficient protection versus jamming and crash attacks
    [83,84,85,86,87]. Information transportation assaults, such as sniffing of packets
    and man in the middle (MitM) attacks, are highly prevalent at both the physical
    and data-link levels of IoT systems involving wireless sensor networks (WSN) and
    RFID sensor networks (RRSN). Encrypting information technologies such as the asymmetric
    encryption standard (AES) in IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN systems [88,89,90], wired
    equivalent privacy (WEP), and WiFi Protected Access II (WPA2) in WiFi and LTE
    networks [91] are used as solutions against this kind of danger. 3.3.2. Attacks
    on Network Layer Routing and DoS attacks, transmission of data assaults, and threats
    on the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) are the most often seen threats at the
    network layer of IoT devices [75]. In routing attacks, the malicious device transmits
    the active signals to the incorrect routes, and in denial-of-service assaults
    (DoS), it overwhelms the network’s resources and clogs up data. Evacuation sorting,
    authorization, and control technologies, such as IoT-specific intrusion detection
    system (IDS) solutions like SVELTE, are efficient defenses against these attacks
    [92,93,94]. Information transfer threats impact data integrity and confidentiality.
    Datagrams Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is one of the condensed transport protocols
    that can be used as safeguards [89,90]. Work [85] discusses the dangers to the
    neighbor discovery protocol (NDP). This work thoroughly overviews the operation
    and the most frequent assaults against NDP. This article also includes a complete
    analysis of tunneling (IPSec) and secure neighbor discovery (SEND) procedures,
    two NDP security techniques. The study results show that SEND is a highly effective
    defense against DNP protocol attacks for NDP, although most operating systems
    still do not provide enough assistance. Common risks to IoT devices at their network
    layer involve DoS and router assaults, assaults on data transport, and attacks
    on the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) [70]. Routing assaults include illegal
    devices passing active data to the wrong pathways, whereas DoS attacks overwhelm
    the network’s resources and generate traffic congestion. Egress filtering, authorization,
    and monitoring technologies like IoT-specific intrusion detection system (IDS)
    solutions like SVELTE are effective defenses against these threats [84]. Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS), among other condensed transfer procedures, can
    be used to reduce the impact of information transit assaults on data integrity
    and secrecy [77]. In [85], which additionally examines defense techniques, including
    tunneling (IPSec) and secure neighbor discovery (SEND) standards, the dangers
    to the NDP are detailed in detail. Deliver is the most effective defense against
    NDP assaults despite most operating systems failing to embrace it entirely. 3.3.3.
    Attacks on Transport Layer IoT systems’ transport layers are frequently targeted
    by attacks, including desynchronization, SYN flooding, and MQTT exploiting assaults
    [75]. Desynchronization threats interfere with terminal synchronization by inserting
    messages with fictitious command flag number sequences. A strong defense against
    desynchronization assaults is the authentication of messages [86,87,88]. SYN flooding
    attacks involve inundating the target with many SYN messages, which clogs the
    target’s queue and prevents it from processing valid SYN inquiries. By improving
    memory and queue management within the transport protocols and bolstering network
    security with packet screening and intermediary methods, SYN flooding assaults
    can be mitigated [84]. Work [85] lists the MQTT protocol’s shortcomings. Because
    it lacks built-in data encryption and authentication measures, the simple communication
    system MQTT, created for IoT applications with limited bandwidth, is open to assaults.
    Developing safe MQTT protocols that use attribute-based encryption (ABE) for scalable
    and reliable security is offensive against MQTT exploitation. An essential component
    of IoT applications, secure message delivery to numerous recipients, is supported
    by ABE [91]. Table 1 lists the most frequent protocol assaults in the IIoT, their
    hazards, and any suggested defenses. Desynchronization, SYNflooding, and message
    queue telemetry transport (MQTT) make assaults among the most common IoT vulnerabilities
    at the transport layer [95]. Desynchronization assaults cause destinations to
    become out of sync by injecting messages with fictitious control flag sequence
    numbers. Message authentication is a valuable countermeasure [96,97,98,99]. In
    SYN-flooding assaults, the malicious device floods the target with many SYN packets.
    The faked device does not send acknowledgments (ACKs) in response to the victim’s
    SYN-ACKs. Consequently, the target cannot receive valid requests for SYN because
    of a total backlog. To defend against SYN-flooding assaults, transport protocols
    must be modified and optimized. Memory and queue management must also be made
    to handle SYN packets more efficiently, and network security must be strengthened
    using packet filtering and proxy techniques [100,101,102]. The writers of [103]
    outline the shortcomings of the message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol.
    A simple communication protocol called MQTT is tailored for remote equipment management
    with bandwidth restrictions, such as IoT applications. MQTT modifies the publish-and-subscribe
    communication strategy. However, because MQTT does not, by design, include any
    confidentiality or identity method, it is highly susceptible to assaults. Implementing
    scalability and reliable safety methods, such as the safe MQTT procedure that
    upholds the attribute-based encryption (ABE) method’s security, is critical to
    protection against MQTT attacks. ABE offers broadcasting encoding, a preferred
    capability in IoT gadgets [104,105,106], and enables secure message delivery to
    multiple intended receivers. Table 3 provides a comprehensive overview of the
    most frequently encountered protocol attacks in IIoT, outlining the associated
    risks and suggested mitigation strategies. Table 3. General attacks in the primary
    four layers of the IoT stack and probable countermeasures. 3.3.4. Attacks on Application
    Layer Threats aimed at the SCADA protocol, frequently employed in SCADA networks,
    often target the application layer of IIoT systems. The writers of [107] focused
    on sensor assaults against loops of control for collecting SCADA infrastructure
    information, especially in gas pipelines and water tank storage implementations.
    The sensors themselves are PLCs (programmable logic controllers), acting as the
    operational devices in a network linked to provide remote monitoring and control
    of high-speed reaction processes, even across dispersed locations. The widely
    used SCADA Modbus messaging protocol that enables client–server connection over
    multiple bus or network types, generally via serial lines, makes it possible to
    communicate among these gadgets. In the operated computer simulation, the research’s
    attention was directed toward Modbus master’s gadgets, which provide queries for
    details to facilitate discrete or analog IO communication and data recording by
    the slave, Modbus. Every transaction uses a simple demand–response method in which
    the master gadget sends the request, and the agent device answers appropriately.
    After realizing several flaws in the Modbus protocol implementations, they continued
    to mimic those weaknesses in a monitored setting. They were able to perform this
    to document and assess the different kinds of attacks that might take place. The
    lack of identification of a fake slave–master IP address within the SCADA network
    is a flaw in Modbus technology. By submitting requests with the wrong IP addresses,
    an unauthorized remote intrusive can use this security hole to launch a man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) assault. An intruder can learn more about the MSUs and MTUs of the network
    by examining the emails that are delivered. An additional flaw results from insufficient
    safety measures and identity/certification inspections that jeopardize verifying
    the Modbus master and agent device connection. Using a Modbus master, this weakness
    permits outsiders to send random commands to any slave equipment without authenticating
    themselves. The SCADA Modbus system is also vulnerable to abuse due to development
    problems in handling request messages and separate input read responses. As a
    result, a remote attacker with malicious request or response parameters who targets
    susceptible Modbus programs can start a denial of service (DoS) or distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack on a SCADA network. Last, Modbus TCP is the most
    widely used protocol for process control in SCADA systems. To allow communication
    via a serial RS-485 interface, the protocol being used sets a size restriction
    of 253 bytes for the protocol data unit (PDU). The Modbus protocol header is extended
    by 7 bytes by Modbus TCP, significantly limiting the permitted package size. An
    attacker can take advantage of this restriction by crafting a custom packet with
    more than 260 bytes and sending it to a Modbus master-slave. A successful buffer
    overflow attack may occur if the devices are not correctly set up to reject such
    packets. Using systems to detect and prevent intrusions with deep packet inspection
    capabilities or industrial firewalls is a frequent countermeasure to reduce such
    security threats. Such networks are able to recognize as well as avoid exact threats
    that are concealed within the communication flow [108]. In this regard, Liang
    et al. suggest a multi-feature data clustering optimization model-based corporate
    system intrusion detection system that achieves a detection rate of 97.8% and
    reduces false positives by 8.8% [109]. An autonomous progressive neural network
    and the support vector machine are combined in Constantinides et al.’s novel network
    intrusion prevention system based on incremental ML frameworks and exhibit robust
    and scalable accomplishment appropriate for industrial uses as Table 4 shows the
    overall main threats with possible solutions in case of application layer protocols
    [110,111]. Table 4. Main security threats and required solutions in application
    layer protocols [110,111]. Modbus protocols, such as TCP design, also use ML-based
    intrusion detection techniques. A data preprocessing technique is presented by
    Deng et al. based on the frequency of coils and function codes for the Modbus
    protocol that are seen in Modbus TCP traffic. They used a support vector machine
    model to identify aberrant Modbus TCP traffic patterns [112]. In addition, intrusion
    detection and prevention technologies based on the cloud can potentially protect
    industry networks. An exact cloud-based design that makes use of software-defined
    networking, network function virtualization, and service function chaining is
    proposed by Brugman et al. This method uses a virtual private cloud hosted on
    Amazon Web Services to send messages to a public cloud for assessment, offering
    scalability, resilience, and visibility in identifying and preventing cybersecurity
    threats [108]. 3.4. Attacks by Supply-Chain Threats on supply chains carry a significant
    danger, particularly when the IIoT is integrated into the Industry 4.0 supply
    chain. In this way, cybersecurity presents a significant difficulty. Malicious
    code implanted within hardware chips can be highly evasive and run unnoticed for
    an extended time. Safety concerns result from the IIoT environment’s complexity
    and the involvement of several parties. The devices’ many parts are produced by
    numerous suppliers, assembled by another vendor, and then delivered by another
    party. This difficult-to-avoid circumstance frequently results in safety flaws,
    like installing backdoors that could endanger a whole manufacturing range, as
    depicted in Figure 5. Risk management has given more consideration to other parties’
    involvement in the supply chain. They [113] studied supply chain hazards and suggested
    methods for managing risk in their study. They offer perceptions of the IoT supply
    chain risk landscape, highlighting its extreme diversity. Figure 5. Meaningful
    connections among many participants in the IoT supply chain ecosystem [113]. Given
    the identical protocols and traits, the description of supply chain risks associated
    with IoT also applies to the Industrial IoT context. Vendors can insert viruses,
    backdoor channels, or defective chips into their products. Identifying and managing
    supply chain risks might be difficult since they grow and spread throughout the
    intricate IoT ecosystem. It is challenging to analyze how gadgets and vendors
    communicate. Therefore, addressing hazards calls for a supply-chain approach.
    A distributed system and a centralized, top-down approach are both suggested.
    Although this work helps readers comprehend the hazards associated with supply
    chains, it fails to suggest any concrete technological protections for environments
    already exposed to such dangers that are unwilling to change their comprehensive
    risk mitigation approach. A further contribution in the article [114,115] provides
    a dynamic and self-adapting supply chain system that AI, ML, and genuine expertise
    drive4. This strategy intends to create a blueprint for Industry 4.0 supply chains
    of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), who frequently do not have the assets
    to manage digital security risks successfully. Table 5 shows the research emphasizes
    the limitations of current methods for assessing the impact of cyber risk on supply
    chain infrastructure. Industry 4.0′s supply chain processes are poorly understood,
    which results in uneven measurements of supply chain security risks. Risk Analysis
    of IoT Supply chain Threats (RIoTS), a risk analysis technique for connected technologies
    like the Internet of Things, has been described in a separate paper [116]. Their
    strategy switches from focusing on vulnerabilities to modeling suppliers and components
    as a system. They suggest modifying attack tree approaches to consider vendor
    dangers and potential provider collaboration, exposing concealed dangers inside
    the IoT ecosystem. Numerous investigations primarily focus on supply chain attack
    risk prevention strategies. Table 5. The preventive measures of IIoT supply chain
    attacks [112,113,114,115,116]. 3.5. Attacks by Whole System Given their broad
    use and importance, attacks on SCADA systems are frequent in many industrial facilities
    worldwide. Addressing the security of SCADA systems is crucial due to the complexity
    and variety of these devices and their implementation in vital industries like
    water and energy. A detailed analysis of SCADA device attacks is provided in Reference
    [117], along with a particular solution for their prompt and efficient detection.
    The emphasis is on situations wherein assailants use a man-in-the-middle (MitM)
    assault on an Ethernet connections circle using the device’s root level ring (RLR)
    procedure, followed by a sneaky sensor threat, to exploit the fieldbus communication
    within the industrial EtherNet/IP protocol. A commercial computer network called
    Fieldbus is used for global control that operates in real-time and supports different
    network structures, including daisy-chain, stars, rings, branches, and trees.
    Gadgets use IO variables and communications that do not have particular formats
    and dimensions in fieldbus communication using the industrial EtherNet/IP protocol
    since the controller’s manufacturer decides these. 4–20 mA measurements are also
    used for encoding analog sensor command signals. Therefore, to understand the
    shared information and utilize the advantages of the instruments, a hacker needs
    a thorough understanding of the system’s architecture and access to device specs,
    engineering documents, and implementation designs. Utilizing multiplexed EtherNet/IP
    connections employing the User Datagram Protocol, also known as (UDP), sensors
    and control devices in the system are able to communicate wirelessly with one
    another. Multicast functions at the IP level, so all UDP messages with an identified
    target IP will be allowed, even though only gadgets adhering to a particular multicast
    address receive the multicast frames. Despite other datagrams inside the Class
    A to Class C address spaces, IPv4 multicast, which uses the Class D address space
    (224.0.0.0–239.255.255.255), does not guarantee accurate delivery of this data
    to the information receivers. Each address in the Class D address space designates
    a group of recipients interested in receiving the data via the IPv4 multicast
    data delivery method. A host can join a group by delivering a JOIN Internet Group
    Message Protocol (IGMP) message, enabling involvement with no time constraints
    or group ownership. Additionally, sending data to the group does not need a membership
    or the monitoring of transmitted data, making it extremely simple for an intrusive
    party to position itself as a man-in-the-middle (MItM). The assailant launches
    a covert sensor assault after determining the MItM placement. To change the behavior
    of specific processes without being detected by the system’s tracking devices,
    this assault requires changing the settings of the sensors and actuators. Think
    about an instance where an untreated water storage reservoir has a sensor to monitor
    the level of water, an opening that opens when the sensor detects a level below
    0.5 m and closes when the level exceeds 0.8 m, and a pump whose operation is based
    on the Ultrafiltration (UF) process, where pressure or concentration gradients
    enable separation through a semipermeable membrane. The safety system requires
    that the pump be promptly turned off if the water level in the tank drops below
    0.25 m. The intruder wants to change the depth of the water without being detected
    by traditional anomaly-based monitoring systems. In order to update the functioning
    of the gadgets in accordance, this is accomplished by creating the proper packets
    that modify the sensor and actuator information while still assuring compliance
    with the Fieldbus communication. F. Mercaldo et al. has created an intelligent
    and straightforward method using time logic and high-level capabilities unique
    to SCADA architecture. To describe the behavior of the SCADA system and assess
    its resilience to an assault, they simulate the system logs using a network of
    synchronous automata. Beginning with separating SCADA system logs from other logs.
    The procedure records values that correspond to real-world measurements made by
    network controllers. Then, those notable results are divided into three groups:
    high, baseline, and low. The data is supplied into an automated system that employs
    automata, which are mathematical constructs that preserve machines with abstract
    finite states that can be used to solve challenging issues. An automated system
    changes states based on the input symbol and the transition function. An automaton
    is implemented and synchronized with a particular clock for each discrete scenario.
    A status table displays the system statuses in a temporal format for every situation
    evolution. The machines are randomly checked to find excess or underflow. Any
    divergence from the status table that is discovered denotes a system threat. Although
    several clever methods are being put out for effectively examining web traffic
    among gadgets in the IIoT [118,119,120], particular standards are suggested in
    the paper “Blockchain Security Architecture for IIoT” [121]. This design, built
    on DL smart contracts, aims to improve the security and usefulness of industrial
    applications by giving SCADA equipment access to a decentralized, dependable peer-to-peer
    network. It closes a significant hole in the functionality of IIoT systems, especially
    regarding heterogeneous infrastructures built on blockchain. In order to perform
    sophisticated anomaly detection functions through smart contracts and enable secure
    network connection across trade devices within the system, the architecture uses
    the blockchain system’s characteristics. A complex deep automatic encoding is
    incorporated into the suggested deep neural network intelligent instrument’s code,
    providing a smart way to classify hazardous abnormalities in IIoT transactions,
    which frequently contain sophisticated cyberattacks. An auto-encoder is a coupled
    neural network architecture comprising an encoder and a decoder. Input data, such
    as network traffic between master and agent devices, is transformed into a compact
    and more dense representation known as a latent representation by the encoder
    network. The decoder network then reconstructs the original input using this hidden
    information. An automatic encoder’s job is to accurately recreate input data from
    a compressed and abstract representation it has learned. Using an autoencoder,
    the network can effectively compress the original data, filter out noise, and
    identify potential vulnerabilities associated with attacks in the SCADA Modbus
    protocol. Assault against industrial control systems, also known as ICS, frequently
    entails changing the programming language of programmable logic controller (PLC)
    devices or influencing the regulation of centrifuges to interfere with industrial
    machinery’s operation. The optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm, frequently employed
    in power plant controllers to find the best power systems management method while
    reducing expenditures and preserving the system’s safety, is maliciously applied
    in one attack scenario described in [122]. Power line power and the permitted
    generator frequency span, for example (59.5–21.1 Hz for a 60 Hz rated power grid
    in the US), are two factors that are generally subject to constraints. The PLC’s
    programmable logic controller (PLC) transmits control signals to sensors responsible
    for power generation, system security margins, on/off commands, and other functions.
    Luis et al. maliciously alters the PLC’s optimal power flow (OPF) control algorithm
    in this research. Three changes are made: the safety margin state is eliminated,
    the cost minimization algorithm is changed to increase the hostile impact, and
    hidden conditions are added to prevent operators and SCADA devices from detecting
    malicious behavior. Various anomaly detection strategies have been implemented
    to handle behavioral aberrations by attacks. Even when the type of assault is
    unresolved, such efforts are made to detect aberrations. This entails contrasting
    the framework’s performance as it currently stands with a model or a set of parameters
    that describe typical functioning [123,124]. Network factors like operating conditions
    and average electrical power throughout periods are taken into account by behavioral
    analysis. Heuristic evaluation is one of the further investigation techniques
    used to find trends and recognize irregularities with no set of unfounded alarms
    [125,126,127]. System behavior can be abnormal in many ways, including individual,
    situational, aggregate, and protocol abnormalities. These anomalies display behavior
    that differs from the anticipated patterns and can be classified according to
    their traits and consequences. A simple anomaly detection strategy may not be
    sufficient when extremely sophisticated threats occur, like those discussed by
    Luis et al. There is a need for more intricate and advanced techniques. However,
    [128] suggests a straightforward yet efficient system capable of precisely identifying
    sophisticated attacks. The Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm, which intuitively
    accumulates the difference between a variable and its predicted value over time,
    is the foundation of the technique. Change occurs when the cumulative amount rises
    above a specific threshold. Equation (1) is used by the CUSUM method to identify
    changes. Sn stands for the cumulative value at sample n, xn for the observed data
    at sampling n, and wn for the anticipated mean of the observed data in the formula.
    A change is identified whenever Sn rises beyond a predefined threshold based on
    the relative size of the change and the noise in x. S n +1 =max(0,  S n + x n
    − ω n ) (1) while S 0 =0, In the research run by Luis et al., the anomaly detection
    algorithm, based on the CUSUM approach, was successfully employed and validated
    for recognizing abnormalities. In this case, the algorithm continuously tracked
    the deterministic PLC control initiative’s execution duration and produced alerts
    whenever adjustments were found. The program was successful in spotting early
    anomalies frequently linked to assaults. It obtained exceptionally accurate stages,
    identifying the majority of irregularities in a matter of moments and up to five
    minutes in the event of a crisis. The quick discovery considerably reduces the
    assailants’ capacity to harm the equipment. Additionally, the methodology’s ease
    of use makes it appropriate for integration into PLCs with limited resources,
    serving as an essential security safeguard for the entire IIoT environment. In
    overall Section 3, the fundamental idea of comprehensive cybersecurity connects
    several security attack categories. Our evaluated work and the publications we
    cited most likely emphasize the need for a multifaceted approach to security that
    takes into account both specific modes of attack and an entity’s overall security
    posture. Furthermore, studies and actual examples are likely to highlight the
    value of ongoing surveillance, the exchange of threat intelligence, and teamwork
    among cybersecurity experts and businesses in order to recognize, hinder, and
    counter developing attacks. In conclusion, our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity
    encompass various attack vectors, recognizing that attackers often exploit vulnerabilities
    across different layers and parts of the system. It requires ongoing vigilance,
    adaptation, and a strategic blend of technical, organizational, and human-centric
    countermeasures to safeguard against diverse and evolving security threats. 4.
    Discussion The widespread use of infrastructure protection and the viability of
    the offered solutions should not be taken for granted, given that the cyber security
    of the IIoT ecosystem is a complex issue, as previously discussed [129]. The intricate
    nature of the components engaged in the IIoT and the broad spectrum of weaknesses
    that may arise from the visible major obstacles while referring to complicated
    patterns, systems, or processes that might not develop simultaneously over time
    and become possible shortcomings of the overall networks. [130]. For older, un-upgraded
    systems in the high-complexity environment under study, the complicated relationship
    descriptions and the minute distinctions that set them apart exhibit multivariate
    standardization systems while maintaining high heterogeneity [7]. The intricacy
    and secrecy of supply chain attacks, which make them difficult to combat effectively,
    have made them stand out among the other dangers as a considerable worry [131,132].
    Approaches to risk management are frequently used to lessen such attacks. However,
    the existence of older industrial systems not initially developed with security
    as a precondition is a significant problem. This weakness significantly increases
    the risk of assaults, even if access control or encryption methods are later included
    [133,134,135]. Additionally, there are serious issues about the mechanisms for
    standardizing and harmonizing with already-instituted norms. Due to the dependence
    of many existing IIoT systems on their development businesses, it is challenging
    to modify or adapt their mechanisms, including the functions they support [7].
    Due to its real-time operation and rapid evolution, the IIoT also encounters challenges
    in managing data with time discrepancies and considering correlations and interdependencies
    with other devices in the data flow sequence [98,100,105]. In manuscript [136],
    the authors investigated malicious attacks in underwater wireless sensor networks
    (UWSNs) by using a lightweight key management framework. An elliptic-curve-based
    algorithm was utilized for the key distribution, while a certificate-revocation-list-based
    algorithm was used for key revocation. This method provides high security with
    small amount of communication overhead compared to already existing methods. To
    ensure the security, reliability, and accuracy of the data, these factors introduce
    new requirements. Encryption [113] and critical management strategies have been
    proposed and implemented in the IIoT context, providing strong security standards.
    They are constrained, nevertheless, in their ability to create procedures that
    are rapid and simple to use, making them appropriate for usage in low-resource
    devices. One major conclusion of this research is that their ML methods depend
    on device or network traffic data [106,116]. In manuscript [137,138], a novel
    method is proposed to investigate as well as identify the anomalous behavior of
    attacks in IIoT technology, called the transformer-based method. This method has
    good performance compared to conventional ML methods as well as deep learning
    approaches based on accuracy, precision, and recall. There is an advanced and
    important framework called the reference technique. It was proposed with the purpose
    of providing security against different outsourcing flaws in the current era including
    side channels as well as state preparation flaws, which are created by mode dependencies
    and some attacks like Trojan horses and pulse correlations. In manuscript [131],
    the authors adopted the reference technique for proving the security of four-phase
    measurement device quantum key distribution (QKD) by using laser pulses to fight
    against potential attacks. One of the advanced security objectives of information
    is cryptography, which has subobjectives including confidentiality, non-repudiation,
    integrity, and authenticity. In manuscript [132], the authors proposed a highly
    efficient quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol that uses asymmetric quantum
    keys. The authors successfully completed the demonstration of the complete function
    of a quantum security network, which met all required objectives of information
    security. Although the learned parameters lack certain variables from different
    usage or behavioral elements in the overall design due to the limited methods,
    the smoothing is insignificant. The main problems originate from the inappropriate
    sharing of current statistics with all automatic internal looping updates, since
    it is mistakenly assumed that the original model and all of its updated replicates
    have similar feature distributions. As mentioned, a more effective method is to
    progressively save analyses in stages and read the optimization parameters for
    each internal loop. 5. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive description
    of attacks on Industrial IoT systems. It addresses these structures’ essential
    qualities and shortcomings and thoroughly analyzes all potential solutions to
    alleviate these vulnerabilities, as recommended in recent research. As a result,
    our attempt serves as an accurate framework for comparison and a valuable scientific
    instrument for identifying and assessing risks in the dynamic industrial environment.
    Its insights significantly improve IIoT security and could assist in developing
    effective defenses against risks posed by the Internet of Things to industrial
    infrastructures. When considering the future development of this study, one important
    topic to look at is the analysis of new attack vectors or complex attack tactics
    that combine fresh attacks, including zero-day attacks. IIoT systems must keep
    informed of new attack vectors and actively respond to threats. Another significant
    development in this research is expanding the analysis of strategies with self-improvement
    and self-adaptation abilities to handle particular and undiscovered threats in
    IIoT contexts. Artificial intelligence and machine-learning-driven solutions can
    increase IIoT systems’ resistance to shifting cyber threats. To ensure overall
    safety, looking into and evaluating additional protection measures designed especially
    for Industrial IoT systems would be helpful. Given the notable aspects of the
    IIoT, such as real-time operation, resource constraints, and various device types,
    customizable security solutions can offer more effective defenses against possible
    faults and attacks. By focusing on these research topics, the study could be expanded
    further and contribute to ongoing initiatives to improve the safety and resilience
    of Industrial IoT infrastructure in the face of emerging cyber threats. Future
    research can examine novel attack pathways and sophisticated attack strategies,
    such as zero-day assaults, to better understand the changing dangers to IIoT systems.
    Additionally, IIoT security can be strengthened against dynamic cyber threats
    by researching solutions that incorporate self-improvement and self-adaptation
    using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Given their distinctive qualities,
    such as real-time operation and resource limitations, Industrial IoT systems require
    specialized protective measures that must be carefully evaluated. Security systems
    that can be customized may provide stronger defenses. This study contributes to
    ongoing, existing initiatives targeted at bolstering the safety and resilience
    of Industrial IoT infrastructure in the face of rising cyber threats by delving
    into these research topics. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.I. and A.M.A.;

    Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that provides ubiquitous and massive connectivity.
    It promises an unlimited possibility in improving the quality of life (e.g., smart
    homes, intelligent diagnostics systems, autonomous driving vehicles, smart irrigation,
    smart cities, and many more) of end-user [1]. The IoT device is vast and encompasses
    numerous features at different layers, which can be challenging to understand
    the significance of different devices from different layers based on the type
    of problem it addresses. These problems are broadly classified as social, environmental,
    and economic development to transform an existing physical infrastructure into
    cyber–physical infrastructure. IoT has much potential to gather resources and
    assist individuals by offering efficient services with smart cyber–physical solutions.
    Smart healthcare, smart grid, smart water supply management, and smart city are
    IoT-based solutions that influence social factors. In connection to healthcare,
    lately, the Internet of Medical Things has emerged as a pioneering platform. [2].
    The authors of [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] investigated the smart healthcare
    framework to monitor the physical and mental health of the patients, and human
    activity recognition. This technology performs timely detection of an anomaly
    in an individual by collecting data using different types of sensors. To improve
    quality of life, we need to design an IoT network that facilitates access to essential
    services, transportation, and better environmental conditions. Thus a smart city
    application emerged by employing a network of smart devices. Examples of such
    applications include parking, waste management, sanitation, lighting, traffic,
    buildings, and the energy sector. Similarly, the smart energy industries solve
    the problem of generation, distribution, consumption, and demand analysis by integrating
    IoT devices. A few examples are smart wind turbines, smart hydro-power systems,
    smart grids, etc. In general, IoT also helps to enhance energy efficiency (EE)
    in electrical devices. Moreover, we use highways and roads to move consumable
    goods from one place to another. Therefore, the existing road infrastructure can
    be made smart by creating warning messages regarding weather conditions, road
    congestion, impending accidents, etc. Several emerging technologies empower smart
    applications like vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) data exchange service, device-to-device (D2D) connectivity [9]. These applications
    can be leveraged to solve the problem of fast and hassle-free parking and efficient
    traffic management through optimal routing mechanisms using different IoT sensors.
    Such sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.
    The literature in [10], [11], [12], [13] enables smart transportation in future
    cities by ensuring the safety of the driver and reducing traffic congestion. It
    is achieved by using the Mood-Fatigue Analyzer (MFA) and camera-based eye detection
    method that uses the viola-jones algorithm to ensure the safety of the driver
    and traveler in the car. In today’s era, the business prerequisites of the industry
    are automation, interconnection, and real-time data collection. Industrial IoT
    (IIoT) [14], [15] is the driving force of Industry 4.0. The enormous data generated
    by smart tracking systems [16], smart factories [17], and smart asset management
    [18] are exploited to achieve an optimized performance of the supply chain. These
    networks include embedded systems, microcontrollers, sensors and actuator networks
    (SANET), communication modules, etc. In [19], the authors have reviewed the motivation
    to apply IoT for big data analysis and the technological and social challenges
    associated with it. This type of application requires a continuous flow of information.
    Hence, the devices require more power compared to other applications. IoT-based
    cellular, non-terrestrial, and wide-area network connections are predicted to
    approach 5.9 billion by 2026 [20]. These wide-area network connections include
    sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and a communication interface that require
    batteries to run their sensing, processing, and transmission interfaces. These
    batteries have a finite capacity. Frequently recharging/changing these batteries
    results in change-over downtime and incurs huge operational costs. Moreover, at
    the current rate of carbon dioxide emissions, global temperatures have risen substantially
    from pre-industrial levels. Hence, there is a compelling need to plan future cities
    to be sustainable [21], [22]. Harvesting energy from natural sources is a promising
    self-sustainable solution that prolongs battery life, eliminates maintenance costs,
    and aids in long-term deployment. Particularly, photo-voltaic (PV) cells [23],
    [24] and radio frequency (RF) [25], [26] have been identified as cost-effective
    energy sources that enable on-site charging of rechargeable batteries for sustainable
    IoT applications. It is necessary to have a thorough understanding of IoT devices
    in terms of power, cost, and critical features (sensing interface, actuation interface,
    processing interface, data-storage interface, data-management interface, and communication
    interface) at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    However, no such architecture collaborates the function of three-layer, four-layer,
    five-layer, and seven-layer architecture design for sustainable IoT applications.
    So, there is a need to establish a clean and streamlined cross-layer architecture
    to bridge the gap between application requirements and IoT system design. The
    widely researched, self-sustainable IoT-enabled layered architecture design, compatible
    with various IoT applications, has been effectively illustrated in Fig. 1. In
    a self-sustainable layered architecture design, Fig. 1 represents every possible
    IoT service, device, and application congruously. The layered architectural design
    begins with the energy harvesting interface, which includes energy sources, transducers,
    trackers, and storage interface. Additionally, it demonstrates various optimization
    strategies to reap the maximum benefit of the harvested energy. Various IoT devices
    that require power to perform data sensing, transmission, processing, and accumulation
    at different layers, are presented. Next, the power consumption and cost of the
    device, associated with the functionality of a particular layer, are mentioned.
    Then, depending on the use of any device in the most suitable IoT application,
    the sensing, processing, transmission, and actuation interfaces of the layered
    architecture design are categorized in terms of power requirement, cost, and other
    critical factors. Finally, the business layer of the proposed framework is presented.

    Motivation and contribution Based on the state-of-art, we conclude that several
    studies have been conducted on EH-IoT networks (see Table 1), and a tutorial on
    EH-IoT networks based on the layered architecture design is missing. Moreover,
    no substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT
    device based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT
    reference layer models as shown in Fig. 1. For energy harvesting, it is necessary
    to have a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT
    devices. The framework involves generation process, storage mechanism, tracking
    energy consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed
    a framework for EH-IoT by dividing it into energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy trackers, energy management, and energy consumption interfaces. The proposed
    mapping of EH-IoT, along with the design framework, will help researchers and
    practitioners of this domain to reduce the time to collate knowledge and create
    a road map for their specific needs. The contributions of this survey are summarized
    as follows: • We have classified IoT modules based on their applications. Next,
    each class has been divided into IoT device based layered architecture to study
    layer-specific power requirements (or demand) versus the sources (or supply).
    • This is followed by a discussion on energy harvesting from several sources,
    which will act as an enabler of power source for EH-IoT. Also, the method to harvest
    and store that harvested energy is outlined by highlighting the currently available
    and emerging energy storage interfaces. • We proposed a balanced and well-researched
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device for various IoT applications.
    We developed a single overview of all layers’ architecture and their relations
    with energy harvesting interfaces. • The energy-saving and resource-optimization
    method for self-sustainable IoT design is discussed in terms of power and data
    optimization. Moreover, various methods to maintain balance among bandwidth, range,
    power consumption, and time constraints of IoT sensing, processing, and transmission
    interfaces are discussed by following a common framework of the EH interface.
    • Insights on IoT-based energy harvesting interfaces that contribute to interoperability
    and the interfacing units such as sensing, processing, communication, and energy
    harvesting are discussed in IoT layered design. • Finally, based on state-of-art
    literature, we highlight several open research issues and future possibilities
    for self-sustainable IoT device based on the layered architecture design. Table

    Table 1 indicates a complete summary of the existing survey papers based on different
    functionalities of devices. The functionalities of the device are shown based
    on different IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture design by considering
    their use in specific IoT applications. The different functionalities mainly incorporates
    the sensing & actuation, processing, EH, energy storage, data management and storage
    and wireless interfaces. 43% of the literature covers any four layers (mostly
    sensing and actuation, processing, EH, and wireless interface are covered under
    review). But most of the time these articles omit discussion on data management,
    and energy storage interfaces. We have covered all six interfaces. In contrast
    to the other surveys, our survey provides a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated
    overview of the proposed self-sustainable IoT device for diverse IoT applications.
    It is achieved by covering all the IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture
    design. Each interfacing region operates in the different layers of IoT device.
    The description of different interfaces is as follows: • The sensing and actuation
    interface is a part of the physical layer and deals with different sensing and
    actuating devices for IoT applications. Moreover, the processing interface is
    also a part of the physical layer, which focuses on the number of micro-controllers
    and microprocessors used in different IoT applications. • Once the data has been
    sensed and processed by sensing and processing interface of the physical layer
    architecture design, it needs to be sent among different devices for the exchange
    of information. This data transmission is carried out by a wireless interface
    unit which is a part of network layer in the IoT device based layer architecture
    design. • The data management and storage interface is part of the processing
    layer. It is responsible for handling and organizing large amounts of data. This
    interface also includes certain protocols used at the application layer, like
    MQTT, AMPQP, and XMPP, which are the methods used for managing the data at the
    remote server. • Finally, we need an energy-harvesting (EH) and energy storage
    interface to power the IoT devices. These interfacing units manage and store the
    power supply of IoT devices. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have a
    clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process, storage mechanism, tracking energy
    consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed a framework
    for self-sustainable IoT device by dividing it into energy source units, energy
    transducers, energy tracker units, energy management units, and energy consumption
    units. The proposed mapping of self-sustainable IoT device, along with the design
    framework, will help researchers and practitioners of this domain to reduce the
    time to collate knowledge and create a road map for their specific needs. Some
    of the available research papers based on the above interfacing layers are discussed
    below. In [27], the authors describe the overview of IoT in terms of wireless,
    sensing, and actuation interfaces by considering the middleware layer. This layer
    enables interoperability across various IoT devices, applications, and platforms.
    They define the suitability of the sensors, actuators, and different communication
    protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, and WiFi for IoT applications in a variety
    of applications, including healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. The authors
    of [28] described the cloud-centric/Internet-centric architecture for the IoT
    networking, sensing, and processing interface. The intention is to offer an integrated
    platform for developing analytics tools, computer graphic designers, specialists
    in artificial intelligence, and sensing service units. Therefore, a single platform
    can combine storage, computation, and visualization paradigms to improve IoT performance
    for various applications. Apart from this, authors in [29] focused on providing
    a promising approach to build a smart industrial system by using the four-layered
    architecture design. Authors in [30] focused on handling the security and privacy
    issue of the IoT paradigm at the perception and processing layers. IoT sensors
    generate massive data to make it applicable at the application interface. But
    unauthorized users generate several attacks, such as brute force, phishing, man-in-the-middle
    attack, spoofing, and denial of service attacks in the lower layers of IoT system
    design to steal valuable data. To address this issue, authors paved forward various
    technologies such as blockchain and physical layer security to secure the data.
    Authors in [31] discussed the state-of-the-art protocols and applications in the
    emerging era of IoT networks. They consolidate most IoT applications, including
    smart wearables, brain-sensing headphones, and embedded skin patches, by concentrating
    on the taxonomy of three- and five-layered architectural designs. The architecture
    section of this paper also considers fog computing, which has never been considered
    earlier but lacks a discussion on data management and power interfaces. Despite
    the advancement in IoT technology, work on sensing, processing, and actuation
    interfaces are still underway in terms of power requirement. To overcome the power
    interface units, authors in [32], [33] covered a thorough review of energy harvesting
    sources, energy storage devices, and associated topologies of energy harvesting
    systems for energy-constrained IoT networks. It mainly focused on distribution
    approaches, conversion modules, storage devices, and control units to minimize
    circuit losses. Similarly, authors in [1] examine several strategies that facilitate
    the efficient use of energy harvesting as a proxy for different IoT devices in
    an efficient manner. It also investigates the effective checkpointing and timestamping
    methods to power IoT devices without depending on conventional power supplies.
    In addition to utilizing renewable energy sources to power IoT devices, new machine
    learning and wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs are being researched.
    These include the backscatter communication technique, packet-less IoT communication,
    and reinforcement learning. The authors of [34] present energy harvesting solutions
    and energy efficient approaches for information and communication technology (ICT)
    by dividing the discussion of the paper into two parts: Green of ICT and Green
    by ICT. Green of ICTencompasses a wide range of topics, including green data center,
    network, and device approaches. Furthermore, Green by ICT provides energy harvesting
    strategies and resource-saving options for device-to-device communication. Further
    on, Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT) technology that increases battery life is also covered.
    A comprehensive analysis of the most recent energy harvesting technologies for
    IoT sensing devices is provided by the authors in [35], who also emphasize the
    IoT system’s potential for energy autonomy. In addition, the authors describe
    two case studies of IoT systems that utilize energy harvesting via solar and RF
    energy sources to provide energy autonomy for sensing devices. Both systems employ
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons as sensors, which broadcast the sensed parameters
    to BLE-capable terminals like mobile devices. The mobile devices then transmit
    this data to the cloud via internet services. The authors of [36] focus on the
    wireless interface of the current and future IoT applications, including 5G cellular
    networks, wide-area networks, and unlicensed band communication. It is accomplished
    by utilizing grant-free access, channel coding for short-packet communication,
    non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence to make the wireless
    unit energy-efficient, highly reliable, low latency, and scalable. In [37], the
    authors emphasized the data management unit by proposing a proportional trade-off
    between high security and reduced energy usage of IoT devices. It employs a context-aware
    technique to safeguard IoT data while consuming minimal energy. The authors also
    considered the scope of artificial intelligence and Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) to deploy a secure, energy-efficient IoT network. Similarly, in [38], [39],
    the authors presented different approaches to predictive analysis and classification
    methods to secure the data at minimal power consumption. It shows that during
    data transmission, most of the power is consumed when data packet collisions occur,
    packet overheads are unaddressed, redundant data is present, and a longer distance
    exists between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, they highlight a number
    of efficient ways to lower energy consumption in both single-hop and multi-hop
    communication networks. The existing studies involves shallow discussion on the
    interfacing units within the IoT context. However, it fails to provide detailed
    information about the specific types of sensing, processing, and communication
    devices involved, as well as their corresponding power consumption in the layer
    architecture design. From the state-of-art, it has been seen that there is no
    substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT device
    based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT reference
    layer models. As a result, our proposed framework filling the gap by mapping the
    IoT applications to the devices and, subsequently, the devices to the energy harvesting
    (EH) interface. The first step in this process involves identifying the layer
    architecture design for self-sustainable IoT device. Each layer accommodates different
    devices for different IoT applications. These IoT devices require a ubiquitous
    supply of power for their operations. To fulfill the power requirement of different
    devices that fall into different layers of IoT applications, there is a need for
    energy harvesting sources, transducers and storage interfaces. So, this necessitate
    the development of the self-sustainable IoT device that establish a connection
    among IoT application, devices and energy-harvesting interface. Download : Download

    architecture for IoT applications. Next in Section 3, the energy (power) requirement

    transducers, trackers, and storage approaches that can be used in various IoT
    applications are discussed. Next, in Section 5, the various optimization techniques
    for effective utilizing the harvested energy are presented. Then, in Section 6,
    a comprehensive surveys is highlighted for various IoT applications based on the
    devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces to establish
    the mapping between the IoT devices and the energy harvesting interfaces. Additionally,
    Section 7 discusses open issues and future trends. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in Section 8. 2. Standard layered architecture for IoT-enabled applications While
    designing an IoT system, it is essential to have an understanding of the devices
    and their organization. It is important to visualize the organization of different
    devices acting as a connected system. This Section describes the first step towards
    the strategic mapping between applications to layers and layers to devices. The
    designer has to take care of not only the functionality but also the coverage
    area, power requirements, architecture, and cost factors associated with the communication
    system. The standard functionalities are sensing, actuation, processing, data
    storage, and management. The cost factors include developmental, fabrication,
    and maintenance costs. This complex system model can be organized into a layered
    architecture. The design approach helps the system designer in two ways, namely,
    to create functional interactions and subsequently design communication strategies
    based on those interactions. In the first phase, the required functionalities
    are organized into different layers (e.g., starting from sensing any event to
    a final consumable product/application). The interfaces are laid down in the second
    phase to exchange information (intra and inter-layer communication). We have presented
    an example in Fig. 3. There are several position papers and surveys that deal
    with layer architecture design of IoT device [40], [41], [42]. Despite the refinement
    in IoT system design, the state-of-the-art has yet to have a single framework
    on layer architecture of IoT device that is widely accepted. While one group of
    researchers focused on the protocol, another group concentrated on the cloud-based
    architecture. In 2014, Rockwell Automation, Cisco, and IBM presented a seven-layer
    architectural model for IoT. However, the one proposed by the IoT world forum
    aimed to fulfill the space between application requirements and system design
    [43], [44]. The seven-layer architecture is an updated version of the five-layer
    architecture that introduced edge computing, fog computing, and big data processing.
    Fig. 3 depicts all the necessary functions and collaborative overview of several
    three-layer, four-layer, five-layer, and seven-layer architectural reference models.
    The role and requirements of each layer in the self-sustainable IoT devices, applications,
    and services is discussed in the following sections. In this work, the seven-layer
    interface has been consolidated into a five-layer architecture which is discussed
    below. A typical IoT application requirement can be connected to a self-sustainable
    system design by identifying the mapping between interfacing sub-layers [31].
    We shall use this layered architecture to review the power requirement of IoT
    devices. Next, we present a brief discussion on different layers covering the
    functionality, whereas an in-depth discussion on the IoT devices can be found
    in Section 3. Download : Download high-res image (753KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Different layer architecture designs for IoT device. 2.1. Business
    layer The main aim of the business layer is to handle the entire IoT system. It
    communicates with the application layer and consumes the information available
    at that layer. It can alter business operations and benefit the overall operation
    of the IoT network. 2.2. Application layer The application layer provides application-oriented
    services to the end users. A huge number of IoT applications have been developed
    that cater to different services such as smart home, smart transportation, smart
    infrastructure management, and many more sustainable IoT applications have been
    broadly categorized into three classes, namely, social, business and environmental.
    2.3. Processing layer This layer is referred to as the middleware layer, and it
    is responsible for storing, processing, and analyzing a large amount of information
    from the connectivity layer. It incorporates database management, cloud computing,
    and analytics of big data-based technologies. The processing layer encompasses
    two most important sub-layer interfaces that recreate a crucial part of IoT system
    design, e.g., (a) data storage/accumulation interface (b) data management/abstraction
    interface. 2.4. Connectivity layer The connectivity layer mainly deals with the
    transmission of useful information in an efficient and timely manner. The layer
    includes all networking elements of IoT. This layer includes wireless communication
    protocols such as Z-Wave, LoRa, Zigbee, Thread, Wi-Fi, SigFox, Bluetooth, and
    cellular communication. 2.5. Physical layer (Perception layer) The physical layer
    is the initial layer of the IoT reference model that deals with the things/devices
    of IoT. The “things” in IoT refers to different end devices that transmit and
    receive data. The layer includes sensors, actuators, and controllers. The power
    supply is also managed through this layer. Multiple interfacing sub-layers exist
    between the physical and connection layer (as depicted in Fig. 3), namely, the
    sensing and actuation interface, power supply/monitoring interface, pre-processing
    interface, and temporary storage interface. Moreover, a detailed discussion on
    sensors and actuators, which are part of the layer, is discussed in Section 3.5.1
    The following Section goes through the power, cost, and critical features of IoT
    devices at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    3. Power and cost required for self-sustainable IoT devices in the layer architecture
    design This Section discusses the power or voltage and the associated cost of
    operating different IoT layers. IoT devices’ power consumption is crucial in identifying
    suitable energy harvesting interfaces to make them sustainable. Moreover, different
    IoT devices consume power at different layers based on their functioning. However,
    business layers need not be mentioned in this Section, as this layer do not involve
    physical IoT devices that consume power. So, this layer mainly do not contribute
    towards the sustainable IoT device. Moreover, this layers deal with application-oriented
    services involving different groups and business processes. Above this, we look
    at the cost requirement and critical features of different types of microcontrollers,
    sensors and actuators network (SANET), and communication modules to make the architecture
    of IoT device self-sustainable in different smart applications as discussed below:
    3.1. Application layer The application layer protocols play a significant role
    in sustaining the IoT devices for different applications as it establishes the
    communication among things, devices, or objects with different application interfaces.
    Cloud-based communication protocols often improve connectivity rates to ensure
    stability, durability, and productivity through better information access. The
    most commonly used application layer protocols are Websocket, Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational
    State Transfer (RESTful Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS). These
    protocols can be employed in different IoT applications for sustainable operations
    to provide a strategic mapping between the application layer with other layers.
    Below we mention different communication protocols to link a connection between
    IoT devices and the cloud. • Advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP): It is an
    application layer protocol that facilitates client–server communications between
    cloud and IoT nodes. This open-access based protocol contains more message overheads
    and is not accepted widely [45]. • Message queue telemetry transport (MQTT): MQTT
    is a lightweight communication protocol based on publish–subscribe-based architecture
    [46], which allows the client device to subscribe to the broker for receiving
    data from the server (publisher) through the topic. In the existing literature,
    MQTT ensured the reliable reception of messages offering different quality of
    services (QoS) [47], [48], [49]. • Constrained application protocol (CoAP): It
    is a web communication protocol with constrained nodes and a restricted network.
    It also facilitates a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for smooth network integration.
    It mostly provides communication among machine-to-machine networks and uses the
    HTTP and publish–subscribe architecture with various commands. In comparison to
    the MQTT, the centralized device in CoAP uses a universal resource identifier
    (URI) [50]. In comparison to available protocols, MQTT offers better QoS, throughput,
    data protection, low latency [51], low packet loss [52], low power consumption
    and restricted bandwidth usage [53], [54]. The widely available cloud service
    providers are xively, grove stream, carriots, things worx, things speak, plotty,
    amazon web services (AWS), microsoft azure and many more. 3.2. Processing layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the different computing platforms that is responsible
    for making the decision based on the data sensed from the sensor and communicated
    to the central server for analysis, computation, and storage. The power consumption
    of the processing layer services is very high, and the cost requirement is moderate
    and varies from different service providers such as Xively, Grove Stream, Carriots,
    Plotty, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services, and many more. Based on the intense
    survey, it is noticed that there is no criteria for selecting these data processing
    services for particular IoT applications based on the IoT device requirement.
    The processing layer mainly incorporated the hierarchical computing platforms
    for the data operation, as discussed below: • Cloud computing: In a wide variety
    of IoT applications, storing, processing, and analyzing unstructured data in a
    well-manageable form is a significant challenge. Cloud services are the most common
    platform for monitoring, analyzing, and storing huge IoT data. However, as the
    number of IoT devices increases, processing a huge amount of data on a single-layer
    platform leads to network congestion and an increase in the loss of data packets.
    So processing data on a single layer for a longer interval is not feasible due
    to the high latency and limited bandwidth per user. As a result, Cloud-computing
    is considered as a non-optimal approach for distributed processing of IoT data
    generated by different sensors and other devices at lower layers. So, fog and
    edge computing came into existence to address this challenge and maintain highly
    responsive IoT applications with low latency [55]. • Fog computing: To overcome
    the challenges in cloud computing, it is suggested to distribute data processing
    across the middle region of the processing layer rather than directly sending
    data to the cloud service (final region of processing layer). This process, known
    as Fog computing, involves handling data as close to the connectivity layer. It
    will reduce the latency and network congestion to a larger extent [56]. Fog computing
    is considered to be the best as it may link to the nearby edge device for analyzing
    and transformation that are later supported by the cloud services for storage
    and processing. • Edge computing: Although the concept of Fog computing solves
    all the limitations of Cloud computing, the concept of Edge computing came into
    origination to further minimize the latency. The main aim of Edge computing is
    to bring a IoT device closer to the data processing, computation and accumulation
    layer rather than relying on the cloud server. So that it can preprocess data
    and only forward the metadata by reducing the bandwidth requirement per device.
    Fog and edge computing can be employed in various IoT applications, such as smart
    traffic systems to enable the warning system by generating real-time warnings
    using the edge service [57]. The smart metering system also uses fog, edge, and
    cloud services to analyze the energy consumption of different households, industries,
    hospitals, schools and many more. Such analysis generates more data and uses a
    larger bandwidth. To address this, a hierarchical fog service is proposed [44],
    [58] as a solution by interconnecting them with a different edge service employed
    on each meter to reduce latency. On the other hand latency-tolerant data may be
    sent directly to the cloud services platforms for processing and storage. Apart
    from this, it is also used in various other IoT applications, such as smart hospitals,
    smart homes, smart industries, smart cities, and many more [59], [60], [61] to
    process data with low latency and high responsiveness. 3.3. Connectivity layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the various types of wireless communication protocols
    for enables communication from the device-to-device and the device-to-access point.
    Additionally, the characteristics of a protocol in terms of its bandwidth, data
    rate, lifespan, and cost are provided. 3.3.1. Device to device/device to access
    point wireless protocol Communication via IoT devices involves data transfer from
    D2D and the device to the access point gateway. The IoT ecosystem incorporates
    billions of smart devices, but they have significant limitations e.g. processing
    speed, power, lifetime, and range. Since IoT devices mainly operate at low power,
    commercially available communication devices for device-device communication are
    Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), WiMAX, cellular, Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), Z-Wave, Zigbee,
    6LowPAN (IEEE 802.15.4), BLE 5.0 (IEEE 802.15.6), SigFox, LoRa, RFID, Near field
    communication (NFC), etc. Classification of these devices based on coverage area
    is shown in Fig. 4. A comparative study on the above-discussed communication protocols
    is presented in Table 2. In 2016, a new standard for energy harvesting was launched
    as ZigBee green power (GP) for wireless sensor networks [84]. The ZigBee GP specifications
    and the IEEE 802.15.4 networking protocol are used in energy-harvesting ZigBee-based
    communication protocol applications that operate on a low-power microcontroller
    framework [85]. IEEE 802.11ah is another framework that achieves a lower data
    rate but has a greater coverage area than traditional Wi-Fi operating above 1
    GHz. In this frequency range, absorption by buildings and other objects increases
    significantly. Hence, 802.11ah is an ideal candidate to be used for IoT networks.
    The analytical expression of throughput for IEEE 802.11ah has been obtained in
    [86]. Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download : Download full-size

    deals with a temporary and permanent memory device to store data. It also involves
    the collection and processing of data on virtual storage systems, such as cloud,
    fog, and edge, and how the data can be structured. The microcontroller board (temporary
    storage interface) can have two types of memory, i.e., volatile (RAM) and non-volatile
    (e.g., flash, EEPROM) memories. Volatile memory requires continuous power, while
    non-volatile memory requires power on demand. 3.5. Physical layer In this subsection,
    we discuss several types of sensing and actuating devices that are utilized in
    various IoT-based smart applications. The power utilization and the associated
    cost to fabricate each sensor are described in Table 3. The cost of sensors has
    been taken from amazon.com. The search keyword was “IoT sensors” and visited on
    5th January, . Sensors with the capability of harvesting energy can be reused.
    Thus the overall power consumed by the sensing system reduces significantly and,
    in effect, extends the operation time of an IoT device as discussed in [15], [87],
    [88], [89], [90], [91], [92]. In this Section, we examine different types of sensors
    and actuators and list out possible areas of application in connection to IoT
    system design. Table 3. Comparison of sensors employed in sustainable IoT designs.

    60 mA (AS), 2 mA (SS)/ V 18.99 3.5.1. Sensing interface A sensor is typically
    a device that senses or measures physical changes in the surrounding environment,
    such as thermistors, light-dependent resistors, magnetic field-based sensors.
    A response is created whenever there is any change in the physical or chemical
    state of objects in the vicinity of the sensor. This response is measured and
    analyzed by the sensors [93]. We specifically discuss a few sensors used for a
    particular IoT application. We also list out the associated parameters required
    to achieve specific design objectives. Velocity This type of sensor measures consecutive
    positions at known intervals and computes the rate at which the movable object
    position varies at different times. Based on the working principle, velocity sensors
    can be of two types, e.g., linear and angular. A linear sensor measures the rectilinear
    motion, and an angular sensor measures the spin rate of an entity. Examples of
    velocity sensors include doppler-effect sensors, accelerometers [11], and gyroscopes.
    Such sensors mainly find applications in smart vehicles, traffic monitoring systems,
    smart cities [93]. Proximity The proximity sensor detects the location of a neighboring
    object without making any physical contact [94]. It emits infrared waves and senses
    the presence of any object by measuring the difference of signal indicating return
    status [95]. Its use can be inductive, capacitive, ultrasonic, photoelectric,
    and magnetic [96]. Moreover, it is employed in several places to count the number
    of cars and objects in applications like smart parking and smart homes. Position
    The position sensor uses a motion detection mechanism to determine whether humans
    or other objects are within a specific region. Examples of position sensors are
    rotary encoders and hall effect sensors. This type of sensor is used in typical
    hospital surveillance systems that track patients, nurses, and doctors [97]. In
    [98], Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is also utilized to monitor the real-time location
    of people working in an underground mine. Temperature Temperature sensor calculates
    the heat intensity of a person to assess ambient conditions using non-contact-based
    or contact-based mechanisms. The contact-based sensor works when it is in physical
    touch with the object. However, the non-contact-based sensor measures the temperature
    using the convection and radiation method [99]. Typical examples of temperature
    sensors include thermocouples and thermistors. Such sensors are used in smart
    irrigation, smart healthcare, and environment monitoring [100]. Chemical Chemical
    sensors measure the chemical composition of the overall environment. It operates
    by detecting chemical reactions or a set of chemicals. Some examples of chemical
    sensors are breath analyzers, olfactometers, and smoke detectors. These sensors
    are typically employed in different IoT applications like smart cities, smart
    buildings, smart irrigation, air quality monitoring [101], etc. Force The Force
    sensor detects the amount of stress and converts it into an output signal. Examples
    of such a sensor include the strain gauge and pressure switch. These sensors are
    applied to numerous IoT applications, e.g., smart buildings, intelligent construction,
    medical monitoring [102], etc. Light The light sensor is a passive device that
    receives energy from light and transforms this energy into an electrical signal
    [103]. Hence an external power source is not needed in this case. Infrared sensors,
    photodetectors, and flame detectors are some of their examples. Biomolecular Biomolecular
    sensor translates metabolic reactions into electrical signals. These sensors monitor
    several biological factors, e.g., tissue, antigen, antibodies, hemoglobin level,
    glucose, and nucleic acid. Examples of such sensors are pulse oximeters, electrocardiographs,
    and various others that measure the physical and chemical changes in the human
    body. Humidity The humidity sensor first picks up the amount of water vapor in
    the air and then converts it into an equivalent electrical signal. The humidity
    level can be calculated in different ways, e.g., absolute, relative, and mass
    ratio. Hygrometer, soil moisture indicator, temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11),
    and so on are some of its examples. 3.5.2. Actuation interface An actuator is
    an element of a device that drives the system by converting the available energy
    into physical movement. An actuator needs a control signal and an energy source
    to operate. For IoT applications, actuators are mainly two types, i.e., continuous
    and binary actuators. A relay is an example of a binary actuation interface with
    two stable states, either latched (ON) or unlatched (OFF). Binary actuators consume
    full power or no power in the ON and OFF state, respectively. A motor is an example
    of a continuous actuator, as it can rotate through an angle of 360°. The speed
    and direction of a motor are governed by a microcontroller with pulse width modulation
    (PWM) signal pins. Next, we discuss the operation of some commonly used actuators.
    Servo motor A servo motor includes a direct current (DC) motor with two wires,
    a gear line, a potentiometer, an integrated microcontroller IC and a shaft (output
    spine). The shaft is mounted at a particular angular position by sending a control
    signal to the servo via a microcontroller. However, it can rotate up to 180° only.
    The servo motor consumes power only in position control mode. Servo motor is used
    in different IoT devices such as dual-axis solar panels (self-sustainable IoT),
    smart positioning, e.g., in an elevator (smart infrastructure), movement of a
    smart robot, computer numerical control (CNC) machine, and automatic production
    in smart industries. Relay The relay is a programmable electrical switch to energize
    (ON) or de-energize (OFF) devices that consume high voltage, current, or both.
    Hence it is an intermediate device that connects high-voltage devices and microcontrollers.
    It comes with two sets of pins. One set is used for a microcontroller or low-voltage
    device, and the other is used for a high-voltage device. Relays are part of most
    IoT applications to control the devices based on the controlling signals from
    interfaced microcontrollers. One of the examples is smart irrigation to energize
    and de-energize the water pump based on the controlling signals. Stepper motor
    The DC voltage drives a stepper motor, and it rotates in discrete steps. Such
    a motor consists of several coils organized in a group known as ‘phase’. Only
    a single series phase is energized at a time, and the motor rotates one step.
    Its rotating position, speed, acceleration, and deceleration can be precisely
    controlled. Like the servo motor, the stepper motor is not limited in rotation.
    It requires additional hardware and power supply to complete a single rotation.
    A stepper motor consumes power to lock in and remain in position command. Its
    application domain is limited to automation, robotics, 3-D printer, and X-Y plotter.
    Hydraulic actuator A hydraulic actuator consists of a fluid engine that utilizes
    hydraulic power to enable mechanical operation. The mechanical movement is then
    transformed into linear, rotating, or oscillatory motion. Its application domain
    is restricted to single-axis movement of any heavy load, braking system, heavy
    load lifting/balancing system, and radial engines DC motor DC motor is the most
    commonly used actuator in electronics projects. It is available in different sizes
    to handle various activities. It consists of permanent magnets and loops of wire.
    When the device is switched ON, the loops induce a magnetic field, which interacts
    against the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. Pneumatic actuator The pneumatic
    actuator transforms the energy shaped by vacuum or compressed air in linear or
    rotational movement at high pressure. It converts pressure into force. Pneumatic
    actuators can generate a large amount of force from relatively minor variations
    in pressure. 3.5.3. Processing interface In processing and controlling interface,
    we list out different types of microcontrollers boards. The widely used microcontrollers
    in this layer are Arduino UNO [104], Raspberry Pi [105], and NodeMCU ESP8266 [106].
    The microcontrollers along with their processing speed, operating voltage, characteristics
    and the cost are tabulated in Table 4. Depending on the energy consumed by a sensor
    node, the following operational states have been defined, namely, active state
    (AS), sleep state (SS), ultra low power active state (ULPAS), low power active
    state (LPAS) and low power state (LPS). The most commonly used processor is MSP432.
    There are typically four low power modes (LPM) in MSP432 processor. LPM 3, LPM
    4 refer to deep sleep states, while LPM 3.5 and LPM 4.5 refer to stop or shut
    down state. The operational, ADC states of a MSP432 processor along with the current
    rating and cost are depicted in Table 5. Table 4. Comparison among different microcontroller

    4. EH techniques: Different components required for self-sustainable IoT devices
    In this Section, commonly used sources of energy harvesting are discussed. Subsequently,
    EH transducers, standards and energy trackers are outlined. Next, we list the
    amount of power generated through harvesting, the cost of those harvesters, and
    the applications that utilize the effective harvested power. Frequent battery
    replacement in devices is a time-consuming and costly process, as it requires
    human intervention. Further, access to IoT devices is limited in remote locations.
    Additionally, many IoT devices are deployed in several IoT applications, making
    it difficult to run on battery throughout their life. To tackle these issues,
    harvesting energy is seen as a critical enabler technology that reduces dependence
    on batteries [35]. A battery life may be extended indefinitely subject to the
    fact that the converted electrical energy is more than the minimum energy requirement
    [107]. EH modules integrated with WSNs are referred to as energy-harvesting wireless
    sensor networks. These integrated modules collect energy by utilizing external
    sources, i.e., RF, solar, wind, vibration, and thermal. Since the harvested energy
    is stochastic and unstable, the transmission parameters of the WSN need dynamic
    adjustment to maintain a sustainable operation. The design methodology of energy-efficient
    IoT devices is explored in [108]. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have
    a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process (source, transducer, and converter),
    storage mechanism, and managing the supply of harvested energy. The proposed mapping
    of EH-IoT and design framework are shown in Fig. 5. It will help the researchers
    and practitioners to build a system for a specific use case. Next, we discuss
    the different interfaces of Fig. 5 one by one. Download : Download high-res image

    interfaces, BW refers to bandwidth. 4.1. EH sources WSN is the fundamental building
    block of IoT. Moreover, considering the duty cycle, the battery life of WSN is
    lessened to just a few days as nodes remain active most of the time. Hence, battery
    life plays a significant role in overall energy consumption. Energy harvesting
    sources can be categorized into external and ambient. Further categorization and
    examples of these sources are shown in Fig. 6. The ambient sources are accessible
    within the surrounding region of energy harvesting objects. These sources can
    either be static or dynamic in nature [21]. A static source provides a predictable
    energy level, while a dynamic source generates energy randomly or periodically.
    The external sources emit energy to the nearby surroundings, such that the devices
    can harvest from this emission. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download

    Light The photovoltaic (PV) effect is the standard method of extracting electrical
    energy from light sources. Based on the composition, PV cells are of the following
    type [91]: • Mono-crystalline: It offers 15%–24% efficiency, however, it is quite
    costly. • Poly-crystalline: This cell offers 14%–20.4% efficiency, and it is less
    costly as compared to the mono-crystalline one. • Thin-film: It is the cheapest
    cell and can absorb low-intensity light. However, it is less efficient 8%–13.2%.
    PV cells are commonly known as solar cells. Light energy can be harvested in the
    following IoT applications: environment monitoring, smart homes, and commercial
    buildings. There has been considerable research effort to power IoT networks using
    light energy in remote locations. The author in [109] employed an eco-sensing
    method that offers a wide range of light energy harvesting technology. It also
    shows that nodes in an IoT network react more to light energy than other sources,
    thus making the system highly efficient. To power a beacon node, the design methodology
    of a light-harvesting device is introduced in [110]. Similarly, in [111], a light-harvesting
    circuit has been proposed to provide sufficient power to the Bluetooth low-energy
    node. Although the aforementioned IoT network has good scope in terms of application,
    it cannot support an achievable information rate with high efficiency. In [112],
    a power controller is developed for a current-deprived voltage control oscillator
    (VCO). This controller generates a power of W, for a solar irradiance of lx. Light
    energy is stochastic and intermittent, which is very difficult to predict. So
    maintaining a continuous power flow using light energy requires adopting specific
    mechanisms or principles. The feedback principle is commonly employed in [112]
    to ensure a continuous power flow. For example, in [113], the authors achieved
    a continuous power flow with controlled voltage or current. An analytical connectivity
    model, a zero-energy IoT system, is proposed in [114], where the networking elements
    are solar-powered. Typically, at 25 °C ambient temperature, the solar panel can
    harvest about power. A solar panel has 15% conversion efficiency and converts
    the harvested power into 15 mW/cm2 power [115]. Only 70% of the harvested power
    is consumed at the PWM circuit’s output. The remaining harvested power leaks into
    the atmosphere. A cluster-based algorithm is proposed in [107], which enhances
    the utilization of harvested energy. Moreover, the different light intensity in
    indoor and outside environments results in different amount of harvested energy.
    The efficiency of harvested light in the indoor environment is of the one produced
    in the outdoor environment. Several authors have presented analytical and experimental
    models considering light harvesting for indoor and outdoor environments. A novel
    framework that generates power using PV cells is presented for the indoor environment
    in [116]. For indoor settings, [117] reported W power using an artificial source
    of light energy at different intensities. An EH framework for smart building using
    PV is developed in [24] that generates V output voltage with mA pulse current
    in an indoor environment. Apart from this, the authors in [118] proposed an energy
    estimation algorithm to analyze the random behavior of light intensity in the
    indoor environment. It generates a high-efficient end node harvesting device that
    produces 0.8% error while predicting energy availability in one day. Authors in
    [119] compared wireless power transfer (WPT) and solar energy sources. Interestingly,
    the authors proposed a hybrid source that combines the merits of the aforementioned
    sources. 4.1.2. Thermal Unlike solar energy, thermal energy is available indoors
    and outdoors. Thermal energy can be collected by an electrical and mechanical
    source and converted into consumable electrical energy. The heat from various
    sources, including sunlight, engine exhaustion, indoor temperature, temperature
    difference, and even body heat, can be counted as a source. The generation method
    is cost-effective and efficient as it generates electricity from the abovementioned
    sources. However, the energy produced using thermal sources needs better energy
    conversion efficiency [90]. It can be made possible using different harvesters,
    such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), biochip, nanomaterial, and cloth-printed
    harvesters, which are commercially available. Thermoelectric (TE) and pyroelectric
    (PE) methods are the most widely used thermal harvesters. For a thermoelectric
    generator, an -type junction is used. This junction is connected to the heating
    material. Aluminum oxide and silicon wafers [120] are the most widely used heating
    materials because of their high conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion.
    The transmission of carriers across the junction produces the necessary potential
    difference and is sent to the voltage controller and converter. The voltage thus
    obtained can be increased using a large number of junctions between heating materials.
    Finally, the increased DC voltage can be transmitted wirelessly to one or more
    IoT sensors. On the other hand, the pyroelectric solution uses a special crystal
    material that generates considerable energy under temperature fluctuation in the
    environment. The design of the thermal transducer is not simply restricted to
    the approaches of TE and PE. However, as with many other thermal harvesters, other
    proposed transducers are described in Table 6. Table 6. Comparison of different
    thermal transducers. Harvesting technology Characteristics Average power/efficiency

    the increasing energy demand of IoT networks, energy harvesting through RF signals
    (RF-EH) evolved as an alternative technique that offers reduced operational cost
    and attains a sustainable framework. Instead of using conventional energy sources
    (power grid), RF signals are employed to recharge the batteries of IoT devices.
    Typically, ambient EM sources like cellular, microwave, and infrared (IR) radiation
    harvest the RF energy using high-gain antennas. The harvested energy is processed,
    rectified, and stored for future use. Rectenna, voltage multiplier, and storage-control
    interfaces are the building blocks of an RF-EH module. The rectenna block consists
    of a dipole or a patch antenna, along with a rectifier (Schottky diodes) that
    performs AC-DC conversion. A reconfigurable rectifier integrated with double-stage
    controlled maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed in [127] to have a
    highly efficient energy harvesting node at dB. The peak power conversion efficiency
    can be written as (1) where is the DC power at output of rectifier and is the
    harvested rectifier’s power at the input. An optimal dual-stage RF-EH circuit
    is fabricated in [128]. The work in [129] discusses an ambient ultrahigh-frequency
    (UHF) enabled energy harvesting technique. The energy density of RF-EH is very
    low in comparison to other sources, as investigated in [128], [129]. Hence a voltage
    multiplier is utilized for further enhancing the voltage level [130]. The storage
    and control interface is responsible for the persistent power flow to the endpoint
    devices [131]. Several RF harvesters are classified according to their efficiencies
    and are studied in [132]. In [133], the authors reported energy harvesting strategies
    using single and multiple sources. There has been considerable research on low
    power transfer to IoT end users in the past few years, specifically where replenishment
    of batteries is difficult [134]. With a focus on WPT, some recent literature enhanced
    performance and optimized design parameters to increase the energy efficiency
    of the harvested node [135], [136]. However, the WPT mechanism requires a fixed
    charging point, and there is a limit on power density as well. Recently, the utilization
    of RF signals to deliver energy and convey information signals has received considerable
    research attention. This technique is referred to as simultaneous wireless power
    and information transfer (SWIPT). The authors in [137], [138], [139] discussed
    resource allocation and performance analysis of different SWIPT-aided systems.
    Moreover, the authors in [140] discussed the time division strategy for power
    and information transfer (see Table 7). Table 7. Comparison of different RF transducers.

    networks, IoT has incorporated several sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, communication
    devices, and so on. These devices mostly remain operational, resulting in limited
    battery life for a few days. Therefore, batteries play a significant part in ensuring
    sustainability in smart applications. However, most of the harvested energy is
    wasted due to the losses in the circuits or not managing it properly. As a result,
    not all the harvested energy is stored in the batteries. It can be prevented by
    keeping track of the energy from the harvesting stage to the storage stage. In
    this context, authors in [145] employed various methods to disseminate the significance
    of energy trackers in energy harvesting systems. Some researchers focused on detecting
    the sun’s motion to improve the efficiency of harvested energy. In contrast, the
    authors of [146] presented an animal tracking-based thermal harvesting system
    based on the temperature differential between the animal’s body and the immediate
    surroundings. This survey paper focused on tracking the harvesting energy after
    the transducers stage so that the energy flow to the storage interface is efficiently
    managed. Some of the existing available energy trackers are depicted in Table
    8. 4.2.1. Solar charger controller The overall output voltage of the solar panel
    is typically quite low. As a result, researchers have proposed different charge
    control mechanisms to achieve an efficient harvesting framework, such as Pulse
    width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [152]. PWM controller
    can handle the flow of current from the solar panel with reduced efficiency due
    to the discontinuity in the harvested energy. It is frequently used for low-powered
    devices [153]. As a result, it can contribute to the sustainability of IoT devices
    with lower efficiency. On the other hand, MPPT has been identified as a charge
    controller circuit that optimally manages the harvested energy from solar panels
    to storage interfaces efficiently. It tracks voltage and maximum power using the
    most commonly used perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm. In [154], the
    harvested energy is provided to a boost converter (DC-DC) using MPPT to improve
    the conversion efficiency. The authors obtained an analytical model for a harvester
    in [155] using MPPT and achieved 96% efficiency. A novel wearable fitness monitoring
    device powered by solar cells is developed in [156]. The harvesting efficiency
    of the system ( ) is computed as (2) where , are the efficiency of the conversion
    interface and MPPT respectively. Table 8. Comparison of different energy tracker

    4.2.2. Rectifier/voltage multiplier topology It has been noticed that RF energy
    received from ambient sources needs a better power density to make the IoT device
    sustainable. As a result, power converters or amplifier circuits are required
    to drive the low-powered DC load. It can be made feasible by incorporating the
    rectifiers with capacitors and diodes to form the multi-stage voltage multipliers
    circuits. So that voltage gain can be increased at the output of the RF energy
    harvester. In [157], authors designed multi-stage circuits such as Dickson and
    Cockcroft–Walton voltage multipliers to obtain high-voltage at the output. These
    circuits mainly act as energy trackers or DC-DC converters to enhance the harvested
    voltage at the output. In this way, RF energy is properly managed from the transmitter
    end to the storage interface. 4.3. Storage interface This is a part of the power
    management system. After energy is harvested, it needs to be utilized at the end
    node application with the help of storage interface device. A number of storage
    interfaces are available, however, we list out only the most commonly used ones
    as follows. 4.3.1. Rechargeable batteries This type of battery contains a large
    number of capacitors and has high energy density. However, it is hardly used for
    storage as it has a low depth-of-discharge (DoD) rating. Moreover, there are numerous
    ways to select a battery for a self-sustainable IoT network, such as battery life
    expectancy, the necessity for rapid charging cycles, size, and weight, which are
    the most crucial factors influencing the decision [158]. Although rechargeable
    batteries/secondary batteries have less capacity and temperature stability than
    primary batteries, they do not require periodic maintenance and replacement at
    complete discharge. The most popular battery for EH-IoT is lithium-ion. Depending
    on the operating cycle, the total efficiency of battery storage ranges from 60%
    to 80%. These batteries do not operate well in low temperatures due to increased
    internal resistance, resulting in a self-discharge [159]. However, there are Alkaline
    MnO batteries available with a low self-discharge rate [160]. These batteries
    are used in the IoT applications, such as IoT monitoring applications that require
    data monitoring even for smaller intervals of time with high precision (smart
    healthcare, smart home, and smart industries) at a higher cost. Apart from this,
    Lead-Acid batteries are used in IoT applications that require data monitoring
    with larger sampling intervals and are mainly used in environmental monitoring
    applications. These batteries are inexpensive, highly reliable, and efficient,
    with limited cycle capacity and poor performance under adverse circumstances [161].
    4.3.2. Super-capacitors These are high-energy-density batteries with high DoD
    ratings. Supercapacitor discharges on its own, hence it cannot store energy for
    a longer duration [162]. Several studies revealed that the self-discharging nature
    of the supercapacitors is due to leakage and fast charging and can be compensated
    by charging it over a longer period of time [163]. The severity of the self-discharging
    problem is not only determined by the device capacity but also differs among manufacturers
    and even among specific production batches. This results from variations in the
    materials used, the manufacturing process, and production irregularities. As a
    result, selecting a reliable supercapacitor for appropriate IoT applications is
    still a significant issue [164]. It is mostly employed in applications requiring
    a power source with a shorter charging time and a wider operational temperature
    range and lacks involvement of toxic heavy metals, such as smart healthcare, smart
    irrigation, and smart agriculture. 4.3.3. Recent advancement in energy storage
    batteries The development of hybrid storage devices and novel materials enables
    a breakthrough in advancing energy storage interfaces. In [165], a hybrid storage
    system that increases operational duration is developed by integrating rechargeable
    batteries with supercapacitors. A unique ionic liquid combination is employed
    as an electrolyte for supercapacitor applications to enable IoT applications that
    demand a large working temperature range (60 to 80 ) and a low charging/discharging
    rate [166]. In addition, several IoT applications (smart factories, smart automobiles,
    etc.) need a high voltage than a large working temperature and life span. So,
    asymmetric capacitors were developed by fusing several conducting polymers (ECPs),
    amorphous manganese dioxide (a-MnO ), and activated carbon. These capacitors offer
    two times the power of conventional supercapacitors [167]. Additionally, the storage
    capacity of supercapacitors and sodium-ion batteries is increased by using graphene-based
    materials [168]. Furthermore, the energy density and safety of rechargeable batteries
    are improved by using Lithium-ion batteries with solid-state electrolytes at a
    higher cost. However, some IoT applications require high capacity, high voltage,
    and low cost. To achieve this, authors in [169] develop carbon monoxide-free layered
    cathode material. Apart from this, different types of inorganic materials such
    as lithium-polymer [170], lithium nitride [171], perovskite [172], and sulfide
    [173] have used in solid-state batteries to extend the lifetime of the storage
    interface. 5. The energy saving and resource constrained optimizers for sustainable
    IoT operations Trillions of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and communication
    interfaces will be deployed in the atmosphere during the emerging IoT era. Such
    interfaces will be using power from energy harvesting sources via storage interfaces
    and energy trackers. So, once the energy is harvested and stored efficiently with
    the help of energy trackers, it needs to be used properly at IoT device to keep
    it sustainable for ubiquitous operations. The energy stored for sustainable IoT
    devices can be utilized effectively by energy-saving or resource-optimizer protocols.
    Energy saving and resource optimization in EH-IoT is a primary concern because
    it incorporates a large number of resource-constrained devices that come with
    diverse QoS requirements. Moreover, different researchers have designed different
    decision-making topologies, algorithms, standards, and conceptual designs for
    the optimal use of harvested and stored energy [174]. Here, we will discuss the
    current research trends and challenges associated with decision-making tasks in
    this process flow. 5.1. Optimizing device power Devices play a crucial role in
    managing the power of IoT networks. Depending on the flow of data, a typical node
    in an IoT network is of two types i.e., the source and the sink. IoT combines
    different sources and sinks that can communicate without human intervention [175].
    For example, when the source and sink devices are connected via an RF chain, the
    transmit power of the RF network should be minimized [176], [177], [178]. In addition,
    if the connectivity between the source and sink fails, the data packets are lost.
    Retransmission of the same packet consumes a considerable amount of power. Cognitive
    radio (CR) can overcome these challenges [113], [177]. This technology monitors
    the wireless spectrum and identifies the holes (unoccupied channels). Design and
    optimization of a CR-assisted framework that ensures spectrum efficiency can be
    found in [113], [178]. Joint optimization of computational tasks and the energy
    transfer parameters employed with the design objective of increasing the network
    lifetime is discussed in [179]. To adjust the device’s duty cycle and dynamic
    transmission power, an opportunistic routing policy is proposed in [180]. 5.2.
    Data optimization Research articles show that SANET, along with optimized data
    processors, would drive the next-generation technology in the renewable energy
    sector to make the existing technologies sustainable [181]. Data optimization
    is the most crucial aspect of the energy-saving process since the consolidated
    data requires a smaller setup for management. To optimize data rate and data collection
    in cognitive radio and D2D communication, different modulation and coding schemes
    are studied in [182], [183], [184]. This ensures energy-efficient communication
    from the data aggregator to other nodes. Instead of transmitting the original
    data, only the compressed data is communicated. Hadoop is another data-management
    framework that allows decentralized storage and processing of data at the bit
    level. This framework consists of clusters of systems utilizing simpler algorithms.
    Moreover, several authors have explored the compressive sensing method to analyze
    performance metrics, e.g., EE, security, reliability, etc. [185], [186]. These
    works explain how the data at the receiving end is extracted from the compressed
    data. Clustering is another method to efficiently transmit consolidated data to
    the central server [187]. There are many research studies where authors have discussed
    the clustering method for various sensors [188]. In [189], the authors have shown
    how to capture remote data using a battery-driven wireless IoT. IoT systems clock
    and log data are coordinated using network time protocol (NTP) and data logger,
    respectively. The authors in [189] has provided a statistical model to predict
    the battery’s charging and discharging rate and analyze energy consumption at
    IoT nodes. The average current is obtained as follows (3) where , denote the instantaneous
    current and the number of data samples received through the entire time slot.
    Battery life, , can be subsequently calculated as (4) where denotes the battery
    capacity. 5.3. Time constrained power optimization In order to optimize power,
    time constraints play a vital role in the synchronization process, sleep mode,
    standby, and idle state of the sensing node. While the sensor is not in use, turning
    it off is better to save power. To manage energy, different time limits are set
    for different methods, namely, sleep timing, traffic monitoring [190], and appropriate
    duty cycle. In [191], [192], devices are put in sleep mode after completing their
    tasks, as sleep mode consumes negligible power. MAC duty cycling is another strategy
    that puts the device into idle mode until the next process cycle begins. This
    method is also energy efficient [193], [194]. 5.4. Trade-off among bandwidth,
    range and power consumption A typical IoT network must consider trade-offs on
    energy usage, bandwidth, and coverage area. The design objectives are to maximize
    the coverage area, minimize transmit power and improve the bandwidth [195]. A
    long-range (1.8 km), multi-hop, and self-powered IoT framework is proposed in
    [196] to be applied in agriculture. The network delivers an average power consumption
    of W at a -min interval for a sensor node [197]. In another work, Bluetooth is
    used to achieve long-range support, and the framework is built on BQ25570 IC.
    It has the following applications, e.g. battery charging and voltage conditioning
    [198]. 5.5. Standardization for EH-IoT This standardization is crucial for achieving
    interoperability and compatibility among self-sustainable IoT devices. It will
    help in optimizing the IoT resources by ensuring that they all follow the same
    set of rules and protocols by eradicating external peripheral interfaces. So,
    to incorporate all the EH-IoT under one platform, the International electrotechnical
    commission (IEC) has laid out standards for testing and evaluating different types
    of transducer and wireless protocols for green energy solutions. Some are discussed
    below for energy harvesting transducers and self-sustainable IoT communication
    protocols. 5.5.1. EH transducer Leading standardization development organizations
    (SDOs) have made the efforts to standardize EH transducers [199]. These standards
    are discussed in Table 9. Table 9. EH-IoT transducers standardization. Transducer

    5.5.2. Wireless protocol The international organization for standardization (ISO)
    introduced standards for wireless networking protocols to improve interoperability.
    Interoperable wireless protocols for low-power devices are studied in [200], [201].
    Table 10 mentions some of the standards released by ISO and IEC. These EH-IoT
    devices conform to short-packet systems using amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency

    Upon identifying the various sections (Section 1 to Section 5), it becomes apparent
    that different energy harvesting sources can power the IoT devices for various
    IoT applications as shown in Table 11. The introduction section has offered a
    brief discussion on IoT applications for readers with the scope of establishing
    the relation among IoT applications, devices and energy harvesting interfaces.
    In this section, we investigate the comprehensive discussion of the IoT applications
    based on the devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces
    that can be utilized. • Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture plays a significant
    role in enhancing crop cultivation by incorporating different sensing and actuation
    interfaces, including temperature, humidity, chemicals, and many more. These sensors
    detect the physical changes in the surrounding environment of the crops, soils,
    flowers, and plants. Additionally, various chemical sensors are used to determine
    the potential of hydrogen (PH) level and nutrient properties of the soils to optimize
    agriculture practices. Some researchers also employed proximity and position sensors
    to detect the animals’ movement in the fields [203]. The sensing data also requires
    actuation actions, which are usually carried out by solenoid valves, DC pumps,
    AC pumps, and relays. These actuation actions can be taken remotely with the help
    of communications protocols that can be operated up to a longer distance, i.e.,
    LoRa, Cellular, and SigFox [221], [222]. All these devices require significant
    power for their operations to run smoothly. Among all the sources, various researchers
    identified light energy as the most viable source to generate a considerable amount
    of electricity to be used in smart agriculture practices [202]. • Smart city:
    The smart city is conceptualized as a network that incorporates many sensors,
    actuators, and communication devices. The utilization of the devices in smart
    city can vary significantly based on day-to-day requirements. In some scenarios,
    the focus of smartness may be ensuring safety during natural calamities and emergencies
    such as earthquakes, floods, or fires [223]. In other situations, proper management
    of parking, lighting, waste management, the smart grid, smart sanitation, and
    many more. So smart cities incorporate almost all ranges of sensors and actuators
    [202], [203], [224], as shown in Table 11. It also employs a wide range of communication
    protocols in most scenarios to exchange real-time data up to a distance of several
    kilometers (Kms). These communication modules and actuators require power. As
    a result, they are powered by solar energy by controlling the peak of electrical
    energy consumption in the hottest and coldest months [225]. On the other hand,
    sensors used in the indoor area of smart cities are powered by RF sources [226].
    • Smart environment: Weather conditions significantly influence numerous applications,
    including agriculture, irrigation, and traffic monitoring. These applications
    mainly incorporate sensors that can measure physical and chemical changes in the
    environment. The light, temperature, humidity, biomolecules, and rain sensors
    are utilized to detect physical changes in the surroundings, such as rainfall,
    forest fires, solar irradiance, and air pollution levels. Additionally, sensors
    such as motion, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are used in the early detection
    of catastrophes in smart environments [227], [228], [229]. These sensed values
    typically trigger relays to manage external actions and DC motors using PWM signals
    to control the speed of devices like fire-avoidance robots to avoid catastrophe.
    The smart environment mainly employs communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX,
    Cellular, and LoRa to exchange information in metropolitan and wide-area networks.
    The energy from light and thermal sources provides adequate power to the sensors
    and communication devices employed in smart environments [206], [208]. Additionally,
    RF sources are usually used to power the sensors in highly populated locations
    using radio frequency generators for the device’s ubiquitous operations in a smart
    environment to prevent disaster [207]. • Smart heath care: Smart health care,
    or the Internet of medical things, is the systematic implementation mode that
    links healthcare services to the IoT via various sensors, actuators, and acceptable
    communication protocols. Smart health care predominantly requires sensors such
    as heartbeat, biomolecular, chemical, and gyroscopes to monitor the physical and
    chemical changes in the human body, like heartbeat, muscle movement, blood pressure,
    hemoglobin content, oxygen level, and many more. On the other hand, the wearable
    sensors may also be mounted to the human’s skin or tied to the clothes, which
    work by reading the values with RF signals. If sensor readings fall below safe
    limits or a person’s health enters a critical state, the nearby hospital authority
    is alerted using short-range communication protocols such as Bluetooth, BLE, and
    Zigbee [209], [210]. It is also notified at a longer distance using Cellular communication
    protocols [230]. Additional actuators, such as buzzers, also alert the individual
    to take precautions. This application mainly relies on short-range network communication
    protocols that operate by harvesting the energy from radio frequency [231], which
    usually has low bandwidth and does not harm the human body. • Smart Industry:
    The idea of IoT has rapidly developed in the industrial sector over recent years
    to revolutionize it with Industry 4.0. Its presence is in almost all business,
    private, and government sectors, like smart schools, hospitals, shopping complexes,
    grids, offices, and retail outlets [211]. Due to the vast amount of IoT applications
    in smart industries, there is no limit to incorporating the sensing, actuation,
    and communication modules as shown in Table 11. It involves various sensors and
    actuators that can help monitor and automate the decision-making process, leading
    to more efficient, faster, and cost-effective production. Moreover, it incorporates
    short-range (BLE 5.0, Zigbee, RFID, Z-wave WiFi, and Zigbee) and wide-range communication
    devices (LoRa, SigFox, and Cellular) to provide interoperability within and between
    the different sectors by enabling smooth operations [212]. In order to power this
    extensive set of devices, all feasible energy sources are utilized to provide
    uninterrupted power to various devices at different layers. Solar, thermal, and
    electromagnetic (EM) sources are the most commonly employed sources in the industry.
    Authors in [232], [233] designed self-powered sensors using a thermally conductive
    pyroelectric block for industrial applications. Additionally, authors in [234],
    [235] have employed EM and solar sources to power the IoT devices used in the
    industry. Finally, authors in [236] focused on providing low power to the IoT
    devices in various industrial sectors using a microstrip patch antenna to regulate
    the operations of different IoT devices using the energy emitted by the mobile
    base station and the WiFi transmitter. • Smart Security: In recent years, there
    has been a sudden exponential growth of security systems in our daily lives. These
    systems typically involve various sensors, such as an accelerometer, proximity,
    gyroscope, and infrared (IR) sensors, that can detect the presence of any unauthorized
    individual. It also employs other sensors that may detect chemical changes, such
    as harmful gas emissions, radiation levels increase, and leakages of deadly substances
    in the nearby region [237]. Based on these sensors, actuators such as a buzzer,
    pneumatic cylinders, and relays are most commonly employed to turn off the door
    and produce alarm sounds in case of a security breach. These applications necessitate
    using both short-range and long-range communications protocols for monitoring
    from remote locations and having connections among the devices with short-range
    communication devices. For seamless functionality in a smart security system,
    authors in [238] implemented a solar energy harvesting unit in a -storey building
    to detect the presence of any unauthorized individual. Apart from this, the authors
    in [239] implemented an RF energy harvesting source to establish the connection
    among the sensors using short-range communications protocols to detect the presence
    of any harmful gases in the surroundings. • Smart transport: In recent times,
    advancements in communication modules and several devices at different IoT layers
    have significantly enhanced transportation, which aims to improve driver safety,
    reduce traffic congestion, etc. These advancements incorporate motion sensors,
    gyroscopes, infrared sensors, GPS, and camera sensors to monitor the location
    and behaviors of drivers and passengers [215]. In addition, continuous monitoring
    is ensured through the use of temperature, pressure, and oxygen sensors within
    the vehicle to safeguard the driver. In order to enhance the comfortable experience
    of the driver, hydraulic actuators are utilized in various parts of the vehicles.
    Moreover, the pneumatic cylinder in vehicles using the devices may avoid injuries
    in accidents or mishaps. The increasing number of vehicles on the road poses a
    collision risk, which mandates the requirement of communication devices among
    vehicles. It incorporates all long-range communication protocols to identify the
    traffic pattern on the road within certain distances. Moreover, it also incorporates
    BLE, Bluetooth, and Zigbee to establish communication among the different devices
    inside the vehicle [216]. Power management in smart transportation is still a
    significant issue for many researchers due to continuous battery replacement and
    fuel consumption. To address this, authors in [217] integrate the piezoelectric
    device into the tires of the vehicles, through which driving-induced mechanical
    energy is converted to electric energy. Apart from this, several studies [240],
    [241], [242] also focused on incorporating power into smart vehicles using the
    highly efficient solar cell module to increase the power supply by up to 30%.
    7. Future scope Considering the self-sustainable IoT device based on the layers
    architecture design for smart applications, we have emphasized the layer-wise
    issues of implementing sustainability. It is employed in sensing, actuation, processing,
    and a transmission interface by utilizing energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy management, energy tracking, energy storage, and energy optimizers. Based
    on that, we have outlined the potential areas for further study in developing
    self-sustaining IoT systems. 7.1. Sustainable smart network With the rapid deployment
    of IoT nodes, the data generated by such nodes are also anticipated to grow manifold.
    These data operations necessitated external hardware assistance for storage, which
    will be an expense for power and outlay. This extraneous requirement will pose
    a threat to sustainable IoT operations due to the increase in power consumption.
    Moreover, traditional data collection and processing techniques might fail to
    handle, analyze and extract information at that scale for a long time with a fixed
    energy storage device. Additional energy harvesting devices and storage interfaces
    must be included in the existing EH-IoT system design to address this issue. Further,
    different IoT devices generate heterogeneous data, which is difficult to be processed
    using an existing processing interface. An intelligent IoT network works on the
    premise of learning from the pattern of past data and predicting data for future
    instances. Thus the system’s performance can be enhanced through better detection
    accuracy [243], [244]. Thus the cost of a storage interface and communication
    resources can be minimized by limiting the number of re-transmissions. However,
    machine algorithms to classify problems related to self-sustainable IoT devices
    are still in their infancy [245] to connect it to layered architecture design,
    and significant research scope exists in this area. In a large-scale self-sustainable
    IoT network, how to analyze collected data through deep learning techniques to
    obtain design insights is an emerging field. 7.2. Secure energy harvesting design
    A self-sustainable IoT device needs to collect energy from different available
    sources in close proximity for ubiquitous operations. However, this energy harvesting
    task can raise security concerns as attackers can produce unnecessary radiation
    as the malware energy in the processing system when extracting power from the
    RF source. So malware exposed to electricity generation data from unwanted radiation
    may cause significant privacy issues for users. It may sometimes damage the energy
    storage interface without proper protection. On the other hand, if an intruder
    knows the system’s harvesting pattern, it might launch different types of attacks
    at the user-end, namely, time synchronization, replay, dynamic data injections,
    brute force attack, man in middle attack or can generate unwanted signals. On
    the other hand, communication among IoT devices may also raise privacy concerns
    for users. Extensive sensitive data is stored, processed, and transmitted by sustainable
    IoT nodes powered by the energy storage interface. If this harvested energy is
    continuously used to transmit information vulnerable to replay and denial of service
    attacks, the stored energy will drain more quickly. Although technologies like
    Physical layer security (PLS) and Blockchain [246], [247] are integrated with
    SWIPT to form an IoT-based cooperative energy harvesting network, the issue of
    energy outages still needs to be addressed effectively. 7.3. Trade-off among energy
    consumption, bandwidth and coverage area Certain IoT communication modules like
    LoRa, WiFi, SigFox, and cellular devices can communicate with each other at a
    long distance. Managing power for such long-distance IoT communication devices
    is crucial in EH. However, the process of storing harvested energy for a longer
    time duration is a challenge in itself. Hence providing the required energy to
    the module to cover a wide area while maintaining low power consumption is difficult.
    A decrease in bandwidth leads to a decrease in the data rate. Efficient power
    management involving a the trade-off among energy consumption, bandwidth, and
    coverage area poses a design challenge. 7.4. Energy supply design for sporadic
    source and hazardous material During the daytime, the solar power supply works
    effectively. However, it is not the case at night. Solar supply uses PV cells
    to convert light into energy. Nonetheless, solar supply requires more space. Energy-intensive
    devices like laptops and smart electric cars consume more power to perform for
    a long duration. Nevertheless, small-scale PVs play a significant role in calculators,
    watches, and small devices. A typical example is the monitoring and identifying
    faults in the power distribution system using solar panels [248]. Furthermore,
    solar irradiance is stochastic in nature, with seasonal and temporal variations.
    As a result, depending only on solar energy harvesting for self-sustaining IoT
    system design may result in energy outages, where energy harvested by the solar
    panel will be less than the energy consumed by IoT devices. On the other hand,
    EH can be achieved using an RF field with a certain signal frequency. The potential
    safety threats must be considered in case more RF fields are used. So it is challenging
    to design efficient PV cells and maintain a safe level of exposure to RF intensities.
    7.5. Storage unit 7.5.1. Data storage While designing the system for a specific
    IoT application, the main challenge lies in cleaning, processing, and interpreting
    the massive data collected by the sensors. Storing bulky data is another challenge.
    Depending on the self-sustainable IoT application, an extensive data acquisition
    system might be needed, which calls for a storage unit with a large capacity.
    The storage data of the IoT sensor for smart weather monitoring, intelligent transportation
    system, and many other smart applications require data to be sensed at small sampling
    intervals. When data is sensed continuously for a longer period of time with smaller
    sample intervals, a more significant amount of energy and storage is required.
    Some researchers have used big data storage systems as an enabling architecture.
    However, the problem of storing and sensing data over a longer period of time
    with a small sampling interval still needs to be addressed. 7.5.2. Power storage
    Due to the rapid charge or discharge cycles, a rechargeable battery is insufficient
    for energy storage. Also, a rechargeable battery is made up of a large number
    of capacitors, which occupies space. For example, a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery
    has got higher energy capacity but a fast discharge rate. On the other hand, lithium-ion
    and nickel metal hybrid batteries come with higher energy density and a lower
    discharge rate. However, due to their highly combustible nature, they do not provide
    a viable choice for IoT applications. Solid-state batteries come with a minimum
    rate of self-discharge and are eco-friendly. However, their use in IoT could be
    improved, as they come at a high price. Since super-capacitors have a large energy
    capacity, they may be considered as one of the alternative possibilities for EH-IoT.
    However, because of its auto-draining rate, it is not an ideal fit for EH-IoT
    applications. A low-cost battery with a high energy consumption volume and low
    discharge rate poses a design challenge. Different storage units are outlined
    in Section 4.3. 7.6. Hardware assistance Hardware design in self-sustainable IoT
    devices needs to cope with many issues. The power harvested from the surrounding
    is often intermittent. This leads to heavy fluctuation in current at IoT node.
    Hence, small-sized hardware that yields stable performance for a wide range of
    power is required at the energy harvesting stage. The harvesting stage includes
    transducers, MPPT, DC-DC converters, AC-DC converters, and supercapacitors. Arranging
    all such components with sensors, actuators, and communication devices will result
    in a highly dense circuit. How many bulky circuits can coexist with nanomaterials
    poses a relevant research question. 7.7. Network congestion in EH-IoT network
    Previously data sensed by IoT devices were used to store in the cloud. Several
    IoT devices or platforms use the same cloud platform for data storage. However,
    accessing the required data from vast aggregated data available on the cloud takes
    time and effort. In case different IoT devices wish to access data from the same
    cloud simultaneously, it will increase incoming traffic in the network. Recently
    in [249], edge computing is proposed to optimize energy efficiency for medical
    devices using their inactive mode. Edge computing networks are dense and highly
    congested. In this technique, firstly, data is transferred to a storage unit near
    IoT device. After sorting and analyzing data, the local storage unit transfers
    some of the data to the cloud. Thus reducing both latencies and network congestion
    in this process at the cost of increased power consumption due to the dense network.
    As a result, the tradeoff between dense storage network deployment and power consumption
    in a sustainable IoT system still needs to be addressed. 8. Conclusion IoT is
    an effective solution to our day-to-day problems that open up numerous new opportunities
    worldwide. This is an interesting phenomenon in networking devices, where the
    reach of device connectivity increases every year. IoT incorporates billions of
    sensors, actuators, and communication devices in various IoT applications. This
    paper addresses several IoT applications and clarifies the necessitates of IoT
    devices, in particular smart applications. It is accomplished by incorporating
    five different interfaces such as sensing interface, energy harvesting interface,
    storage interface, microcontroller interface, and wireless interface. It focuses
    on bridging the gap between IoT application and IoT system design centered on
    layered architecture design. Besides, the study of various types of sensors, actuators,
    and communication protocols, this paper also discusses the various types of energy
    harvesting techniques to make the self-sustainable IoT system design. The primary
    task of EH-IoT is to guarantee smooth functioning using an uncontrolled and unpredicted
    power supply. This paper also investigates the comparison among the different
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device. While reviewing the
    different research articles, we also examined the effect of the stochastic source
    on the memory interface. This work is concluded with the potential research problems
    that will enable researchers to build a new paradigm for self-sustainable IoT
    system design. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they
    have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

  description: The creation, distribution, and marketing of food and other goods within
    the boundaries of a metropolitan area are broadly referred to as urban agriculture.
    Urban smart farms use aeroponics to grow fresh and healthy food in a cleaner,
    easier, and more effective manner. With 90% less land and 98% less water needed,
    our cutting-edge technology is the ideal option for farming at home or in an urban
    environment. The importance of greenhouse farming is also discussed in the chapter.
    A system is developed for agricultural field monitoring in IoT-based smart farming
    with the aid of sensors like light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.
    Farmers can keep an eye on the state of their fields from anywhere. Smart farming
    that is IoT-based is significantly extra effectual than traditional farming. MQTT
    and HTTP are used for the implementation of these models. Finally, supervising
    and scheduling the devices are discussed.

  description: A sensory transducer is a device that can convert environmental energy
    or event into a signal/energy that can be stored for further processing. For these
    conversions, small and low-cost devices are preferred by many engineers. Most
    of the devices used in such ubiquitous applications work in a hostile environment,
    where changing or replacing the power module is almost impossible. To overcome
    these problems, energy scavenging may be the solution. Researchers focus more
    on such devices because they regenerate power from the environment and can be
    used for a more extended period with less maintenance monitoring systems with
    the Internet of Things (IoT). This work summarizes an overview of the low-cost,
    self-powered sensory transducers used in different areas of applications. The
    research aims at the different ways to generate/recharge the power sources and
    their uses on different applications. It also focuses on recent challenges and
    the future scope of the device. Moreover, the work enlightens on the interrelation
    of self-powered devices to the evolution of Green IoT.

    Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN) are the natural extensive of wireless
    sensor networks (WSN). The majority of sensor nodes, including their means of
    transmitting and receiving, are deployed completely below the ground for WUSN.
    As a promising underground sensing technique, WUSN has the advantages of concealment,
    ease of deployment, timeliness of data, reliability and coverage density (Akyildiz
    and Stuntebeck, 2006). In recent years, WUSN has been employed to the smart sensing
    of underground infrastructures and their adjacent underground environments. WUSN
    is already widely used in the monitoring of underground coal mines (Wu et al.,
    2010, Kennedy and Bedford, 2014), transportation tunnels (Bennett et al., 2010,
    Stajano et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2020) and utility tunnels (Huang et al., 2019,
    Zhou et al., 2020). Both the structural health condition of underground structures
    and the underground environments such as temperature, humidity, gas concentrations
    can be monitored using relevant wireless sensors. The wireless signals in these
    scenarios still transmit in air. Differently, the wireless signals transmit in
    dielectric soil medium and thus undergo much larger attenuation for WUSN in some
    other applications. For example, WUSN is used to detect the fluid leakage of buried
    pipeline (Lin et al., 2019). Leakage localization algorithms are also proposed
    based on different sensing parameters and types of pipeline (Abdelhafidh et al.,
    2018). Other applications are like soil moisture monitoring (Bogena et al., 2009,
    Bogena et al., 2010, Di Fusco et al., 2018), soil permittivity estimation (Salam
    et al., 2019b) and seismic mapping (Saeed et al., 2019). This paper only focuses
    on the signal propagating in soil medium. It is a great challenge to estimate
    the signal path loss for WUSN due to the complex signal propagation mechanism
    and complex soil dielectric behavior (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006). A reliable
    and accurate path loss estimation method is needed in the design stage to determine
    the maximum internode distance and network topology (Akyildiz et al., 2009). In
    the deployment of WUSN system, the signal path loss is used to estimate the received
    signal strength. What’s more, signal path loss estimation is crucial to node connectivity
    analysis during the operation of WUSN system (Sun et al., 2011, Trang et al.,
    2018). Based on the estimated path loss, the sensor can adaptively select the
    energy-saving transmission configuration to prolong the network lifetime. There
    are some analytical models for characterizing the signal propagation in soils.
    However, analytical models are not easy to use in complex scenarios such as multi
    ground layers and existence of underground structures (Mekid et al., 2017). Therefore,
    this paper aims to develop a comprehensive numerical model to directly obtain
    the total signal path loss between two sensor nodes. In the numerical model, the
    details of wireless sensor node such as the antenna size, antenna orientation
    are modelled. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Part 2, related
    works will be reviewed concerning the existing analytical propagation models;
    In Part 3, a refined numerical model for simulating the signal propagation is
    developed in commercial software FEKO (FEldberechnung bei Körpern mit beliebiger
    Oberfläche) and the numerical model is validated using outdoor signal transmission
    tests; In Part 4, the effect of soil physical properties, signal frequency, antenna
    orientation and soil heterogeneity on signal path loss are parametrically studied;
    In Part 5, several conclusions are provided. 2. State of arts Communication channels
    of WUSN need to be clarified before the introduction of signal propagation models.
    There are three types of communication channels for WUSN as shown in Fig. 1, Underground
    to Underground (UG2UG), Underground to Aboveground (UG2AG) and Aboveground to
    Underground (AG2UG). For UG2AG and AG2UG channels, wireless electromagnetic (EM)
    signals transmit both in air and soil medium. EM waves reflect at the soil-air
    interface, which causes additional signal path loss. For UG2UG channels, EM waves
    propagate in the soil medium throughout the transmission path. Therefore, three
    types of signal propagation can be characterized from the communication channels.
    Type (I): signal propagation in air; Type (II): signal propagation in soil medium;
    Type (III): signal propagation at the soil-air interface. Friis equation can be
    used to model the EM waves propagation in air (Li et al., 2007). Fresnel equation
    can calculate the signal path loss at the soil-air interface due wave reflection
    or refraction (Bogena et al., 2009). Download : Download high-res image (121KB)

    for WUSN. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, three categories of single path
    propagation models in soils have been reported as shown in Table 1. The first
    category is the series of Modified Friis models. This series began with the conventional
    Modified Friis model proposed by Akyildiz et al. (2009). NC Modified Friis model
    proposed by Nchimunya et al. (2010) took account of the signal attenuation induced
    by wave reflection and refraction. Soil complex dielectric constant (CDC) model
    was incorporated into single path propagation models to consider the effect of
    soil physical conditions. Peplinksi model was adopted in Conventional and NC Modified
    Friis models. Other models in this series adopted different methods, such as TDR
    (Time Domain Reflectometry) measurements (Sadeghioon et al., 2017) or MBSDM (Mineralogy-Based
    Soil Dielectric Model) (Sambo et al., 2019), to predict the soil CDC. The Modified
    Friis based models are only valid in the far field region of antenna, which is
    often neglected in the past studies. Table 1. Signal propagation models in soils.
    Propagation models CDC prediction Antenna field region Modified Friis Conventional
    Modified Friis (Akyildiz et al., 2009) Peplinski model NC Modified Friis (Nchimunya
    et al., 2010) Peplinski model Far field TDR Modified Friis (Sadeghioon et al.,
    2017) TDR measurement MBSDM Modified Friis (Sambo et al., 2019) MBSDM CRIM Fresnel
    (Bogena et al., 2009) CRIM Near field Two stage model (Huang et al., 2020) TDR
    measurement Whole field Note: the near field and far field of antenna is determined
    using the far field distance df. df is determined by the following equation, where,
    D is the antenna dimension, λ is the signal wavelength. The second category is
    CRIM Fresnel model proposed by (Bogena et al., 2009). This is a semi-empirical
    model combining the Fresnel equation in the near field of antenna and the CDC
    model of Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM). Different from Modified Friis
    model, CRIM Fresnel is only valid in the near field of sensor node antenna. The
    third kind of propagation model is Two-stage model proposed by Huang et al. (2020).
    The two-stage model considered the field characteristic of senor node antenna
    and combined the advantages of Modified Friis model and Fresnel model. However,
    there is a fitting parameter m used to characterize the field characteristics
    is related to soil types and can hardly be determined before experiment. The three
    channels in Fig. 1 can be investigated based on single path loss models. The UG2AG
    and AG2UG channel are usually described by one model. Such models like ZS Free
    space-Modified Friis based model (Sun et al., 2011), XD Free space-Modified Friis
    based model (Dong et al., 2013) and WUSN-PLM (Sambo et al., 2020) have been reported.
    For UG2UG channel, two-path model (Vuran and Akyildiz, 2010), 3 W (3 waves) model
    (Dong and Vuran, 2011, Salam et al., 2020) and WUSN-PLM (Sambo et al., 2020) are
    reported from literatures. From the review of related works, the existing propagation
    models have some challenges in predicting the signal path loss in soils. In those
    analytical or semi-empirical models, the sensor nodes are always assumed as points
    which have the ability of transmitting or receiving wireless signals. The specific
    conditions of sensor nodes such as antenna size, antenna orientation and node
    size are neglected. Besides, the existing models are all developed in homogenous
    soils and difficult to use in heterogeneous soils. This paper aims to address
    the two shortcomings of the existing propagation models by developing a refined
    numerical model to simulate the signal propagation. 3. Numerical simulation of
    signal propagation considering detailed node structure 3.1. Numerical model setup
    in FEKO Numerical simulation of wireless signal propagation from one sensor node
    to another is a typical computational electromagnetic problem. In this paper,
    Methods of Moments (MoM) based software FEKO is chosen to simulate wireless signal
    propagation in soils. MoM solve the integral Maxwell’s equations shown as in Eq.
    (1). (1) where, E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, ρ is the electric
    charge density, J is the electric current density, μ is the media permeability,
    ε is the media permittivity, Ω is any volume with closed boundary surface ∂Ω,
    Σ is any surface with closed boundary curve ∂Σ. The integral Maxwell’s functions
    are only concerning the electric field E and magnetic field B at the boundary
    ∂Ω and ∂Σ. The investigated region is meshed only at the boundary. MoM solves
    the electric source ρ and J at the boundary by assuming basic interpolation functions
    in discretized subdomains and transform the integral Maxwell’s equations into
    linear algebra equations (Rao et al., 1982). MoM is a “source method” and very
    suitable for simulating open boundary radiating structures. Compared to “field
    methods”, such as Finite Element Method (FEM), the free-space region between the
    radiating structures do not need to discretized using MoM. Boundary conditions
    are automatically fulfilled, and memory requirements are determined by the scale
    of geometry boundary and the required solution frequency. Besides MoM, FEM is
    also incorporated into FEKO. MoM and FEM can be collaborated in the same simulation.
    Therefore, FEKO have enough accuracy and efficiency in both electrically large
    and small size problem (Jakobus and Smith, 2012). Furthermore, FEKO is capable
    of solving computational electromagnetic problems in nonhomogeneous media. 3.1.1.
    The structure of sensor node for WUSN The sensor node for WUSN is different from
    that for WSN due to the change of working environment. The signal frequency of
    EM wave is lowered to reduce the path loss in soils. The previous works show that
    433 MHz is the optimal frequency to minimize the signal path loss for WUSN (Li
    et al., 2007). The antenna size is then determined according to the signal operating
    frequency. The monopole antenna is widely used for wireless sensor node as it
    is the simplest omnidirectional antenna. The largest linear dimension of monopole
    antenna can be decided as (Huang, 2021). (2) where D is the largest linear dimension
    of monopole antenna, λ is the signal wavelength which is determined by λ = c /
    f, c is the light velocity in vacuum, f is the signal frequency. The size of the
    monopole antenna with the center frequency of 433 MHz is 0.173 m obtained from
    Eq. (2). A real monopole antenna is illustrated in Fig. 2. Download : Download

    frequency, the structure of sensor node for WUSN is unlike that for WSN. Fig.
    3 is the prototype of buried wireless sensor node developed by Tongji University
    and Wisen Innovation Ltd together. The sensor node is composed of fours parts:
    antenna is responsible for transmitting and receiving signals; sensor board is
    responsible for sensing and processing; battery is the energy source for the whole
    system; coaxial feeder connects the antenna to sensor board. The four parts are
    encapsulated in a PVC box for the isolation of the surrounding soils and underground
    water. Any other types of buried sensor node may have different structures, the
    basic four parts are generally needed. The refined numerical simulation of this
    paper will be all founded on the prototype given in Fig. 3. Download : Download

    the sensor node According to the detailed structure of buried sensor node, the
    numerical model is developed in FEKO as shown in Fig. 4. The PVC box has a dimension
    of 200 mm in length, 120 mm in width and 80 mm in height. The thickness of the
    PVC box is 5 mm. The PVC box is modelled as a hollow cuboid in FEKO using the
    given dimensions. The material of PVC is electrically simulated using a dielectric
    medium with the dielectric constant of 4.0 while it has zero electrical conductivity.
    EM waves reflect and refract at the air-box and soil-box interface. Therefore,
    wireless signal has attenuation when transmits through the PVC box and this attenuation
    is denoted as Pbox. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Numerical model of sensor node developed in FEKO. The
    sensor board is modelled as a rectangular perfect electrical conductor (PEC) with
    a size of 87.6 mm × 88.9 mm. The sensor board is served as the ground plane for
    the monopole antenna. Ideally, the monopole antenna is equivalent to a dipole
    antenna if the ground plane is infinite (Huang, 2021). For the finite sensor board
    inside a real sensor node, the length and width make a difference to the antenna
    characteristics. The signal attenuation caused by sensor board compared to an
    ideal dipole antenna is denoted as Pboard. The monopole antenna is modelled using
    a PEC cylinder with a radius of 2.5 mm and length of 173 mm. The antenna is connected
    to sensor board via coaxial feeder. Coaxial feeder is composed of inner conductor,
    outer conductor and an insulating layer between two conductors. The inner conductor
    is connected to the sensor board on one end and to the monopole antenna on the
    other end as shown in Fig. 5. The waveguide port is adopted to excite the coaxial
    feeder in the numerical model. The waveguide port is located at the end surface
    of insulating layer. EM wave is guided inside the insulating layer limited by
    surrounding two conductors once the port is excited. As the coaxial feeder is
    connected to antenna, EM wave is then radiated into the space via the monopole
    antenna. Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Modelling of the coaxial feeder. Batteries takes up a large space
    inside the sensor node due to the great desire of power. Four batteries are modelled
    as four same cylinders in the used prototype. The dimension of each battery is
    15.5 mm in radius and 61 mm in height. The surfaces of the cylinders are modelled
    as PEC as the surface of battery is made by conductive metal. The existence of
    four batteries will affect the signal propagation and batteries induced signal
    attenuation is denoted as Pbattery. After the geometry modelling of the sensor
    node, mesh is needed to perform computational electromagnetic calculation. Fig.
    6 shows the mesh of the sensor node in FEKO. Four global mesh sizes: Fine, Standard,
    Coarse and Custom can be chosen for the mesh. Triangle element is adopted as the
    Method of Moments will be used in the simulation. An auto mesh technique is employed
    in FEKO once the global mesh size is decided for simulation. As shown in Fig.
    6, the auto mesh technique has a very good adaptability for different distance
    to the port. Mesh is automatically densified near the port while gradually become
    coarse with the increasing of the distance to the port. The mesh has 6765 triangle
    elements overall for one sensor node at the coarse mesh size level as shown in
    Fig. 6(a). If the global mesh size is set as standard level, the total mesh elements
    will expand to 11,985 as given in Fig. 6(b). From the comparison of different
    global mesh size level, the mesh size near the port is the same and the mesh size
    is smaller at the far distance to the port for standard mesh level. The solution
    method is MoM with surface equivalence principle for the whole numerical model.

    Numerical modelling of the signal propagation between two nodes Fig. 7 gives the
    overview of how the wireless signal propagation between two sensor nodes are modelled
    in FEKO. Sensor Node1 and Node2 are placed at a certain signal propagation distance
    in the vertical direction. The distance between two ports is denoted as the node
    distance d. Take the signal transmits from Node1 and receives at Node2 as example
    to illustrate the propagation process. A waveguide excitation is given to the
    port 1 of Node 1. The antenna of Node1 transforms the excitation into EM waves
    and radiating into the surrounding space. Once the antenna of Node2 receives the
    radiating EM waves, it transforms the EM waves into excitation. This excitation
    can be received by port 2 of Node2. The total signal attenuation, namely path
    loss, can be obtained from analyzing the energy difference of the two ports. S-parameter
    S21 measures the energy difference between port 1 and port 2. FEKO can solve the
    scattering problem and directly output the S-parameter. Download : Download high-res

    and receiving mechanism between two nodes. Ground is introduced into the model
    covering the two nodes and the ground is modelled as homogenous dielectric lossy
    medium. Equivalent complex dielectric constant εeff (ε′-jε″) are key parameters
    to model the dielectric and lossy behavior of soils. In real-life application,
    ground is infinite in dimension. However, the numerical model cuts off at the
    boundaries to make the simulation possible. A cylinder boundary is chosen in this
    paper. The boundary conditions are automatically fulfilled as the MoM is adjusted
    from Boundary Element Method (BEM). The horizontal distance of the sensor node
    to the model boundary is r and distance to top or bottom boundary is h as shown
    in Fig. 8 (a). Mesh of the numerical model is given in Fig. 8 (b) from a cut plane
    view. Automatic mesh technique and coarse mesh size level are adopted in the simulation.
    Mesh of soil ground could be much coarser than the buried sensor node without
    the sacrifice of solving accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (278KB)

    for wireless signal propagation in soils. It is easy to see that model boundary
    is crucial for the reasonability and applicability of developed numerical model.
    Fig. 9 aims to investigate the boundary effect on the simulated signal path loss
    for soils with variated electrical properties and different node distance. Fig.
    9 tells that the distance of buried sensor node to the top and bottom boundary
    h does not the influence the signal path loss. Therefore, the h value is set as
    0.6 m for the consideration of computational cost. The radius r of the numerical
    model has an obvious effect on the path loss. To obtain a stable model response,
    r value needs to be large enough. From the four groups of calculation in Fig.
    9, the minimum value of a required model radius is correlated to the signal wavelength
    in soils λc. λc is determined as follows (Shi et al., 2021), (3) where, β is the
    phase shifting constant of soil, which is determined by (Akyildiz et al., 2009)
    (4) where, f is the signal frequency, μ is the magnetic permeability in soils
    which equals to the magnetic permeability in vacuum μ0, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric
    constant, ε′ is the real part of relative complex dielectric constant of soils,
    ε″ is the imaginary part of relative complex dielectric constant of soils. The
    input parameters are the signal frequency, soil equivalent relative complex dielectric
    constant ε. Four different signal wavelengths are considered in Fig. 9 from 0.116
    m to 0.276 m for f = 0.433 GHz. Compared to the wavelength in free space λ0, the
    soil wavelength λc is reduced. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download

    The determination of model boundary is shown in Table 2 obtained from the numerical
    tests. The minimum model radius rmin to arrive a stable signal path loss is determined
    if the change of path loss is smaller than 0.5 dB. Then the ratio of rmin over
    λc can be calculated as given in Table 2. For soil type (a), (b) and (c), rmin
    / λc is the in the range of 4.3–4.5. For soil type (d), rmin/λc = 2.8. Considering
    all the four cases, it is appropriate to set the value of rmin / λc as 5. Therefore,
    the numerical model radius can be determined as r = 5λc. Table 2. Determination

    equation The developed refined numerical model is first compared to Friis equation
    in free space. Friis transmission equation calculates the wireless signal path
    loss in free space as follows (Li et al., 2007), (5) where, Lp is the signal path
    loss in dB, d is the sight-of-line distance between transmitter and receiver in
    meters, f is the wireless signal frequency in Hertz. Fig. 10 (a) shows the total
    signal path loss from Port 1 of Node 1 to Port 2 of Node 2 in free space obtained
    by refined numerical model. Three signal operation frequencies, 433 MHz, 868 MHz
    and 2.4 GHz are considered in the numerical simulation. The total signal path
    loss Lp,total is composed of two parts: the free space path loss L0 and sensor
    node itself induced path loss Lnode as expressed by Eq. (6). (6) Download : Download

    by node distance and signal operating frequency. Node induced path loss is irrelevant
    to node distance and only determined by node detailed structure and signal frequency.
    Therefore, Lnode and L0 can be separated from Lp,total as Lnode is a constant
    for different signal transmission distance. The separated L0 from refined numerical
    simulation is compared to the Friis transmission equation in Fig. 10 (b). The
    simulation results by refined numerical model well agrees with the theoretical
    Friis equation in free space at different node distances and signal frequencies.
    The separated Lnode is 34.3 dB for 433 MHz, 17.0 dB for 868 MHz and 6.9 dB for
    2.4 GHz. This fully accounts for the importance of Lnode in calculating Lp,total.
    The comparison clearly shows that Friis equation can only give the signal path
    loss in free space. Friis equation does not consider the detailed structure of
    sensor node and therefore cannot predict the node induced path loss. The developed
    refined numerical model simulates the signal propagation from the waveguide port
    and obtain the total signal path loss from transmitter to receiver. 3.2.2. Model
    validation in soils using outdoor experiments Outdoor experiments of EM wave propagation
    in soils were conducted to validate the developed numerical model. Only a brief
    introduction of the signal transmission experiment is given here as it is not
    the focus of this paper. More details can be found in another published paper
    (Huang et al., 2020). The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 11. The experiment
    system was composed of two wireless sensor nodes, one gateway and one laptop.
    Node 1 was buried at the bottom of the hole and Node 2 was placed at the surface
    of the backfilled soil. The distance between Node 1 and Node 2 was changed as
    the covering soil increased. At each time interval, sensor nodes formed a mesh
    topology and send data to the sink node. Sensor node 2 received the signal sent
    by Node 1, recorded the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Index) and transferred
    this information to the sink node. The sink node transmitted the mesh information
    to the remote sever via the mobile network and signal path loss could be easily
    obtained if both the transmitting and receiving power were measured. Download

    Setup of outdoor experiment for signal propagation. Four groups of experiments
    with three types of soils were conducted. The physical and electrical properties
    of the backfilled soils were given in Table 3. Two groups of experiments using
    silty clay were conducted and one group of experiment was conducted for wet sand
    and dry sand respectively. Table 3. Physical and electrical properties of the
    soils used in experiments (Huang et al., 2020). Soil Type ρb ρs VWC σ Soil particle

    the temperature is kept around 19 °C. The experiment results of signal path loss
    are compared with the numerical simulation in Fig. 12. The RMSE (Root Mean Squared
    Error) and the maximum error are used to evaluate the agreement of numerical simulation
    results with experiment data. The RMSE is 3.4 dB and maximum error is 6.1 dB for
    “Silty clay-1”. The RMSE is 3.4 dB and maximum error is 5.7 dB for “Silty clay-2”.
    The RMSE is 3.0 dB and maximum error is 5.2 dB for “Dry sand”. For group of wet
    sand, the numerical results underestimate the signal path loss compared to experiment
    results at a short node distance. The maximum error is 14.9 dB for the numerical
    results. The deviation in the wet sand group is possibly caused by the inhomogeneous
    of wet sand in the vertical direction. But the deviation between numerical and
    experiment results are decreasing with the increase of node distance. The numerical
    results still agree with the experiment results at a large node distance. The
    RMSE for the group of “Wet sand” is 6.5 dB. Download : Download high-res image

    simulation and outdoor experiment results. The signal path loss for silty clay
    is much larger than that for sand both from the numerical simulation and experiment
    results. It indicates the soil types have an important effect on the soil electrical
    properties as given in Table 3 and make a big difference to the signal path loss
    eventually. From the comparison of numerical simulation results with Friis equation
    in free space and outdoor experiment results in soils, the refined numerical model
    developed in this paper is proved valid. 3.3. Comparison with the previous models
    A comparison between the proposed numerical model with the previous analytical
    models are provided in this section. Two presentative analytical propagation models
    are chosen for the comparison. 3 W model proposed by Dong and Vuran (2011) and
    WUSN-PLM model proposed by Sambo et al. (2020) are compared with numerical model
    for UG2UG channel as seen in Fig. 13(a). The experiment data is from the literature
    (Dong and Vuran, 2011). The transmitter and receiver were all buried at a depth
    of 0.4 m. The soil in the experiment contained 31% of sand, 29% of clay and VWC
    = 20%. In the near field (0–1 m), the 3 W model overestimates the signal path
    loss while numerical model and WUSN-PLM underestimate the path loss compared to
    the experiment data. In the far field (d > 1 m), the numerical model agrees well
    with WUSN-PLM and has a larger signal path loss prediction than the 3 W model.
    There is no more experiment data in the far field region. Therefore, the models
    are further compared in the far field region in Fig. 13(b) for UG2UG channel.
    The effect of node burial depth is investigated. It is found that WUSN-PLM does
    not consider the lateral waves and overestimate the signal path loss when d >
    4.5 m. The proposed numerical model predicts a signal fluctuation caused by the
    coupling effects of reflected wave and direct wave when node distance is relatively
    small. This kind of coupling is influenced by the node burial depth and node distance.
    When the node distance is large enough, the prediction by numerical model has
    an identical tendency with 3 W model. Download : Download high-res image (596KB)

    propagation models. For UG2AG channel, the proposed numerical model is also compared
    with the analytical model by Dong et al. (2013) and WUSN-PLM. The underground
    node is buried 0.5 m below the ground and the aboveground node is placed 0.5 m
    above the ground. The investigated soil contains 50% of sand particles, 15% of
    clay particles and VWC = 5%. The horizontal internode distance d is variated to
    observe the different model predictions as shown in Fig. 13(c). The WUSN-PLM agrees
    well with Dong’s model if η = 2.0 for UG2AG model. And the numerical model behaves
    more like Dong’s model if η = 3.5. The proposed numerical model has more flexibility
    to simulate the signal path loss for different channels compared to analytical
    models. 4. Parametric studies In the applications of WUSN in underground sensing,
    severe installation environments such the soil water content variation with time
    (Dong and Vuran, 2013, Salam and Vuran, 2016), soil heterogeneity will challenge
    the performance of network connectivity. Furthermore, the chosen of optimal signal
    frequency is necessary to reduce the path loss (Salam et al., 2019a). During the
    installation, the node orientation also affects the signal path loss from the
    previous experiment results (Silva and Vuran, 2009, Vuran and Silva, 2010). Therefore,
    these factors are parametrically studied in this section to provide some guidance
    for the design and installation of WUSN. 4.1. Influence of soil physical properties
    Soil physical properties affects the signal path loss through their influence
    on soil CDC. The soil equivalent relative complex dielectric constants εeff for
    homogeneous soil is predicted by MBSDM (Mironov et al., 2009). The input parameters
    are the clay particle percentages C, soil VWC and signal frequency f. MBSDM is
    believed to have a better prediction of soil complex dielectric constants and
    fewer input parameters compared to other CDC models (Sambo et al., 2020). The
    node distance is fixed at 1.0 m and signal frequency is 433 MHz for this parametric
    study. Soil clay content C and water content VWC are variated to observe their
    effects on signal path loss. Fig. 14 shows that VWC makes a big difference to
    signal path loss. And the path loss can be fitted using parabolic curves. The
    fitting results are summarized in Table 4. The curve fitting results show that
    a parabolic equation has a very good fitness to the curves as all the R2 values
    are better than 0.99. Signal path loss in soils with very low water content is
    very close. The signal path loss at mv = 0 is in the range of 56.54–57.22 dB.
    This means dry soil have similar attenuation to wireless signals. Compared to
    the 58.97 dB path loss in free space, dry soil causes very limited additional
    attenuation to signals. This can be understood from the double-layer theory of
    soil particles (Dobson et al., 1985). Dry soil has a very low electrical conductivity
    because the cations and anions precipitate as salts resulting in the shortage
    of moveable ions. In addition, absolute value of the other two fitting coefficients
    in the parabolic equation increase with the increase of clay particle fractions
    C. Signal path loss is more sensitive to VWC for soils having larger clay particle
    content compared to soils with fewer clay particle content. Download : Download

    operating frequency The path loss in free space at 1.0 m node distance is set
    as the baseline for signal propagation in soils. Four soil samples are investigated
    with different clay content and volumetric water content. The soil complex dielectric
    constants required by the numerical model are first calculated at different signal
    frequency using MBSDM. The distribution of signal path loss in soils at different
    frequencies as shown in Fig. 15 is similar to that in free space. An optimal frequency
    foptimal exists to minimize the signal path loss. Before the optimal frequency,
    signal path loss decreases rapidly with the increase of signal frequency. After
    the optimal frequency, signal path loss increases with the increase of frequency.
    Therefore, a local minimum arrives at the optimal frequency which is in the range
    of 0.56–0.65 GHz for different soil samples. This gives practical guidance to
    the choice of signal operating frequency. The general considered center frequency
    fcenter = 0.433 GHz is far from good in our analysis. The path loss at optimal
    frequency can reduce about 21%–24% compared to the path loss at designed center
    frequency. Download : Download high-res image (196KB) Download : Download full-size

    soil samples do not influence the distribution of signal path loss over frequency.
    The influence of soil physical parameters on optimal frequency is less than 0.1
    GHz, which can be very useful in choosing the optimal signal operating frequency
    for different application scenarios. 4.3. Influence of relative node installation
    place In real-life application of WUSN, the relative node installation place between
    two sensors affects the signal propagation. The relative node installation place
    between two sensor nodes is illustrated in Fig. 16 (a). The relative rotation
    angle is used to quantify the possible installation deviation. Numerical results
    in Fig. 16 (b) shows that the relative rotation angle has a nonnegligible effect
    on signal path loss. Signal path loss arrives at a local maximum value when the
    rotation angle is 90° and 270°, and path loss arrives at a local minimum when
    the rotation angle is 0°, 180° and 360°. Therefore, it is the most unfavorable
    condition for signal propagation if two nodes are placed in the perpendicular
    direction while it is the most favorable condition if the two nodes are placed
    in the parallel direction. The difference of signal path loss in the perpendicular
    direction and parallel direction is up to 33.8 dB for d = 0.5 m, 37.8 dB for d
    = 1.0 m and 39.2 dB for d = 2.0 m. Download : Download high-res image (241KB)

    between two sensor nodes on the signal path loss. Another observation from Fig.
    16 is that a small rotation angle deviation from the parallel direction (0°, 180°)
    does not cause a big increase of the signal path loss. Signal path loss only increase
    0.3 dB when the rotation angle deviates ±15° from 180°, and it increases 1.4 dB
    when the rotation angle deviates ±30° from 180°. The signal path loss only increases
    2% in the rotation angle range of ±30°. This allows enough installation error
    in the real application. 4.4. Influence of water content variation induced soil
    heterogeneity Natural soils are usually inhomogeneous due to the formation histories
    and outside influence from ground surface such as the increase of water content
    induced by rainfall. Such inhomogeneity is especially obvious in the vertical
    direction. In order to quantitatively investigate the effect of soil inhomogeneity
    on signal path loss, a vertical variated water content is assumed as shown in
    Fig. 17. The soil bulk density and particle density are set as ρb = 1.4 g/cm3
    and ρs = 2.7 g/cm3 with a porosity of 0.481. The soil volumetric water content
    (VWC) is assumed linearly distributed in the vertical direction. VWC = 0.0 at
    the ground surface and VWC = 0.3 at a depth of 2.0 m. Download : Download high-res
    image (79KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 17. Assumed soil vertical
    inhomogeneity induced by variation of water content. Confronted with the assumed
    vertically inhomogeneous soil, analytical propagation models have great difficulties
    in predicting signal path loss in such soils. However, the numerical model has
    advantages in solving such problems. Fig. 18 gives a simplified strategy for the
    simulation of vertically inhomogeneous soil through layered approximation. The
    investigated region is divided into several layers to approximate the linearly
    increased VWC along the burial depth. Each layer is assumed to be homogeneous
    with an equivalent VWC. The equivalent VWC of each layer is determined by the
    center point of that layer. With the increase of soil layers, the layer thickness
    is gradually reduced and the approximation is approaching the initial problem.
    For the specific case provided in Fig. 17, four simulation schemes including 1
    layer, 4 fours, 8 layers and 16 layers are designed. Download : Download high-res

    modelling of soil inhomogeneity. UG2AG channel is investigated for heterogenous
    soils as shown in Fig. 19. The aboveground node is 0.4 m above the ground surface.
    The underground node is in the same vertical alignment with the aboveground node
    and the buried depth is variated in the range of 0.2 m–2.0 m. If the whole region
    is considered as one homogeneous layer, the signal path loss for UG2AG channel
    is larger than several layers. With the number of layers increasing, the signal
    path loss is converged according to the tendency observed from Fig. 19. Signal
    path loss in layered soils is more complex than it is in homogeneous soil due
    to the coupling of direct waves and reflected waves. The coupling of different
    waves could increase or reduce the path loss. Thus, the signal path loss is fluctuated
    with the increase of burial depth. But there is still an obvious linear tendency
    of signal path loss. Applying linear regression to each curve, the linear coefficient
    Pα can be obtained. The linear coefficient Pα in dB/m accounts for the signal
    path loss induced by soil absorption. Pα = 27.3 for one layer, Pα = 37.4 for four
    layers, Pα = 34.0 for eight layers, Pα = 37.6 for sixteen layers. Both the signal
    path loss fluctuation and tendency show the difference between homogenous and
    heterogenous soils. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download

    soil. UG2UG channel is also studied in heterogenous soils as shown in Fig. 20.
    The transmitter and receiver are buried at the same depth ht = hr. The node horizontal
    distance d is in the range of 0.2–3.0 m. Sixteen layers simulation scheme is adopted
    to modelling the soil heterogenous. Three node burial depth ht = 0.2 m, 0.4 m
    and 0.6 m are chosen for the simulation. The results show that the fluctuation
    of signal path loss is larger than that in homogenous soils. Signal propagation
    is much more complex due to the wave reflection and refraction between different
    layers. With the increase of node burial depth ht, the fluctuation period and
    amplitude decreases. The linear coefficient does not vary much for each case.
    Pα = 18.7 for ht = 0.2 m, Pα = 17.1 for ht = 0.4 m, Pα = 15.1 for ht = 0.6 m.
    The fluctuation of signal path loss makes it more difficult for analytical models
    to give an accurate prediction. The linear coefficient for UG2AG and UG2UG shows
    that signal propagation along the vertical direction is much more difficult than
    horizontal direction. The numerical simulation shows the soil heterogeneity has
    unfavorable effect on signal propagation. Therefore, the transmitter and receiver
    are suggested to install in homogeneous soils or at least in the same soil layer.

    Fig. 20. Signal path loss of UG2UG channel in heterogeneous soil. 5. Conclusions
    This paper develops a refined numerical model to simulate the wireless signal
    propagation in soils for WUSN. The structure details of the buried sensor node
    have been considered in the numerical model developed in FEKO. The proposed numerical
    model considers the attenuation caused by the sensor node itself. Furthermore,
    the proposed model allows the investigation of soil inhomogeneity, which is difficult
    for analytical signal propagation models. Several points are concluded as follows:
    (1) The refined numerical model considering the detailed structure of buried sensor
    node can obtain the total signal path loss in soils. Signal loss caused by sensor
    node itself is clarified by the comparison with Friis equation. For the specific
    node shown in this paper, the additional loss is 34.3 dB. The additional loss
    is determined by the node structure and signal frequency. (2) At low water content,
    signal path loss is not sensitive to soil clay content. Path loss is at the same
    level for signal propagates in dry soils. At high water content, clay content
    makes a big difference to signal path loss. For different types of soils, the
    path loss can be expressed as a parabolic function of soil volumetric water content.
    The fitting parameters are determined by soil clay content. (3) An optimal frequency
    foptimal exists to minimize the path loss given the antenna size. foptimal is
    not equal to the center frequency of antenna. Soil physical properties has limited
    influence to the optimal frequency. foptimal is in the range of 0.56–0.65 GHz
    for antenna size D = 17.3 cm. (4) Signal path loss of two sensors installed in
    the parallel direction (relative rotation angle 0°, 180°) is the local minimum
    while it is the local maximum for sensors installed in the perpendicular direction
    (relative rotation angle 90°, 270°). A deviation of ±30° from the parallel direction
    only causes a 1.4 dB increase of signal path loss. (5) The proposed numerical
    model is able to simulate signal propagation in heterogeneous soils. Layered approximation
    is adopted to simulate the heterogeneous soils with linear increase water content
    along depth. With the increase of equivalent layers, the signal path loss converges.
    For a region with 2 m deep, division by 16 homogenous layers are a good approximation.
    The coupling of direct, reflected and refracted waves could increase or decrease
    the path loss and lead to the fluctuation. The fluctuation of signal path loss
    makes the prediction more difficult for analytical models. CRediT authorship contribution

    attacks; challenges and future prospective 1. Introduction IoT has limited processing
    capability and a low-power network of sensing devices that interchange data with
    each other, such as cloud servers and gateways, usually via wireless or wired
    technologies. The use of IoT devices is increasing, and it is estimated that by
    the end of 2030, the number of connected devices will reach around 24.1 billion
    [1]. However, progress in the IoT has highlighted security concerns. Considering
    the variety of IoT topologies and the abundance of sensing and communication modules
    they incorporate, integrating such devices leads to a dynamic and varied landscape
    [1,2]. Actually, IoT devices are considered and, in some cases, known to be vulnerable
    to network attacks, such as spoofing, data theft, denial of service attacks (DDoS
    attacks), and phishing attacks [3]. According to a lab study, nearly 30% of attacks
    on IoT devices occur on wireless or mobile technology devices [4]. In several
    situations, IoT device security is handled by the device’s own application [5].
    For instance, it has been shown that battery-powered wearable, handheld, and portable
    gadgets frequently sacrifice security performance in order to support longer working
    times. Although energy-efficient communication and control protocols for IoT have
    been developed to address these problems, vulnerabilities associated with these
    protocols may still be present. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) affects a wide range
    of IoT devices and is widely used for industrial IoT (IIoT) and wearable devices.
    Basically, IIoT is the extension of IoT in industry. Focusing on machine learning,
    machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, big data, and IIoT-capable enterprises,
    industries will have suitable reliability and efficiency in operation. The interaction
    of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) marks a distinction
    between IoT and IIOT [6,7]. IIoT systems are more vulnerable to advanced persistent
    threat (APT) adversary assaults than conventional industrial control systems (ICS)
    and OT networks because of IT network connectivity and the introduction of M2M,
    which connects different intelligent and latest devices. In addition, ICS devices
    often work on legacy (without a security mind) or unaware (no updates from time
    to time) software. Attackers or “Evil Eyes” usually target ICS-related information
    to gather intelligence that can shut down critical systems, endanger human lives,
    and disrupt industrial processes. In the past, such attacks have occurred in the
    real world; hence, we can say they were real-world attacks (RWA). Examples include
    Iran’s uranium Stuxnet attack in 2010 that caused a sufficient setback to Iran’s
    nuclear program and damaged their centrifuge [8]; the German steel mill attack
    in 2014 that caused significant loss (the mill avoided blast burning from shutting
    down) [9]; the power company attack in Ukraine in 2015 that detached small-level
    stations from the power grid, leaving millions of customers without power for
    a long time [10]; the similar attack in Ukraine in 2016 on transmission-level
    substations that disconnected capital without power for more than an hour [11];
    and the attacks on the petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia in 2017 that shut down
    the safety controller of the plant which could have caused massive loss, damage,
    or an explosion [12]. Industry, the malware behind the power grid attack in Ukraine
    in 2016 and the Saudi petrochemical attack in 2017 are still active in targeting
    energy sectors and electrical power substations [13,14]. In-controller IIoT malware
    that was recently revealed in 2022 consists of modules that hit particular ICS
    devices such as Schneider Electric PLCs using Modbus, open platform communication
    (OPC) servers, Codesys protocols, and Ormon PLCs. The energy, critical manufacturing,
    water/wastewater, and commercial sector are the major sectors affected by cyber
    attacks, as shown in flow chart Figure 1, while the US Department of Home Security
    considers the water and waste industry to be the main target of cyber attacks
    [15]. Securing it [16,17] is considered to be a national priority [18]. From 2012
    to 2015, this industry received the most assessments from the Cybersecurity and
    Infrastructure Security Agency Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
    Team [18]. Recently, in August 2022, a criminal attack on a UK water company was
    observed which gained access to customer banking details [19]. Cybersecurity has
    developed a huge interest in the water industry and some educational programs
    have been offered [20,21]. This provoked great interest in the research environment
    [22,23,24,25,26,27], as earlier cybersecurity incidents may have provided insightful
    information that could be used to inform current cyber defense efforts, promoting
    investments and initiatives and increasing their applicability and efficiency.
    This calls for a thorough compilation and analysis of these instances, which is
    currently lacking. This study presents a study of water industry vulnerabilities
    and security, a review of malicious, documented, and disclosed cybersecurity attacks
    in the water industry, and safety guidelines or tips. This review also presents
    the challenges and future prospective analyses from real-world water industry
    attacks. Figure 2 represents the paper’s architecture. This study highlights the
    attacker’s role and “proof” in water purification and distribution plants. According
    to a study in 2021, the average instance of cybersecurity and data breaches will
    eventually be 15% yearly [28]. As of the time at which we wrote this review, there
    has been no research that provides a comprehensive study of security issues, vulnerabilities,
    and real-world cases in water distribution and purification plants. This review
    is new, and we hope to maximize researchers interest. Figure 1. Cyber attacks
    in various industries [29] (vulnerabilities). Figure 2. Paper architecture. The
    rest of the paper has been organized as follows: Section 2 concerns the comparative
    evaluation of previous surveys. In Section 3, we discuss the architecture of the
    industrial control system. Section 4 contains a discussion of secure water treatment
    plant components and processes, as well as the methods by which an attacker could
    gain access to a plant. In Section 5, we discuss the attack and defense model
    in the ICS environment. Section 6 concerns attacks on water purification and distribution
    plants in real-world scenarios. In Section 7, we discuss the vulnerabilities,
    challenges, and future of water purification and distribution plants, while Section
    8 concerns cyber saftey tips in IIot. In Section 9, we discuss security in water
    purification and distribution plants, and our conclusions are given in Section
    10. 2. Previous Surveys IoT is a technology that links physical devices through
    a wired or wireless network, and IIoT is a technology that deals with complicated
    architecture and is linked with the hardware and software in the industry. Actuators
    and sensors play an important role in data transmission and communication in an
    ICS environment such as industrial architecture. The authors of [30] studied IoT
    problems and challenges, but their work is limited, and the authors did not explain
    the applications of IoT or the role of IoT in the industrial domain. IoT-based
    applications have been studied in [31], in which the authors presented a general
    review of IoT-based applications. This work is useful for researchers in understanding
    the IoT applications and the advancement of the technology, but the authors did
    not discuss security issues or future perspectives in this work. Moreover, very
    few IoT applications were discussed. IoT advancement from various perspectives
    such as social impacts, applications, and challenges has been studied in [32,33].
    The work is far from a discussion of security issues and future challenges in
    IoT. A review has been presented in [34] which is IoT-based but limited to healthcare
    applications. Future research on green IoT has been discussed in [35]. With the
    development of technology and IoT’s role in connectivity, industrial IoT (IIoT)
    has been playing an important role in academia and industry. The authors of [36,37]
    presented a review on IIoT, and they explained the interaction of IoT with IIoT.
    A security review of IoT has been discussed in [38], but the authors did not present
    their work from the perspective of applications and cases. The authors of [39]
    studied emerging technologies in the IIoT, and their work explained the experimental
    and conceptual architecture of IIoT. IIoT has been reviewed from a business perspective
    in [40]. Security is a key issue in an ICS environment, and researchers are doing
    their best to identify and overcome these issues. The authors of [41] presented
    a review of security in ICS. Research shows that there is insufficient attention
    being paid to the patch management process because of SCADA complications. The
    authors presented several security issues and SCADA assessments, but in this work,
    the authors were to able to highlight maximum security issues in an ICS environment
    and solutions. An ICS environment covers several applications, such as the chemical
    industry, oil and gas, water and wastewater treatment, agriculture, and many others.
    Our focus is on cyber security in water and wastewater treatment plants. Water
    is a basic element of life. It is considered one of the major sectors affected
    by cyberattacks. Researchers’ contributions are playing an important role in raising
    awareness of such issues. The role of IoT in water distribution systems has been
    studied in [42]. The authors of [43] presented a review of cyber security in water
    treatment plants, and they also discussed real cases in water treatment plants.
    The authors discussed fifteen real-life cases in the water purification and distribution
    industry. The authors discussed the attacker’s methods and vulnerabilities in
    the system, but their work did not explain the latest cyberattack incidents in
    the water industry, and there is also insufficient discussion of the future prospects
    in the water and wastewater industry. The authors of [22] presented a systematic
    review of cyber security in the critical infrastructure of water and wastewater
    treatment plants. The authors discussed future research work, but they did not
    study real cases and the attackers’ means of entering the water plant’s communication
    network. Their work also did not explain the key challenges and vulnerabilities
    in the system. A study has been presented in [44] that explains the water distribution
    [45] system while ignoring the security aspects involved in distribution. Cyberattack
    mitigation in an ICS environment has been studied in [46]. The authors of [47]
    presented a review of cyber attacks and detection methods in water purification
    plants. The survey is based on general cyber attacks and common attack detection
    methods and it does not cover the latest research and incidents in water purification
    plants. The work also fails to present the vulnerabilities in the system. These
    surveys show insufficient knowledge of cyber security in water distribution and
    purification plants. There are recent incidents in water purification and distribution
    plants that have not been discussed in these surveys. Moreover, attacker entranceways
    and system vulnerabilities have not been discussed in previous surveys. Very few
    of the previous works dedicated space to future prospects, and none covered the
    subject extensively. At the time of writing this manuscript, there has been no
    survey on attack detection in water purification and distribution plants. In previous
    surveys, significant information has been missing regarding the security of water
    purification and distribution plants. The current survey will therefore be very
    useful and informative, offering maximum information and knowledge for researchers
    and industrialists. We provide a comparison with previous surveys in Table 1.
    Table 1. Comparative analysis with previous related surveys. 3. Industrial Control
    System (ICS) In this section, we provide work on the integration of IT with traditional
    OT networks and the general architecture considered for ICS networks. We will
    also discuss adhering to this ICS architecture when we discuss real-world incidents
    in water treatment plants. Usually, an ICS architecture consists of software and
    hardware components, which are known as supervisory control and data acquisition
    (SCADA) for systemic monitoring, process control, ICS device communication, data
    collection, log data storage, and system monitoring. In a typical SCADA system,
    the lowest level consists of dumb devices, also called field devices, such as
    sensors, actuators, etc. Remote terminal units (RTU) and programmable logic controllers
    (PLC) are used to control these devices. Generally, RTU and PLC are computer-based
    systems that give control signals to field devices, obtain data, and send it to
    central control stations such as the master terminal unit (MTU). The MTU communicates
    in a master-slave model via a telephone network, wireless or wired network, or
    the internet for monitoring the field devices, uploading fresh or updated configurations,
    and sending commands. All such operations are managed by the human–machine interface
    (HMI) that is linked to the MTU and permits gathering data, transferring signals
    to remote sites, and varying configurations and settings. An old water distribution
    system architecture is shown in Figure 3a with PLC and RTU distributed sites.
    In this simple network, we discussed various layers of SCADA architecture in which
    field devices such as pressure gauges and valves are under the monitoring of RTU
    through a wireless system, while the role of SCADA is that of a central control
    station, such as the head of the ICS network, and it is in communication with
    PLC and RTU in the environment. Figure 3. (a) Old architecture of a water distribution
    system. (b) Architecture of a water purification and distribution system. Previously,
    there was an air gap between the SCADA system and traditional OT system networks,
    which were not interlinked with the IT system. With the advancement of technology,
    several industries moved to overlap the IT and OT network, which is known as the
    cost-effective approach. On the one hand, this approach is considered cost-effective
    and time-saving; on the other hand, there seems to be serious security threats
    involved in this approach, for the following reasons: There are different operational
    priorities of OT and IT networks, such as availability vs. confidentiality, and
    both may not adjust; Several ICSs lack security features such as access control
    and data encryption; There are limited visualization options for implementing
    and assessing security adjustments, which are provided by expensive legacy devices
    in ICS setups; The immediate adoption of corrective measures that may require
    system interruptions is prohibited by the critical and real-time business activities
    in OT as well as safety rules. As a result of these security measures, some limitations
    have been suggested by security experts for access to the OT network. There are
    some other works in the ICS security field intended to enhance protocols, standards,
    and components to support security benefits. In an ICS, the development of technology
    has merged the IT and OT networks, which is known as IIoT and is without air gaps.
    Figure 4 is an ICS network architecture that consists of various zones and can
    be described as an industrial automation and control system security. Basically,
    a zone is defined as a set of devices or components (IT and OT) joined together
    for a subclass of applications in an ICS environment. Figure 4. An ICS architecture.
    4. Secure Water Treatment Plant Components and Processes, and Attacker Means of
    Access IIoT-deployed water plants or systems increase with the development of
    technologies such as monitoring and sensing technology and real-time communication
    technology such as satellite and wireless communication, intelligence, and controls.
    4.1. Components in Plant There are various components used in water purification
    plants. These are given as follows. 4.1.1. Pressure Meter This is used to detect
    a pressure leakage in the plant such as via flooding, pipe burst, or any other
    kind of irregularity. It senses and stops the flow or transportation of water.
    4.1.2. Advance Valves With the variation of environmental situations, these stop
    or regulate the water flow in the system. Smart valves permit bidirectional water
    flow and stop the reduction of water or signal the water meter to reduce the oversupply
    of water. 4.1.3. Flood Sensors These analyze the existing and impending safety
    with respect historically occurring and impending flood disasters. They stop the
    flow of water when they detect a pipe break in a source to stop water loss. 4.1.4.
    Advance Pumps To pump water via pipelines into and out of tanks, these machines
    need electricity. They permit water to flow both ways and are employed for high-energy-use
    processes and can stop a significant waste of water. 4.1.5. Digital Water Meters
    These are electrical devices that assess water consumption on a regular basis.
    Data on water use by consumers are gathered by the water utility administration
    from the smart water meters via communication networks. The information gathered
    is then utilized to calculate the cost of water consumption and manage bills.
    4.1.6. Digital Controllers These have thermostats for sprinkler systems that allow
    water to be automatically irrigated based on schedules or specific circumstances,
    which is useful in preventing wastage of water and energy occurring due to excess
    use of water. 4.1.7. Tanks These are used for the purpose of storing water received
    from external resources or from step six to three processes (see below). 4.1.8.
    Pipes These are the basic elements of water transportation. 4.1.9. Digital Contaminant
    Sensors These determine the biochemical state of the water by computing factors
    including temperature, turbidity, oxidation-reduction potential, pH, and conductivity
    to ensure purity. They can stop the aging of water, the corrosion of pipes, and
    the entry of contaminants. Cyber security in water purification and distribution
    plants is mandatory because the above-mentioned components or elements are linked
    together, connected to the internet at some point in the system, and are easy
    targets for attackers without any secure management. There are various stages
    in a secure water treatment plant, and the PLC is responsible for controlling
    each stage. Typically, two PLCs are used, with one reserved for emergency use.
    The general process of securing a water treatment plant is given in the following
    stages: Storage of raw water (received from outside) in a tank; In the second
    stage, chemicals such as HCl, NaCl, and NaOCl are added for better water quality;
    In the third stage, through ultra-filtration, the filtration process starts; In
    the fourth stage, ultraviolet light is used to dechlorinate the water; The fifth
    stage is the reverse osmosis process; In the final stage, the remaining water
    is stored in another tank, and this water can be sent to step three for the backwash
    process. 4.2. Attack Techniques Water is a basic element of life. It is challenging
    to secure a water treatment plant, but it is essential not only to secure a plant
    but to save lives connected with this plant such as those of humans, birds, animals,
    etc. Advanced and digital technology-based plants are helpful in the improvement
    of water quality and ensuring a quick supply. However, this deployment of technology
    also increases the security challenges in the process. For example, an attacker
    can attack to shut down the water supply, increase the HCl quantity, or overflow
    the tank. The attacker’s purpose is to damage the plant system. There are several
    ways that an attacker can attack a water treatment plant, as shown in Figure 5.
    Figure 5. Attacker means of accessing an ICS system. 4.2.1. Attack through Actuators
    In this type of attack, the attacker targets the actuator and provides misinformation
    concerning the water quantity to disturb the water facilities, as shown in Figure
    5. 4.2.2. Attack through PLC When an attacker targets the PLCs, it leads to the
    attacker misleading the network operation. 4.2.3. Attack through Sensors When
    an attacker attacks through the sensor, it leads to varying sensor [48] readings
    for private data. 4.2.4. Attack through a Network or Communication Layer Here,
    the attacker attacks through the communication or networking links to disturb
    or damage the system. This communication could be between PLCs, SCADA, sensors,
    actuators, and the relevant software and hardware used in communication. The authors
    of [13] studied all means of maliciously accessing a plant such as through sensors,
    actuators, networks, and PLCs, etc. In [26,27,30,31,35,36,39], the authors studied
    attacks through sensors in the environment. Ref. [28] shows an attack via an actuator
    in the plant. Refs. [31,35] also show means of attack via PLCs’ and actuators’
    communication and more than one PLC communication network. The researchers in
    [35] also represent an attack through PLCs and sensors and the PLC communication
    link, while [39] only covers attacks through sensors and actuators. Still, there
    is a lack of security management and the tools necessary for a secure system.
    5. Attack and Defense Model The real-world cyber attack cases studied in this
    review can be grasped efficiently with the understanding of attack and defense
    models. 5.1. Attack Model The primary objective of the water distribution and
    purification company is to deliver secure, safe, and pure water to the customers.
    Because of cyber attacks, there is a danger of disturbances to the water transportation
    system or variations of chemicals which is a very sensitive issue. A small negligence
    can cause a big loss. Attackers try to attack through the main components of the
    plant. From the perspective of the attacker, there are various stages in a systematic
    process or isolated malicious activity by which to gain access to or reach the
    target and disturb the network. The killed chain concept has been proposed by
    researchers in military applications such as weaponization, installation, reconnaissance,
    delivery command, and control action, etc. It introduced and defined the cyber
    kill chain (CKC). Taking inspiration from CKC, researchers studied a few attack
    models. In an ICS environment, the attack method is quite different because of
    the different architecture. In an ICS environment, the target can be IT, OT, or
    DMZ. In real cases, most targets are on the OT network, where attackers gain access
    to the system or network through the IT network and affect the OT system by applying
    a number of attacks. This model is known as the combined ICS kill chain and CKS.
    Here, the attacker can repeat his process to reach the target. He will move inside
    the network until the time when he accesses the target. Te authors of [49] studied
    a spiral attack model that moves inside the IT/OT network till it reaches the
    target. There are various ways for an attacker to enter the ICS environment through
    sensors, actuators, communication links, or valves, etc. Attacking sensors means
    varying the water level in the tank. The authors in [50,51] studied an experimental
    setup to explain the disturbance in the water level in an ICS environment while
    attacking through actuators to vary the data linked pumping speed and implement
    a DoS attack. Attacking via the communication link between sensors and PLC means
    varying the PLC-collected data and getting water status information; attacking
    via the actuators and PLC communication link means changing the signals and sending
    wrong information. By attacking via PLCs, attackers can acquire full control of
    the system and can easily inject a DoS attack; while the attack on sensors means
    varying the water system configuration system and changing the sensors’ collected
    data. As shown in Figure 4 the attacker may initiate suspicious activities in
    an external environment and approach an employee of the organization to insert
    or inject an attack via email or web server, and a vulnerable host can be helpful
    to reaching the target. Once an attack happens or is sent into the environment,
    the attacker is already in the network and moves slowly and safely to reach the
    target and infiltrate the control or required target. This is an example of a
    general attack; it is not mandatory that an attack be injected from level 5; an
    insider can launch an attack, such as an employee in the workstation or DMZ zone.
    As to how an attacker delivers attacks on victims, the key features are given
    as follows. 5.1.1. Adversary It is an organization that is responsible for attacks.
    It can be from inside or outside and emerge from individual activity or that of
    a group. In most cyber incidents, this is unknown. It is important to understand
    the relationship between the attacker and the customer. 5.1.2. Capability A technique
    or tool used by the hacker. The target environment’s configuration flaws and vulnerabilities
    determine an attacker’s capacity. 5.1.3. Infrastructure A logical or physical
    communication method such as email or an external device (USB, Hard drive) is
    used by the attacker to inject the attack and to control the network to attain
    the required objective. The ICS environment can be monitored, controlled, and
    attacked by the hacker when he or she injects an attack successfully. 5.1.4. Victims
    The system is targeted by the attacker for a self-directed requirement or purpose.
    The “victims” include any technical issues or vulnerabilities in the network that
    allow the attacker to penetrate and obtain control of the whole environment. Sometimes,
    an attacker attains overall control of the ICS environment, and sometimes the
    attacked gains control of some specific parts, as is often the case in water secure
    treatment plants; for example, sometimes, the attacker’s purpose is to increase
    the PH level of water or HCl in the water; sometimes, it is to overflow the tank.
    For a secure and safe environment, it is important to build a secure algorithm
    inside the system to detect the attacker’s activity or anomalies before reaching
    the target. Such an algorithm should also have the capacity to detect the major
    and minor kinds of anomalies in the world by using various sensors and different
    dimensional spaces, while there is no need for more sensors in local anomalies.
    Furthermore, there is a chance that a single attack will hit several sensors at
    once, confusing the system’s functioning. Here, we study researchers’ contributions
    to anomaly detection in water purification plants. The authors of [52] studied
    nine types of attacks within the water distribution system, and tge attacks studied
    are through PLCs, SCADA, and sensors. They also studied attack limitations and
    detection methods. A detection method has been studied in [43] for the identification
    [53] of local anomalies that affect each sensor individually and worldwide anomalies
    that use multiple sensors. Researchers in [54] studied an algorithm for the identification
    of malicious activity by actuators’ regularity and sensors’ data integrity and
    detected suspicious activities in data. Later on, they separated it from SCADA
    measurements. The authors of [55] studied intrusion detection for malicious activity
    in smart cities. The authors detected denial of service attacks (DDoS)—such attacks
    can disturb the system by flooding the system with a huge number of requests and
    trying to make it inaccessible to users. Similarly, DDoS disturbs the water purification
    system by sending a large number of requests. An algorithm for the identification
    of anomalies consisting of control, consistency, pattern recognition, and hydraulic
    system has been studied in [56]. For the detection of cyber attacks in water purification
    plants, model-based fault detection methodology has been studied in [20]. For
    attack prediction, the authors of [57] presented the long short-term memory recurrent
    neural network method for testing. There were accurate results in the provided
    data. In this method, the authors used a limited number of sensors, but it can
    be enhanced to the overall dataset in the SWaT test bed. Security experts can
    install several security tools and technologies in an organization for secure
    processes. Furthermore, experts will have access to databases, standards, benchmarks,
    and security controls. Safety from security threats is a key challenge in advanced
    and technology-equipped organizations. A valuable and basic security actions list
    has been provided by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The following are
    the controls suggested by the CIS. 5.2. Basic Controls Basic control consists
    of an inventory of software and hardware tools, controlled use of admin, and regular
    vulnerability management. They consist of an inventory of licensed and unlicensed
    devices and software, their secure configuration, regular vulnerability management,
    the controlled use of admin privileges, and keeping an eye on audit logs. 5.3.
    Foundational Controls These are internet-based controls such as email and web
    browser safety, network secure configuration, malware defence (installation, execution,
    and spread), and red ream practice. They consist of an information backup process
    that secures the firewall, wireless access control (track, prevent, and control
    wireless access), boundary defence (detection and prevention of information flow),
    data protection, etc. 5.4. Organizational Control These controls involvetraining
    programs and implementations of security awareness, incident management, and response,
    red team practice, and penetration tests. In these controls, there are application
    and software security checks, penetration tests, and red team practice. Controls
    are available in various security solutions and tools and can have different impacts
    depending on the target, such as denying or securing the hacker from accessing
    private information, detecting and attacking, minimizing the attack impact, disturbing
    or interfering with active malicious activities, containing a consensus zone deceiving
    the attacker, etc. The authors of [52] studied the various security tools and
    solutions. Network-based intrusion detection systems, anti-virus solutions, or
    host-based intrusion detection systems can be useful in the detection process
    of suspected activities. Malicious activities can be in the trust zone, which
    consists of various attack steps from delivery to actions and honeypots. Antiviruses
    are useful in detection and disruption attacks during delivery, and data execution
    protection techniques are useful in disruption mechanisms. In old or traditional
    IT-based security control, there were several OT-based security tools such as
    unidirectional gateways and data diodes, passive OT intrusion detection, passive
    tool discovery, and patch management, which are being used in the current ICS
    environment. It should be noted that each AS is designed for a specific goal but
    is patched with the OT network, not the IT network. Because several industries
    moved towards an advanced industry without changing devices or components that
    were OT patch-managed, there were several vulnerabilities by which attackers could
    gain access, such as the limitation of network interaction in the unidirectional
    gateway for IT to OT and the need for a firewall in the new concept of IT and
    OT, with limited communication regulations limited to the OT network. This is
    known as boundary defence control, and in the OT network, passive tools discovery
    is basic control. In a SCADA system, each action requires one or more security
    controls. 6. Evil Eyes on the Water Purification and Distribution Environment
    in Real-World Incidents An industrial plant consists of controllers, sensors,
    and actuators such as robotics manufacturing, power plant controllers, remote
    telemetry, management systems such as remote terminal units, and the human–machine
    interference. The interconnectivity of such a complex architecture enables the
    industrial system to exchange messages or communicate in real time, enhancing
    system control, providing sufficient real-time awareness, and enhancing efficiency
    and productivity. In an industrial control system (ICS), devices—opposite to the
    operating system—are responsible for improving system efficiency, productivity,
    monitoring, and controlling the system. To meet basic security objectives, ICS
    device operation requires confirmation of in-transit data, confidentiality of
    sensed measurement, surety of secure stored information integration, and access
    only to trusted parties. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) are
    known as the basic principles of security investigation in an ICS sector. Indeed,
    the confidentiality of stored data in plants is crucial to the ICS sector. In
    an IIoT automation environment consisting of critical infrastructure such as chemical
    plants, water plants, nuclear plants, energy plants, etc., since they can result
    in catastrophic events or uneconomical plant operation, the integrity of the sensed
    data and the availability of system resources are of the utmost importance. Because
    of the distinct security objectives of ICS plants and the heterogeneous and interoperable
    architectures of the ICS sector, comprehensive security research is required in
    order to to evaluate IIoT security challenges with RWA examples for the best understanding
    and motivation of incoming researchers. Some of the incidents, their objectives,
    and limitations are given in Table 2. Table 2. Cyber attacks in water and wastewater
    distribution and purification systems. IIoT systems combine IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT
    technologies. So that they may operate effectively in a distributed manner and
    be monitored and controlled from far-flung areas, IIoT systems can make use of
    enhanced networking capabilities. This connectivity may cause vulnerabilities;
    however, in the case of insecure IIoT systems, adversaries can use them to their
    advantage by breaching industrial networks or distant connections through the
    Internet. Additionally, attacks can be carried out by accessing compromised industrial
    staff accounts and abusing their rights. In several industries, attacks have been
    reported in which either attackers directly attack IIOT systems, such as IIoT
    device attacks, or they are compromised as a result of the interconnectivity of
    IT and IIoT systems, in which case attacks travel from IT systems to IIoT devices.
    In this section, we will discuss some real-world attacks and some lab validations
    derived from the industrial domain. Figure 3b represents a water purification
    and distribution plant. 6.1. RWA in Water Industry/Plant Water is an essential
    component of life. The water and wastewater sector (WWS) is known as one of the
    most targeted lifeline infrastructures. A large number of cyberattacks in the
    water industry has been noticed over a short time, and this number is increasing
    [28]. These cyberattacks disturb water distribution and water treatment/purification
    systems. In 2020, a large number of cyber attacks was noticed in the water industry
    [42]. In the water industry in Israel, the first attack was noticed in the modification
    of the chemicals used to process tap water, followed by attacks on city water
    pumps and the agriculture sector. Although these attacks were minor and there
    was no big loss or damage, Israel’s responsible authorities started to focus on
    strict cyber security measurements in water treatment plants. Israel’s national
    cyber chief stated “We can see something like this aiming to cause damage to real
    life and not to IT or data” [42,64]. Out of several incidents in the water industry,
    one of them is the 2016 attack on a company commonly using the pseudonym “Kemuri
    Water Company (KWC)” in Israel [14]. After hiring expert security persons in KWC,
    the company came to learn that there were still many vulnerabilities in their
    plant architecture. After a careful examination of the KWC systems, the security
    firm discovered a series of mysterious valve manipulation patterns combined with
    the IP addresses of state-sponsored hacktivists in the facility’s traffic records
    and possible unauthorized access to the subsystems. Further investigation helped
    to collect useful shreds of evidence in the infrastructure of KWC, which uncovered
    ex-filtration of 2 million plus unique results and chemical flow rate manipulation
    [43]. The authors of [65] studied a similar water attack incident that happened
    in 2020. In reality, OT systems were updated according to the times; the OTs used
    were outdated, and several IT OTs were working with AS400, and a 1988 built-in
    IBM application system was in use [66]. The following functions were conducted
    by AS400: Controlling flow control applications and several PLC devices for the
    water valve and the operation of the SCADA platform. The SCADA system in water
    treatment and purification plant was shown in Figure 3c. Billing information of
    the water utility customers and hosting personally identifiable information. A
    router for the various KMC-connected networks was used for storing the firms’
    financial statements. In addition, SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in
    the system [43,67], and the AS400 system was also connected to the Internet. The
    internal IP address and login information for the web server hosting the payment
    application was kept in plaintext in a .ini file, giving opponents access. The
    following vulnerabilities were found by experts in the KWC system: Outdated devices
    in the systems were in operation; There was no time-to-time updating of the system;
    The company was using the IBM application system built in 1988 and designed for
    intermediate and small-sized firms on a large-scale firm; Remote connection vulnerabilities.
    Now we would like to summarize the effects of the attack on KWC. There were the
    following effects: modified the level of chemicals used to process tap water;
    breaching the personal identification information system; trying to access the
    customer’s payment information and managing water flow valves and chemical mixtures
    ratios Such kinds of attacks are known as “Device Type” attacks because they directly
    impact the control strategies, limits, and set point of actuators in touch with
    the industrial processes. After careful investigation, it was suggested that KWC
    install new technology devices within the system to meet the state-of-the-art
    security practice for the safety of human lives and the company’s financial interests.
    KWC Attack Type The attacker found easy access to the login application and breached
    the personal identification system to obtain access to the client payment information
    service [67]. Attackers entered using the IT environment, carrying the attack
    payload to the OT endpoints and damaging the accessible infrastructure and quality
    of water. This attack proves that industrial facilities, and especially complex
    infrastructure, must ensure that the security standards and strategies required
    to meet a secure IIoT system are attained. Figure 6 shows the attacker’s way into
    KWC. Figure 6. Attacker way to KWC incident. 6.2. Florida Water Supply Attack
    In [68], there is a new story of a cyber attack on a water treatment plant in
    a Florida city. A worker in plant management observed that the mouse cursor was
    moving strangely on the screen and was not in his control, so he informed the
    local police. In the beginning, there was no concern; his manager frequently connected
    to his computer to keep an eye on the facility’s systems. The plant utilized the
    remote-access program TeamViewer to let employees exchange displays and troubleshoot
    IT difficulties. Within a short time, the attacker was trying to vary the water
    supply level of sodium hydroxide, moving the setting from 100/ppm (parts per million)
    to 11,100 ppm. This disturbs the PH level at a low level and damages human tissue
    it touches at a high level. According to officials [68], the operator quickly
    overcame the problem and returned the water to its normal position. There is no
    idea as to how it happened (i.e., whether from inside or outside). The Federal
    Board of Investigation (FBI) and the city’s own investigation teams are currently
    searching for the reason behind this attack. 6.3. Bay Area Utility Attack for
    Drinking Water System Recently, in the US, a hacker obtained access to the Bay
    Area drinking water system digital network and tried to vary the effluent quality
    [69]. According to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, the attacker
    gained the TeamViewers login information of one of the company’s former employees
    in order to obtain access to the system. Refs. [70,71] reported that the hacker
    tried to poison the drinking water plant serving the San Francisco Bay Area. In
    initial reports, it was hard to identify the hacker’s means of access. The case
    will be handed to the Federal Board of Investigation (FBI), who will search for
    the cause. The Biden government [72] seems interested in overcoming cyber attacks
    on drinking water plants and other critical infrastructure in the country. It
    is a good step for the US state to make drinking water safe; however, there a
    significant challenges, such as the following: In the critical infrastructure
    of the entire country, water treatment plants are considered most vulnerable to
    hackers. It is difficult for everyone to follow cyber security rules, and it is
    easy to cause major harm to several people. According to NBC news [70] weather,
    recently, water plant attacks have increased because there is no specific federal
    industry for water treatment security accountability. 6.4. Colonial Pipeline Attack
    (CPA) Incident Sticking to critical US infrastructure, there is the question which
    type of attack was inflicted om the drinking water system. It has also been confirmed
    by officials of the FBI that the attacker forced the Colonial pipeline [42] to
    shut down the gasoline and jet fuel to the East Coast. The attacker tried to obtain
    access via ransomware, which is a type of malware that encrypts data until victims,
    who are threatened with their data being made publicly available via the internet,
    pay a ransom. Fox News confirmed [71] “In order to prevent the ransomware from
    spreading and because it was unable to bill customers since it’s business and
    accounting networks were down, Colonial Pipeline preemptively shut down its pipeline
    operations”. In Table 3, we present some of the well-known cyber attacks on the
    water industry from the last five years. Table 3. List of some famous water industry
    cyber attacks from 2018–2022. CPA Effects This attack caused the fuel price to
    rise at a high level. This attack also forced some airplanes to make extra fuel
    stops and compelled a White House strategy. 6.5. Riviera Beach Attack A police
    department employee unleashed a devastating ransomware attack on Riviera Beach,
    a tiny city with 35,000 residents north of West Palm Beach (Florida), on 29 May
    2019, openning a compromised email crippling the computer systems of the police
    force, the municipal council, and other neighborhood government offices, All operations
    were shut down by the malware, which also encrypted their data. The attack also
    affected the water utility, compromising the computer systems in charge of pumping
    stations, testing the water’s purity, and handling payments. The city council
    unanimously agreed to allow its insurer to pay the attackers 65 bitcoins, or about
    USD 600,000, a few days after the attack. The city’s budget would be used to cover
    an additional USD 25,000 in insurance deductibles. After the attack, two weeks’
    investigation revealed that the IT division which created the city’s website and
    email services was running at full capacity, although the water pump stations
    and systems for assessing water quality were only partially accessible. The municipal
    council representative emphasized that although water quality sampling had to
    be done manually, the water quality itself was never in jeopardy. The FBI, Secret
    Service, and DHS looked into the incident and advised the city not to pay the
    ransom. Instead of waiting for a description key from the attacker, local authorities
    decided to purchase new hardware and computers by spending USD 900,000 because
    most of the devices and computers were old and vulnerable to the attacker. This
    shows that small towns and cities are more vulnerable to attackers because of
    their old systems. 6.6. Secure Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) Lab Validation and
    Challenges At the Singapore University of Technology and Design, there is a SWTP
    test bed plant [50]. This plant has been widely used by researchers [16] for secure
    mechanisms and control infrastructure. In this section, we studied the introduction
    and challenges faced by researchers in the lab plant. Introduction of SWTP SWTP
    is meeting the latest technology requirements for the water treatment process.
    Its production capacity is almost 19 liters/minute for water purification by the
    use of ultra-filtration. This SWTP ICS consists of six stages, with each stage
    each stage labeled as Pn where n is for the nth stage. At this stage, there are
    sensors and actuators. Sensors are for measuring the quantity level of water in
    the tank, the pressure, and the water flow, and also for measuring properties
    such as conductivity, PH, and oxidation reduction potential. Electric pumps are
    motor valves which operate as actuators. The functionality of SWTP stages are
    as follows: Stage 1—Raw water for treatment; Stage 2—Chemical dosing to treat
    water depending on the measurements from water quality sensors.; Ultrafiltration;
    Removal of free chlorine from water; Water passes to reverse osmosis process;
    Cleaning the ultrafiltration unit through the backwash process. 6.7. Challenges
    in Anomaly Detection Challenges faced during the process of anomaly detection
    and development are divided into the following categories: model creation; model
    deployment; and model training. 6.8. Challenges in Model Creation There are following
    challenges faced during model creation. Supervised vs. unsupervised learning Supervised
    machine learning (ML) is useful for attack detection [83,84]. Supervised ML models
    are unsuccessful in the detection of unknown attacks due to signature deficiency.
    The signature updating process is highly complex in ICS. Many researchers and
    industries prefer unsupervised learning for the process of attack detection [85,86]
    because unsupervised learning is designed on normal plant operation requirements.
    A comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning is presented in [85]. Unsupervised
    learning is more useful but can enhance the number of false alarms. Model localization:
    in a wide system, ICS is a complex distributed control system as there are several
    steps in the water treatment process that must be connected logically and physically.
    It is important to consider whether to create a single model for the whole throughout
    system or for different steps. Scalability: For this, ref. [87] is best work to
    consult. There is a sensor multitude consisting of pressure, level, quantity,
    and flow [88]. The work in question shows that unsupervised learning is better
    than supervised learning for attack detection in water treatment plants. Reliability
    and data availability. Model deployment is another challenging phase. Data sampling
    rate; System Modeling: In the system modeling process, modeling the entire physical
    state space during the training phase is also challenging. Model retraining: Once
    the detector has been validated, built, and tested in live plant operation, it
    may demonstrate a different performance than it did in the initial stages, and
    such observations also face challenges such as distribution shift, noisy data,
    attack localization, limiting the source attack, unbalanced data, alternation
    of parameters, process parameter changes, model validation, model complexity,
    and attack detection speed etc. 7. Vulnerabilities, Challenges, and Future Prospective
    in the IIoT Environment of Water Purification and Distribution Plants Vulnerabilities
    assessment in water purification and distribution plants assist in highlighting
    the malicious activity threat and trigger quick action which can minimize the
    risk of serious attack from attacker action [43]. This water distribution system
    vulnerability may impact the overall distribution or purification system [44].
    Assessment of vulnerability in a system provides a model by which to reduce the
    attack impact and reduce the cost. The above studies show that this modern purification
    plant is linked to open internet and IIoT-linked devices with a number of vulnerabilities,
    as listed below. 7.1. Physical Layer Vulnerabilities can be due to physical elements
    such as reservoirs, valves, pipes, motors, PLCs, distillation, tankers, etc. There
    can be faults or errors in any physical element which may lead to losses [47].
    7.2. Human Layer The human is the greatest point of vulnerability for an attacker.
    Usually, attackers use social engineering methods to enter the environment, and
    a social engineering attack is conducted via human factors such as employees,
    managers, and contractors, exploiting a person’s lack of education, greedy nature,
    or psychological issue [24]. 7.3. Cyber Layer SIn CADA and data acquisition etc.,
    some general vulnerabilities are as follows: Improper device management (such
    as installation of devices without any prior knowledge or planning); Insecure
    devices (such as old designed devices which are OT-designed but have no capacity
    to meet IT requirements); Insecure ecosystem; Use of old devices/components in
    a network environment (such as old PLCs, SCADA systems, and OT devices); Insecure
    Network connection (such as communication between sensors and PLCs, actuators
    and PLCs, or PLCs and SCADA communication). 7.4. Challenges and Future Prospective
    IIoT is linked with IT and OT. In the above real-world experiments, we studied
    attacks that happened in the water industry. We also studied the challenges in
    the real-world water industry. IIoT is not limited to the water industry; it covers
    all kinds of industries such as energy, chemical, oil and gas, health, agriculture,
    etc. The authors of [89] explained the means by which to overcome the challenges
    in water treatment plant security. Here, we would like to discuss some challenges
    in IIoT or Industry 4.0 [27]. Interoperability Even if the individual devices
    in an interconnected system operate in completely diverse fields, they must all
    be able to communicate with one another and speak the same language. In the world
    of the IoT, things are made more difficult by a lack of standard software interfaces,
    data formats, and networking protocols. Due to the incompatibility of various
    technologies, 40% of the Industrial IoT’s potential economic value will remain
    locked in the industry. The long lifespan of conventional equipment, which necessitates
    pricey retrofitting or replacement to work with the most recent technologies,
    further complicates the goal of seamless interoperability. Security The vulnerability
    to cyberattacks is greater than ever as more and more industrial users demand
    to be able to remotely access all of their Internet-connected devices and cloud-based
    services. Cybersecurity has hitherto concentrated on a small set of endpoints.
    With the introduction of the Industrial Internet, security must broaden its scope
    to cover both the real and virtual worlds. Reliability IP-based networks that
    are dependable are essential to the IoT’s development. Tried-and-true devices
    are also essential to a successful network. In the demanding operating environments
    typical of the oil, gas, maritime, power, and railway industries, device dependability
    in the IoT is extremely crucial. It is in these sectors’ best interests to install
    robust enough devices because they will depend more and more on remote access.
    If the system’s backend is unreliable, even the best-designed and most user-friendly
    front end will be useless. The adoption of the IoT will be negatively impacted
    by devices that are flawed or malfunctioning as a result of adverse climatic conditions
    such as excessive heat or cold. We are all acutely aware of the potential effects
    of device failure, including risks to individuals, expensive downtime, and incorrect
    data interpretation, to mention a few. A strong, high-performing backend infrastructure
    is crucial for the Industrial IoT to succeed. Scalability The unpleasant reality
    is that with billions of additional connected devices on the horizon and billions
    more now linked, millions of possible event failures are bound to occur. Infrastructures
    for industrial systems that are scalable and capable of extension are required.
    By 2020, more than 200 billion “Connected Things” will exist worldwide, according
    to IDC. Future deployments will also see an increase in mobile, sporadic connectivity,
    and low-power devices that must interact with a dynamic environment. IoT systems
    must be scalable and adaptable, using software or additional functionality that
    seamlessly fits into a larger solution. Network Performance Simply put, most networks
    are not built to handle the problems of an increasing IoT. In order to incorporate
    video, speech, data, and control commands, integrated networks with high bandwidth
    are necessary given the trend toward multi-system integration and video surveillance.
    The limitations of legacy monitoring methods have already been reached. The requirement
    to collect and analyze an increasingly growing quantity of data points produced
    by billions of devices will put enormous pressure on networks to expand their
    bandwidth. In order to move this much data over the Internet, unprecedented amounts
    of bandwidth are required; otherwise, networks may experience bottlenecks. Management
    Construction of the Industrial IoT must take upgrades and maintenance into consideration.
    System administrators will be required to oversee all of the new systems as well
    as the original system as a complex web of interconnected devices grows. By giving
    network engineers the following tools, modern management solutions simplify their
    jobs. Application program Iiterfaces (APIs) are an effective tool for streamlining
    the creation of applications for managing devices or systems; A complete network
    administration solution that includes setup, running, upkeep, and diagnostics;
    Instead of relying solely on conventional maintenance schedules, predictive maintenance
    uses sensors to continuously monitor equipment to avert malfunctions and predict
    when maintenance will be necessary; Engineers can access real-time device status
    information and event notifications via mobile management apps; A productivity
    tool for quickly configuring and deploying devices Future Prospective of IIoT:
    The IIoT has a bright future ahead of it, with more options for internet-to-device
    connection and cost-effective predictive maintenance available to small enterprises
    and multinational organizations. The possibility of connecting more facilities
    will also increase as IIoT access becomes more affordable. Many experts also believe
    that WiFi-powered devices will eventually take the place of IoT devices that are
    currently powered by hardwired connections. Overall, more firms will profit from
    the IIoT as it becomes more widely available. In the futurem the IIoT will be
    useful in device management, advancement in sensor technology, predictive IoT
    gaining adoption, ensuring security, location tracking, keeping an eye on real-time
    data, IIoT as service, better operational efficiency, wuality control, and customer
    service. Predictive maintenance, digital twins, cloud edge computing and more
    connected devices. Furthermore, with the countless advantages of IIoT, experts
    are also concerned with the increase in cyberattacks. A study [90,91] shows that
    cybercrime’s global cost will increase from USD 8.44 trillion in 2022 to USD 23.84
    trillion by 2027. According to [42,92], the Biden administration has vowed to
    overcome the security issues in the water and oil and gas industries. The U.S.
    government decided to take fast and quick action against such attacks, which an
    increase of 50% across the world in 2020 [92]. From the above study, we concluded
    that water purification and distribution are critical infrastructures; without
    water, there is no life, and there are serious impacts from cyberattacks on newly
    deployed water purification and distribution plants. We studied several real-life
    incidents and attack detection methods. From the study, it has been observed that
    there are limited attacks, but in the future, this number can increase. Moreover,
    current attack detection methods are insufficient and are unable to detect all
    kinds of attacks. Hence, there are several key challenges and research directions
    that can be addressed by researchers. It has been noticed from the above studies
    that attack impact can be minimized in purification and distribution plants; however,
    current research is insufficient to reduce the attack impact. Because of key components
    such as SCADA, PLCs, and sensors irregularities, faults occur, and these irregularities
    can cause tank overflow, pipe burst, valve locking, or motor outage. Available
    water distribution and purification systems deploy certain software and hardware
    tools to overcome the faults in the system but are limited and expensive. The
    water distribution and purification plant is a real-time environment and it should
    not halt its operation, even in a faulty situation. For this, there must be a
    fault tolerance algorithm or tool that can enhance resilience, separate the damaged
    or faulty components, and recover from attack effects. For such fault tolerance,
    deep learning techniques can be useful in attack or fault location identification.
    Deep learning techniques can also be useful in providing mitigation. It is important
    to design and develop safe and secure methods. Several studied techniques use
    deep learning-, machine learning-, or artificial intelligence-based algorithms
    [93]. However, there are some disadvantages to such approaches, such as ensemble
    datasets and high dimensional data. Furthermore, the ensemble dataset may cause
    inaccuracy in the dataset with respect to attack identification when using machine
    learning techniques. By reducing false negative rates, enhancing data training
    is also a key issue. The use of hybrid methods is more useful than others. In
    addition, at time of writing, there has been no work on explaining and detecting
    the various kinds of attacks in water purification and distribution systems, so
    it needs more research and attention. IoT devices with various smart devices developed
    in a purification plant permit transparency in water transportation systems such
    as monitoring and processing systems. Because of limited resources, the network
    becomes vulnerable. In this case, privacy and security are both key challenges
    because of the IoT device’s properties such as less battery timing, low capacity,
    low memory, and regulations. Violation of privacy reduces the water acceptance
    level. The key objective of privacy violation is to access private data such as
    customer data, monitoring data, system functioning data, etc. To date, there has
    been a lack or deficiency of universal IoT security devices with which to secure
    the water treatment and distribution plant. To meet the new advanced technology
    devices, there should be a universal algorithm designed to secure the water supply.
    For reliability, safety, and security, we require enhancements to the network
    communication security wit respect to the varying data in various components of
    the ICS environment. For data exchange, there are heterogeneous networks like
    wide area networks (WAN), home area Nntworks (HAN), WiFi, etc. This variation
    in the communication network can become the cause of major cyber attacks in the
    ICS environment. There are various issues such as verification of heterogeneous
    networks, key management, access control, and privacy protection. In addition,
    in smart water purification and distribution plants, there is an exchange of data
    over the network, and they store data in the network or in the central system
    such as SCADA, due to which the attacker’s key objective remains targeting the
    SCADA system to obtain control of the ICS environment. There is a requirement
    for suitable tools to be installed in a suitable place. Most of the studies show
    similar attacks and, overall, the work is very limited. For consensus and robustness
    in water plant security systems, there is a requirement for new, advanced, and
    updated systems or algorithms that can overcome these issues. Anti-detection attacks,
    collaborative attacks, and multiple-factor attacks are future research directions
    in water purification and distribution plants. 8. Cyber Safety Tips in IIoT Everyone
    understands the importance of water and the water industry in his/her life and
    of protecting it from digital threats. Many organizations have provided guidelines
    with which to protect their plants from cyber attacks. The following are some
    basic guidelines for cyber security protection in IIoT and the water industry
    [94]: Avoid revealing personal or sensitive data to phishers; Never click or open
    any malicious link; Prefer to use a VPN when using public WiFi; Avoid plugging
    an unknown USB into your computer; Before downloading software, verify its legitimacy;
    Keep software updated; Employ up-to-date patches; Select prevention over detection
    technology. In conclusion, we can say that water purification and distribution
    plants can be improved via reliability, security, mitigation, detection, and recovery
    techniques. There should be due consideration of cryptography algorithms such
    as network communication security, IoT devices security, and cyber–physical design
    security. At the time of writing this review, there has been very limited work
    on the security of water purification and distribution plants. In the future,
    quality research should be conducted in this domain. 9. Discussion There are “Evil
    Eyes” in the water purification and distribution industry that are creating serious
    issues for the community, society, and even humanity. It has been noted that these
    evil eyes are becoming greedy and targeting the industry more and more. The progress
    of technology is leaving several vulnerabilities in the system and providing gateways
    to evil eyes through which to observe and enter the system. It has been noted
    that in traditional or old water distribution systems, evil eyes could only damage
    the OT infrastructure, while the integration of IT and OT provided an opportunity
    for these evil eyes to disturb the overall system, vary the chemicals, and can
    obtain control of the SCADA system. In this paper we provided some real incidents
    that occurred because of these evil eyes. We studied system weak point “vulnerabilities”
    and affected countries and case studies in detail. We also discussed the impact
    of evil eyes on the environment/system. We explained that evil eyes used advanced
    technologies such as IT and OT architecture, which are vulnerable to the internet.
    They are easy targets for evil eyes because of the number of potential objectives
    to which they are vulnerable, such as getting control of the network, intalling
    ransomware, varying the chemicals in the water, etc. We feel it necessary to share
    real case incidents the researchers and industrialists for secure network planning.
    Most of the cyberattack incidents happened in the USA, while Ukraine, Israel,
    and the UK are also affected countries. At the time of writing this review, there
    was little awareness in society regarding evil eye issues and their effects on
    the water purification and distribution industry. Most attackers are grouped based
    on their specific target and objective. Different attacker groups are divided
    into cyber-terrorists, who cause physical damage to the system; script kiddies,
    who engage in social engineering attacks such as motivating unskilled labour for
    entry purposes; hacktivists, who have political or social objectives; and cyber-criminals,
    who have financial objectives, etc. Researchers also studied [95] a few other
    groups, such as internal actors, cyber actors, and black hats. The classification
    depends on the attacker’s objectives and whether the attacker originates from
    inside or outside the system. We also summarized the attacker’s means of entering
    the ICS environment. We provided examples of vulnerabilities in the system, attackers’
    target points, and attacker entranceways. We noted that at the time of writing,
    there was no universal algorithm/technique/mechanism that could secure the water
    industry from these evil eyes. There is a need for a universal algorithm that
    could detect, deny, and deceive these evil eyes to protect the plant process.
    In this paper, we provided the future prospects of cyber security in IIoT and
    water purification and distribution plants. We also provided some security tips
    with which to keep the industrial environment secure from these evil eyes. This
    survey paper worked on residential, agricultural, and industrial water applications.
    Studying recent attack incidents and researchers’ efforts, it appears that the
    development of water monitoring systems to assess the effects of cyber attacks
    on water quality remains the only focus of research in water and wastewater distribution
    and purification applications. First and foremost, developing precise, improved
    detection technologies is crucial. Nowadays, the majority of techniques use artificial
    neural networks or machine learning techniques. Second, the reliability of data
    exchange across various WDS components can be increased by strengthening network
    and communication security. Third, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other intelligent
    devices provide the water distribution system (WDS) with more utility by ensuring
    real-time monitoring and automatic processing while allowing transparency in the
    water supply chain processes. Finally, there is great attention paid to the attack
    effect in the WDS. In conclusion, measures for mitigation, recovery, and prevention
    can all improve the WDS. We must take into account both secure software and hardware.
    Cryptographic algorithms, security network/communication protocols, cyber–physical
    system designs, and device-level security (such as IoT security), etc., should
    all be taken into account. According to the literature, there is still a dearth
    of studies on security for the WDS. Future studies could be conducted on a wide
    range of subjects. 10. Conclusions The global organized society is currently being
    impacted, and will continue to be impacted, by the issue of cyber-security. Additionally,
    as infrastructure becomes more interconnected and communicative, a significant
    issue with cyber–physical security will arise in key infrastructure, such as the
    water supply. This paper provided a comprehensive study of the evil eyes in water
    purification and distribution systems. We discussed real-world cases in the water
    industry, vulnerabilities, gateways, and evil eye targets. This paper highlighted
    current real-world cases that occurred in the water and wastewater purification
    and distribution industry. In this paper, we highlighted how attackers obtain
    entrance into an ICS system. We covered a number of vulnerabilities and challenges
    in the system. This paper is useful for securing the ICS environment of water
    purification and distribution systems and other industries targetted by the evil
    eye. There are a large number of incidents in the water industry, but we covered
    only a few of the major incidents for better understanding of readers. We highlighted
    open challenges in the ICS environment of the water industry and other industries
    under the threat of evil eyes. We also presented the future prospects of IIoT
    in an ICS environment and some useful tips. Our paper is intended to promote sufficient
    knowledge and awareness in the community. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Agriculture plays a vital role in the growth of humankind. The total
    world depends upon the agricultural contribution, and wherein the agriculture
    purely depends upon the necessity of irrigation. This paper develops an autonomous
    irrigation system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the 6G enabled Internet
    of Things (6G-IoT) transforming to create a hassle-free smart agriculture model.
    The developed autonomous irrigation system is purely based on prediction algorithm
    which is mount in a microprocessor, which uses weather history data using IoT
    to identify and predict rainfall patterns and any climatic changes; hence it creates
    an intelligent system which irrigates the field depending upon the outer environment.
    The developed system not only checks the environmental condition, but it also
    measures the moisture content of the soil to supply the required amount of water
    to the crops. The developed autonomous AI and 6G-IoT based smart agricultural
    irrigation system has been tested under control environment with an accuracy of
    86.34%, sensitivity of 89.28% and precision of 91%. Hence, the proposed methodology
    could be the possible solution for autonomous irrigation of crops in future.

    Agriculture is probably the greatest worry to all humanity since the vast majority
    of food is created by farming. As of now, numerous individuals still experience
    the ill effects of yearning because of the absence of food in certain nations,
    particularly in Africa. Exceptionally, hunger caused the persistent undernourishment
    of in excess of 800 million individuals on the planet in 2016. All the more remarkably,
    in excess of 10 million people has been left to die from hunger every year [1].
    Clearly, expanding food creation is without a doubt a viable method for destroying
    yearning and destitution. But it''s not that easy, the agriculture is a long way
    from modernization in a large portion of agricultural nations, prompting low food
    creation [2]. In recent days, Smart Agriculture (SA) is an arising idea that alludes
    to overseeing ranches utilizing present day Information and Communication Technologies
    to expand the amount and nature of items while advancing the human work required
    [3]. Especially, the SA frameworks bring together several advanced computer and
    information technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things
    (IoT), and Cloud Computing (CC) into the smart agricultural creation [4]. Among
    these techniques, IoT and AI are the predominantly significant technique that
    creates the SA framework. Without the role of IoT and AI, it''s significantly
    not possible to create a SA system [5,6]. In the SA system, the IoT is mainly
    used to automatically collect agricultural data and to transmit the collected
    data to the data centres. Whereas, artificial intelligence techniques analyze
    the agricultural data using the machine learning, neural network and clustering
    technique for smart decision-making in the SA system [7,8]. For example, when
    there is lack of water in the environment created with smart agriculture framework,
    the action will be taken immediately to watering the crops in that environment
    by analysing the data collected by the IoT and AI analysing the data. Several
    researchers have been working to develop smart agriculture model using AI and
    IoT. In [9], smart agriculture based on IoT system and deep reinforcement learning
    with four-layer has been developed. The developed system also integrated AI and
    CC to increase smart agriculture food production. In [10], the author has developed
    Agri trust, (i.e.,) a trust management approach for smart agriculture using CC
    and IoT. The developed Agri trust identifies malicious and compromised data interval
    and provides a friendly agricultural environment to the people migrated from other
    cities. In [11], the author has developed an Agro-IoT collaboration framework
    for creating a smart agriculture environment. The developed Agro-IoT framework
    is specially designed for sugarcane agriculture. The developed framework facilitates
    a live communication medium between farmers and government. It also works as a
    monitoring medium to observe the growth of the crops, moisture content and to
    control the cultivation wastages. In [12], IoT and AI-based architecture system
    for smart cities and agriculture have been developed. The developed architecture
    converges the earlier system to develop a smart system using layered, service-oriented
    and cloud-based software architecture using IoT and the architecture enhances
    the yielding. In [13], the author has developed smart farming using the IoT to
    rectify the current food production. The author has also reviewed several methodologies
    addressing smart agricultural problems. The author has proved that the IoT and
    AI could be the methods that could solve the crop framing problems and improve
    the accuracy of crop diagnosis. In [14], the author investigates 6 G wireless
    systems with IoT for the expected support in truly global wireless communications,
    anywhere and anytime. The developed system with 6G-IoT is an ISTN, that is expected
    to be at the core of 6 G communication systems, and how to build a high-capacity
    yet low-cost ISTN is of significant importance in developing global 6 G communication
    systems. In [15], the author presents a point-by-point overview of remote advancement
    towards the 6G-IoT network. In this review, the great spotlight is on the new
    compositional changes related with 6 G networks, portrayed by universal 3D inclusion,
    the presentation of unavoidable AI and upgraded network convention stack. Spotted
    hyena optimizer, Emperor penguin optimizer with bio-inspired, Seagull optimization
    algorithm, STOA based bio-inspired based optimization algorithm has been developed
    to solve industrial engineering problems [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Later,
    artificial intelligence, neural network, and machine learning based solutions
    are been provided for complex industrial engineering problems [21], [22], [23],
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. These soft computing techniques can be further utilized
    for autonomous irrigation system. For the review, it has been identified that
    the autonomous irrigation system requires technology to support such as AI, 6-G
    network and IoT [21]. Combining all these together could build up a new paradigm
    that will sort out current problems in smart agriculture. In this paper, an autonomous
    irrigation system for smart agriculture using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
    been developed. The developed smart agriculture irrigation system helps in transforming
    the traditional irrigation system to create a hassle-free smart agriculture irrigation
    model using AI and 6 G enabled IoT. The developed autonomous irrigation system
    is purely based on prediction algorithm which is mount in a microprocessor, which
    uses weather history data using IoT to identify and predict rainfall patterns
    and any climatic changes; hence it creates an intelligent system which irrigates
    the field depending upon the outer environment. The developed system not only
    checks the environmental condition, but it also measures the moisture content
    of the soil to supply the required amount of water to the crops. The developed
    autonomous AI and 6 G -IoT based smart agricultural irrigation system has been
    tested under control environment with an accuracy of 86.34% which could probably
    the solution for irrigating crops in future. 2. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture
    is focusses on the use of data acquired through various sources such as, geographical
    data, historical data and mechanical system data to manage the agricultural activities.
    Smart frameworks separate themselves through their capacity to record the information
    and bode well out of it. Keen cultivating utilizes equipment like IoT, AI and
    programming Software as a service (SaaS) to catch the information and give significant
    bits of knowledge to deal with all the procedure on the homestead, both pre- and
    post-reap. The smart agriculture frame work is shown in Fig. 1. The information
    is coordinated, open constantly and brimming with information on each part of
    money and field tasks that can be observed from any place on the planet. IoT in
    horticulture includes sensors, robots and robots associated through the web which
    work consequently and semi naturally performing activities and social occasion
    information pointed toward expanding productivity and consistency. With expanding
    requests and lack of work across the globe, horticulture computerization and robots
    or regularly known as Agri-bots are beginning to acquire consideration among ranchers.
    Yield creation diminished by an expected 213 crores approx ($3.1 billion) a year
    because of work deficiencies in the different countries. Ongoing headways in sensors
    and AI innovation that lets machines to prepare on their environmental factors
    have made ag-robots more prominent [28]. The world is in the beginning phases
    of an ag advanced mechanic''s unrest with a large portion of the items still in
    preliminary stages and R&D mode. Download : Download high-res image (517KB) Download

    farming system, self-loader robots with arms can identify weeds and splash pesticides
    in the influenced plants, setting aside the plants just as by and large pesticide
    costs. These robots can likewise be utilized in reaping and lifting. Hefty cultivating
    vehicles can likewise be explored from the solace of homes through telephone screens
    to perform errands and GPS can follow their situations at without fail. Robots
    furnished with sensors and cameras are utilized for imaging, planning and reviewing
    the ranches. They can be distantly controlled or they can fly consequently through
    programming-controlled flight plans in their inserted frameworks, working as a
    team with sensors and GPS. From the robot information, bits of knowledge can be
    drawn with respect to trim wellbeing, water system, splashing, planting, soil
    and field, plant checking and yield forecast and significantly more. The IoT based
    far off detecting uses sensors put along with the ranches like climate stations
    for social event information which is communicated to insightful instrument for
    examination. The information gathered from light, moistness, temperature, shape
    and size have a possibility to change the yield. Furthermore, the information
    gathered by sensors regarding mugginess, temperature, dampness precipitation and
    dew discovery helps in deciding the climate design in ranches so development is
    accomplished for appropriate yields. The investigation of nature of soil helps
    in deciding the supplement worth and drier territories of ranches, soil seepage
    limit or acridity, which permits to change the measure of water required for the
    water system and the select most useful sort of development. PC imaging includes
    the utilization of sensor cameras introduced at various corners of the ranch or
    robots outfitted with cameras to create pictures which go through advanced picture
    handling. The pictures are utilized for quality control, illness identification,
    arranging and reviewing yield and water system observing through Image handling
    joined with AI which uses pictures from information base to contrast with pictures
    of harvests with deciding the size, shape, shading and development accordingly
    controlling the quality. 3. Developed AI and 6G-IoT based autonomous irrigation
    system IoT based smart irrigation system framework is fit for mechanizing the
    water system measure by breaking down the moisture level of soil and the atmosphere
    condition. At the point when the power supply is given to the microcontroller,
    it will check the dirt moisture level content of the soil [29]. On the off chance
    that the moisture content isn''t up to the limit then it makes the motor to pump
    water on consequently and turns off naturally on the off chance that it scopes
    to the limit level. The list of sensors applicable in the smart agriculture is
    listed in Table 1. The need for water for any crops is likewise decreased radically.
    Far off checking is too conceivable in IoT based savvy water system framework.

    Sensor devices Applications 1 Volumetric Sensor Volumetric soil moisture sensors
    straightforwardly measure the measure of water in the dirt. This classification
    has the most sensor types: neutron dampness tests, heat dispersal sensors, and
    the normal, di-electric sensors. 2 Di-electric sensors The di-electric sensors
    measure the di-electric steady of the dirt, an electrical property reliant on
    soil dampness content, and can be bought in 3 varieties: Time Domain Refractometry
    (TDR) sensors, Time Domain Transmissometer (TDT) sensors, and capacitance or Frequency
    Domain Refractometry (FDR) sensors. 3 Tensiometers Tensiometers are soil dampness
    sensors that measure this strain between soil particles and water atoms. A tensiometer
    is a vertical, water-filled cylinder with a permeable tip that is embedded into
    the dirt at suggested profundities; the dirt coaxes water out of the permeable
    tip of the fixed cylinder, making a vacuum. Drier soils make a more grounded vacuum
    since water atoms are more diligently to pull off soil particles. 4 Solid state
    sensors Solid state sensors are an expensive device, that is used to measure the
    soil data. Solid state sensors work by utilizing two cathodes to quantify the
    electrical obstruction in the dirt. More water in the dirt will decrease electrical
    opposition in light of the fact that the electrical momentum can go through the
    water simpler; less water will build the obstruction. After the electrical obstruction
    is estimated the water strain is determined to decide the plant accessible soil
    dampness. 5 Granular matrix sensors Granular matrix sensors have a granular matrix
    inside a metal case. The electrical sensors are embedded in the granular matrix
    above a gypsum wafer. 3.1. IoT and AI framework In the developed autonomous irrigation
    framework, there are four layers which interact with each other. The layers such
    as Physical, Edge, Cloud, and Network are bond with each other by means of 6G-IoT
    and AI through a web service. Fig. 2 shows the architecture of the developed AI
    and IoT based autonomous irrigation system. The web service is written in PHP
    with a light weighted REST API to convey the information between the field gadget
    and the worker. The assistance is facilitated on Apache (Web worker) at the worker
    machine. The microcontroller gadget sends the field information to the worker
    utilizing this web administration. This web administration can deal with the organization
    variance/blackout during synchronizing the information from the documented gadget
    to the worker with the assistance of banner settings at the data set level. A
    web administration has been created in Arduino to gather the climate determining
    information. This web administration additionally totals the climate estimating
    information like temperature, mugginess, shadiness, UV Index and precipitation
    of various web determining entryways like Open Weather and Accuracy Weather utilizing
    API of these gateways. The created web administration read the anticipated information
    of the predetermined area utilizing API and store it in MySQL data set at the
    worker, which is considered in the forecast calculation. In the contest, the IoT
    Edge is an administration that expands on top of the IoT Hub and empowers clients
    to complete edge registering. Edge processing is when information is dissected
    on gadgets, that is, at the edge of the organization, as opposed to in the actual
    cloud. With edge processing, you can abstain from moving crude information via
    doing information cleaning, total, and examination on the actual gadget, and afterwards
    send the bits of knowledge acquired to the cloud. This will bring about diminished
    transmission capacity costs, faster reaction times and decreased traffic. This
    runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed there. It performs
    a number of functions including monitoring and managing the device and facilitating
    communications between the modules, the device, other devices, and the cloud.
    The runtime supports both Linux and Windows operating systems. Download : Download

    used to predict the soil moisture based on field information and climate determining
    information utilizing support AI calculation. The algorithm shows data with respect
    to soil moisture of the forthcoming days. It likewise gives water system recommendations,
    in view of the characterized level of soil moisture content and anticipated precipitation,
    to save water and energy. The created data by calculation and gadget is put away
    in MySQL Database at the worker. Besides, the created system controls the hand-off
    change to begin/stop the water engine. In this module, a water siphon is associated
    with a hand-off switch that is constrained by a Wi-Fi empowered hub. The hub is
    constrained by the web administration through a trigger from the responsive electronic
    interface for continuous observing. Utilizing this electronic interface, the water
    siphon can be overseen distantly in manual and auto modes. The correspondence
    advances utilized in the proposed design is the Wi-Fi module/6G-Mobile information
    correspondence. In this trial examination, a Wi-Fi module has been utilized to
    send information to the worker. The algorithm used in the micro controller is
    given below. Algorithm of irrigation scheduling Initialize soil moisture content

    6G networks AI techniques provide the best opportunity to train auto-learning
    models to realize network optimization for 6 G wireless networks, allowing providers
    or operators to optimize the network parameters, resources or architectures to
    better adapt services for devices, finally make 6 G networks become intelligent,
    and agile. The improvement of 6 G network has an enormous scope, multi-layered,
    high perplexing, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Moreover, 6 G network need to help
    consistent availability and assurance different QoS necessities of the tremendous
    number of gadgets, just as cycle enormous measure of information produced from
    actual conditions. Computer-based intelligence procedures with ground breaking
    examination capacity, learning capacity, upgrading capacity and astute acknowledgement
    capacity, which can be utilized into 6 G network to brilliantly do execution advancement,
    information revelation, modern learning, structure association and confounded
    dynamic [30,31]. With the assistance of AI, we present an AI-empowered smart design
    for 6 G network which is fundamentally isolated into four layers as illustrated
    in Fig. 2. 3.2. Experimental setup The main objective of this experiment is to
    collect the physical parameters of a farming land using sensors and to utilize
    these sensors’ data along with weather forecast information for developing an
    algorithm for prediction of soil moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm
    uses a hybrid machine learning approach, as discussed in Section 3.1, to achieve
    higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction. The experimental setup is shown in
    Fig. 3. The Fig. 3(a) illustrates the architecture of the control connection kit,
    which consists of 6G-commnuication module with IoT enabled for fetching weather
    data and climate change data. The microcontroller board is connected to the tensiometer
    sensor. The tensiometer sensor is a filed data collection device that has been
    deployed in the garden of the test environment which was created to assess the
    performance of the autonomous irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network.
    The data collected in the test environment is stores in the server using the web
    service. Later, the collected data are been analysed using the AI approach and
    6G-IoT is responsive for the real time monitoring and data visualization. Fig.

    Fig. 3(b) shows the 6G-IoT of water system arranging module to plan the water
    system by setting Irrigation Date and Threshold Levels for Soil Moisture. This
    data, anticipated soil dampness and precipitation data will help client/rancher
    in arranging/planning of ideal water system. The created module works in two modes,
    viz., auto, and manual. In manual mode, the client takes the planning choice dependent
    on anticipated soil dampness and precipitation data. In auto mode, the client
    sets the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the framework naturally plans the
    water system date dependent on the anticipated soil dampness and climate conjecture
    (precipitation) data. For instance, if the downpour is normal on the planned water
    system date or close to the planned date, at that point, the framework will hang
    tight for the downpour and it will suspend the counterfeit/manual water system
    or it will begin watering (if necessary, in light of the calculation) the field
    to keep up least soil dampness work the appearance of the downpour. Further, the
    framework can deal with the progressions in gage precipitation esteems. The developed
    prototype can be extended to irrigate large area. 4. Result and discussion A profound
    assessment has been carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed autonomous
    irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network. In this assessment the developed
    module as discussed in Section 3.2 is assessed in the test environment created
    with devices like halogen lamp, measured oxygen content, air conditioner and water
    filter. The devices could absorb the moisture content of the soil and will help
    for fast testing. The testing was conducted on 24/12/2020 and 25/12/2020. The
    temperature of the test environment was measured in the interval of an hour. The
    halogen lamp in the test environment has been used like the daylight, the intensity
    of luminous has been increased during day bright hours. The data observed for
    the room temperature is depicted in the Fig. 4. From the figure it can be observed
    that the test environment temperature varies from 19°C to 33 °C. Further, in the
    meantime, humidity level has been assessed in the test environment and obtained
    humidity measurement is depicted in Fig. 5. From the figure it can be observed
    that humidity is 55% during morning and evening, and is 24% to 26% during day
    time. Moreover, the moisture level of the soil has been measured using, Volumetric
    Sensor, Tensiometer sensor, and Solid-state sensor and fed with the 6G-IoT module
    and AI system for further processing. The moisture level varies between 10% to
    45% and the observation data obtained for the test environment is depicted in
    the Fig. 6. From the figure it has be observed that the soil moisture reduces
    with high light luminous and increases with low luminous. Download : Download

    the figure it can be observed that the motor pump operates for 0 to 75% based
    on the variation of soil moisture (soil moisture is varied using halogen lamp
    operation in the test environment). The AI process in motor operation can be clearly
    identified in the Fig. 7, when the moisture level lowers 20% the motor pump is
    engaged to water. Using the developed autonomous irrigation system using AI-IoT
    based 6G network the farmers could monitor the water flow level and can also prevent
    over watering. Further, in the investigation the performance evaluation of different
    sensor used in the study has been evaluated. Fig. 8 shows the performance evaluation

  description: The Construction Real Estate Infrastructure and Project Management
    (CRIP) sector is a prominent sector among the industries worldwide. It plays a
    significant role in contributing to any country’s economy worldwide. Mainly several
    sub-sectors of the CRIP sector that contributes to country’s economy such as highways,
    railways, airways, waterways, irrigation, power generation, government buildings,
    residential buildings, etc. Many public sector projects add push toward the development
    of CRIP sector in India. The activities also involve multi-tasking and multi-activity
    with different types of people at different levels. Mostly, exchange of inter-departmental
    information utilizes vast amounts of data throughout the construction project
    activities. The efficiency of transformation of data depends on the way in which
    data were handled, transferred between different stages, and participants involved.
    This efficiency can be improved by implementing modern tools like automation—Internet
    of Things (IOT) framework, mobile application, computer software, etc. Among the
    different automation tool, the most familiar and most common tool is mobile applications.
    Even though several mobile applications are in practice, all the applications
    are not performing with full outcome. Although, many applications are lagging
    with data security, user friendliness, training intensity, etc. The main aim of
    this research study is to understand the benefits of automation, to compare various
    modern tools available in the market, and examine those modern tools to check
    if they rectify negative impacts of automation. The merits and demerits are discussed
    with the outcome of questionnaires from various users. This was achieved by performing
    a qualitative analysis among selected mobile applications.

    applications. Introduction The role of CRIP sector in infrastructure development
    of any country is unavoidable and highly significant, especially in developing
    countries like India. It plays a vital role in nation building and also it is
    one of the sectors contributing to country’s economy. Based on the recent survey
    conducted—Impact with Market Outlook 2017–2030, it is said that the construction
    industry contributes 8% to India’s GDP (Chen and Kamara 2005; Sattineni and Schmidt
    2015; Yakubu et al. 2015; Ekow and Kofi 2016; Djajalaksana et al. 2017). However,
    looking at the current pandemic scenario, the construction industry along with
    other industries has been affected drastically. It is high time to look into the
    issues in CRIP sector, finding out suitable strategy or mechanism to overcome
    the crisis. It can be ensured by effective project accomplishment needs—a coordinated
    work among the entire construction fraternity (Djajalaksana et al. 2017; Hemstrom
    et al. 2017; Ghobakhloo 2018; Frank et al. 2019). This can be achieved through
    better project planning, management, improved execution, new financial policies,
    adoption of new technologies, automation, etc. Automation is one such strategy
    that promises better planning, co-ordination and communication with the team,
    improved quality, better safety, more accuracy, forecasting of risks, data analysis,
    etc. (Chen and Kamara 2005; Sattineni and Schmidt 2015; Yakubu et al. 2015). There
    are various ways to implement the automation strategy in different sectors of
    construction activities such as autonomous machines on-site, drones to perform
    surveying, robotics in concrete works, Internet of Things (IOT) framework using
    sensors, mobile applications, computer software, mobile/cloud BIM technology,
    virtual reality technology, etc. (Abanda et al. 2018). Among the different automation
    tool, the most familiar and most common tool used in several developed countries
    is mobile applications (Ashok Kumar 2014; Ekow and Kofi 2016; Djajalaksana et
    al. 2017; Hussain and Hossain 2017). Mobile information systems and cloud computing
    proposal provide easy conclusion to complex problems. It makes the outcome distribution
    faster with real-time information services in project management (Sinda and Roja
    2017; Oke et al. 2017; Lee and Kim 2018). It increases the effectiveness of collaboration,
    and the reliability of the information helps in reducing information delays (Olanrewaju
    et al. 2017; Hussain et al. 2018). Several research studies pertaining to CRIP
    sector among the workers community in developing countries highlight that usage
    of modern tools like mobile app among workers is very poor, and more than 60%
    of workers were unaware of mobile applications and also had lack of knowledge
    in using the mobile application (Ekow and Kofi 2016). The communication among
    users improved with some various algorithm such as NOMA and LASSO used 4G to 5G
    and beyond in recent years with good outrage probability (Koteeshwari and Malarkodi
    2022a, b). In this digital era, it is mandatory that automation tool must be implemented
    in the CRIP sector and it is going to dominate entire sector in near future (Cline
    and Davis 2013). So, it is high time to find an effective strategy to overcome
    lapses with respect to the modern tools that need to be identified (Clancy et
    al. 2012). This research scrutinized the role of mobile technologies in refining
    the communication support for the building project site of CRIP sector (McMeel
    and Gonzalez 2019; Venkatraman and Yoong 2009; Sudharsan and Priyadharshni 2019;
    Rawal et al. 2019). Excellent cooperation and co-ordination between numerous construction
    specialists and the clientele are required for a building project to be completed
    successfully (Eze et al. 2020). Arantes and Ferreira (2021) provide a number of
    techniques to reduce delays in building, where communication is crucial. In some
    regions, poor connectivity with low transmission also causes discomfort (Sulaiman
    2022). In some aspects, mental health and psychological problem arises (Borjalilu
    et al. 2019; Bruehlman et al. 2020; Fu et al. 2021; Carla et al. 2021). The main
    purpose of this research study is to comprehend the benefits of digitalization
    for effective on-site communication, to compare various mobile applications available
    in the industry, to rectify the drawbacks of digitalization in the construction
    project activity (Olanrewaju et al. 2017; Hussain et al. 2018). Tools adopted
    to achieve the objective are by floating the questionnaire among the CRIP sector
    community. Based on the questionnaire outcome, both positive and negative aspects
    were inferred with respect to automation, and the qualitative analysis of data
    was carried out with the help of a qualitative data analyzing software called
    NVivo (Ekow and Kofi 2016; Djajalaksana et al. 2017; Sudharsan and Priyadharshni
    2019). The outcome of the research study was mainly based on a live case study
    of Pune-based construction firm. Methodology To achieve the objective and to procure
    suitable data to perceive the conclusion, a questionnaire was floated (Ekow and
    Kofi 2016; Oke et al. 2017; Abanda et al. 2018). The detailed methodology adopted
    to carry out the research to fulfill the end goal was stipulated in Fig. 1. Fig.
    1 Methodology adopted Full size image Results and discussion To ascertain the
    impact of automation among the construction community, a questionnaire was floated.
    This was done to get a clear understanding of what role does automation play and
    how its implementation affects construction projects. Respondents to the questionnaire
    belonged to the CRIP sector community such as construction professionals, construction
    managers, employees working at different designations and interns. Following statements
    were stated in the questionnaire to which the participants responded on a scale
    from strongly disagree to strongly agree given in Table1. Table 1 Impact of model
    technology Full size table Based on the questionnaire floated in Table 1, responses
    were received and the output of the questionnaire has been replicated in the following
    numbers, 58.6% agree that automation increases productivity and efficiency of
    work, 49.5% agree that it proves to be time saving, 51.1% agree that it provides
    effective on-site communication, and 49.5% agree that it proves to be useful in
    quality control and health, safety, and environment. From the above numbers, it
    can be understood that automation is advantageous which will help in development
    of construction industry (Clancy et al. 2012; Meland et al. 2011; Izkara et al.
    2017). The outcome of the questionnaire was then substantiated by means of a case
    study based on a Pune-based well-established real-estate company. Experiencing
    the current pandemic scenario, this real-estate company wanted to adopt digitalization
    on their 400-acre township project being executed. The company wanted to digitalize
    its construction processes of quality department to achieve better quality control
    (Sudharsan and Priyadharshni 2019; Rawal et al. 2019; Salvi and Kerkar 2020).
    Keeping this case study in mind, this research outcome talks about how mobile
    applications and software solutions as mentioned in Table 2 with respect to quality
    management, checklists, and inspections in achieving improved productivity, ensuring
    safety, etc., wereanalyzed. Table 2 List of software Full size table Mobile applications
    The software was scrutinized based on the methodology listed below in Table 2.
    Here, P, Q, R, and S are construction mobile applications and, in context of construction,
    A, B, C, and D are construction software solutions such as (Enterprice Resource
    Planning) ERP, (System Applications and Products in Data Processing) SAP, or customizable
    IT solutions. The mobile applications and construction software solutions are
    renamed as alphabetical letters to maintain its confidentiality. Out of the solutions
    identified, A and B (ERPs and SAPs, respectively) were removed from the quantitative
    and qualitative analysis to be carried out. The reason behind doing this was that
    maximum construction firms are using ERPs or SAPs for accounting, material procurement,
    or other such departments. Finding another ERP or SAP solution just for quality
    management will require the firm either to adopt two different ERP or SAP solution
    or move on to a completely new ERP or SAP solution to manage all their departments.
    Software developers such as C and D that provide customized IT solutions were
    also eliminated. This was done because getting a customized product after multiple
    discussions and meetings with the developers would be time consuming. Therefore,
    ready-to-use mobile applications like P, Q, R, and S are preferred and required
    so that users could be created, upload basic data, and commence using them to
    save time. Parameters to measure efficiency The parameters represented in Fig.
    1 and discussed in Tables 3 and 4 were used to measure efficiency of mobile applications.
    The user interface of the mobile application must be simple or user friendly and
    smooth. The application must not crash and lag. The application should be compatible
    both with mobile and PC. The application should be secured (i.e., no data theft).
    It must possess analytical dashboard (most preferably hyperlinked). It would be
    better if pre-installed checklists are provided. The report generated must be
    in pdf or excel. Intimating system is a must through the application (i.e., intimate
    by email via app and app notification). The application must not be expensive.
    Table 3 Information of apps P and Q Full size table Table 4 Information of apps
    R and S Full size table Tables 3 and 4 give out information associated to different
    parameters of all four mobile applications. This material was gathered after receiving
    demonstrations from their developers. Outcome of quantitative analysis To select
    the most effective mobile application and to meet with the objective, it was decided
    to prepare a ranking matrix, presented in Table 5. Different mobile applications
    were rated on common parameters to measure their efficiency. Ratings were provided
    on the basis of interface observed and information collected during the demonstration
    delivered. Total sum of all average score was calculated for every mobile application
    on the basis of which they were finally ranked. Table 5 Ranking matrix based on
    the parameter’s outcome Full size table Effective outcome of the qualitative analysis
    was interpreted using qualitative analyzing software called NVivo. The analysis
    was carried out by coding the parameters to measure efficiency based on the ranking.
    The outcome of the ranking was represented in the form of histograms as stipulated
    in Fig. 2a–d. Fig. 2 Parameters for mobile applications: a P, b Q, c R, and d
    S. Based on the interpretation of figure, the following information has been arrived
    from the quantitative analysis. For example, let us consider for mobile application
    P Full size image Interpretation of qualitative analysis outcome The interpretation
    of the histograms was done as follows. The x-axis represented parameters that
    highlight efficiency. Values ‘1’ and ‘0’ of a particular parameter in the y-axis
    signified ‘yes’ and ‘no’, respectively. For instance, the ‘iOS’ parameter stipulated
    in Fig. 2a–d showed ‘1’ on the y-axis which signified P, R, and S are available
    on iOS platform whereas Fig. 2a showed ‘0’which signified Q is not. Similarly,
    the ‘Features’ parameter that had values greater than ‘1’ on the y-axis stipulated
    in Fig. 2c, d, showed that applications P, Q, R, and S possessed 5, 5, 9, and
    6 major technological features, respectively. It can be accessed through a mobile
    phone as well as a web console. It has a client base of seven major construction
    companies. There are four different subscription packages offered by the developer
    having different costs and benefits. The client is charged on user basis and not
    on tower basis by the developer for the subscription package they select (i.e.,
    cost/user). The mobile application possesses an analytical dashboard. It is analytical
    only and not hyperlinked. It has five major technological features that make it
    attractive to use. The developer company is based in abroad and not in India.
    The users on the platform can be intimated through both email and mobile-push
    notification. The application is available on both android and iOS platform. The
    report system of the application generates PDF format reports and no other formats.
    Intense training is required to get adapted to the application since the interface
    is complex. Similarly, the information was interpreted for mobile applications
    Q, R, and S as represented in Fig. 2b–d. The main outcome of the study was arrived
    by comparing all four mobile applications and the same was represented in 3D as
    stipulated in Fig. 3, for better decision making and interpretation. It can be
    clearly seen that all four applications can be accessed via mobile and PC. Application
    R possess both analytical and hyperlinked dashboard whereas P and S possess only
    an analytical dashboard. Application Q has a non-analytical dashboard. Major technological
    features offered by application R are maximum as compared to P, Q, and S. Intimation
    system for applications P, R, and S consists of both email intimation and mobile-push
    notification whereas it is only email intimation for Q (Hussain et al. 2018).
    Similarly, applications P, R, and S are available on both android and iOS whereas
    Q is only available on android (Venkatraman and Yoong 2009). The report system
    of application R looks the best among others because it provides reports in different
    formats such as PDF, Excel, etc. Applications Q and R would be easier to use since
    they have a simple interface which will require moderate training to get adapted
    to in comparison to P and S (Sudharsan and Priyadharshni 2019). One of the affecting
    factor is the builders and contractors violating the guidelines of government
    policy (Okpala et al. 2020; Nnaji and Karakhan 2020). Fig. 3 Cumulative result
    of all applications Full size image Conclusion It was identified that with respect
    to quality management, checklists, and inspections, there are many solutions like
    A, B, C, D, P, Q, R, and S which are available in the market. The challenge is
    to find the most suitable, easy to use, simple, and economical application for
    your construction project. After performing a detailed quantitative and qualitative
    analysis on applications P, Q, R, and S, it can clearly be seen that the application
    R stands out and the same has been ranked 1st in the ranking matrix. The key advantages
    of application for R: It helps in improving co-ordination and communication by
    bringing all the team members on the same platform. It’s analytical-hyperlinked
    dashboard will help track project and employee performance. Users will not miss
    out on their tasks since features like ‘schedule’ and ‘mobile-push notification’
    will intimate them in prior. In-built GPS location and time-tracking system will
    increase accuracy of work. Its flexible reporting system will help exchange digital
    reports in multiple formats on both android and iOS devices. Above all the most
    important advantage is that the application has a simple interface which will
    require minimal training to get adapted and is cost beneficial. To increase the
    efficiency and productivity of construction projects, it is mandatory to adopt
    the automation (mobile application) criteria like R which possess several advantages.

    Preview Literature Review Agriculture automation is a significant issue and a
    changing problem for every location. Worldwide population is expanding quickly,
    and this growth in population is causing a tremendous expansion in the need for
    food. Farmers must employ more toxic pesticides in greater quantities in order
    to injure the soil since their traditional techniques are unable to meet the expanding
    demand. The ground still isn''t fertile as a result, and this has a significant
    impact on agriculture. Crop pests, a shortage of storehouse, pesticide regulation,
    plant supervision, irrigation, and water management are a few areas that have
    an impact on agricultural difficulties. All of this will be trumped by artificial
    intelligence. With much fewer meteorological data, two ANN models were constructed
    by (Liew, Y.W., et al., 2022) to predict soil moisture in Paddy regions. All models
    have been validated and put to the test via examination of observed soil and estimated
    soil humidity values. In order to replicate the spatial surface water flow, ANNs
    have been constructed in the (Onu, C.E. et al. 2022) study on neuro-drip irrigation
    systems. For the irrigation system to function properly, the distribution of water
    at the soil''s bottom layers is crucial. In this situation, ANNs provide a forecast
    which is helpful to the user and prompts a quick decision-generating technique.
    Embedded intelligence analytics (EI), a recent discipline, was established by
    (Bonetti, F., et al., 2022). The agricultural embedded intelligence includes smart
    planting, smart field production, smart irrigation, and complex greenhouses. Many
    industries rely on agriculture for a country to be able to develop these emerging
    technologies in the agricultural sector. Continue Reading References Follow Reference

    of disaster response efforts, thereby saving lives and reducing the economic impact
    of earthquakes. Finally, we identify research gaps in this domain and suggest
    future directions toward achieving a sustainable EEWS. Overall, this study provides
    valuable insights into the use of IoT and cloud infrastructure in earthquake disaster

    Introduction On 6 February 2023, a Mw 7.8 earthquake destroyed southern and central
    Turkey as well as northern and western Syria. 37 km (23 miles) west-northwest
    of Gaziantep is where the epicenter was. The earthquake near Antakya, Hatay Province,
    peaked with a Mercalli rating of XII (Extreme) as mentioned in [1]. The epicenter
    of the strong earthquake, followed by the one that occurred on February 6 by nine
    hours, was 95 km (59 miles) to the north-northeast of the most recent one. There
    was significant destruction and tens of thousands of deaths. At least 57,300 fatalities
    had been reported as of 20 March 2023, with more than 50,000 of those occurring
    in Turkey and more than 7200 in Syria [2]. It was the deadliest natural disaster
    in the history of Turkey and the largest natural disaster to hit Turkey in modern
    times since the earthquake in Antioch in 526 [3]. Aside from being the deadliest
    earthquake since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake in modern-day Syria, it was also the
    worst earthquake worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the sixth deadliest
    of the twenty-first century [4]. The fourth-costliest earthquakes on record, damages
    in Turkey were expected to total USD 104 billion, and in Syria, USD 5.1 billion
    [5]. There are strong correlations between earthquakes, climate changes, and mining
    activities [6,7,8]. Many scientists have predicted that the frequency of earthquakes
    will keep increasing [9]. Figure 1 illustrates the location of earthquakes that
    occurred in the last 12 months with intensity larger than 7 Moment W-phase (Mww).
    In [10], the first paper on the idea of earthquake early warning systems (EEWS)
    in 1985 was presented. These systems are networks of ground-based sensors that
    alert users when the earth starts to tremble. Figure 1. Major earthquakes that
    occurred in the last 12 months as reported in [11]. EEWS operates under the assumption
    that, despite the slow speed at which seismic waves move, electronic alerts from
    the epicenter region may be delivered almost instantly. The process is as follows:
    Several types of seismic waves radiate from an earthquake’s epicenter. Sensors
    are activated by P-waves, which are weaker but move more quickly. Thereafter,
    sensors send signals to cloud servers for processing. Algorithms in the cloud
    server instantly determine the location, magnitude, and severity of an earthquake.
    How big is it? Who will suffer from this? The technology sends out an alert before
    slower but more destructive S-waves and surface waves arrive. Those who are close
    to the epicenter will not receive much, if any, warning beforehand, while those
    who are farther away could only have a few seconds to brace themselves. EWS may
    help reduce some of the injuries and damage caused by large earthquakes when used
    in conjunction with automated countermeasures such as stopping trains or turning
    off gas lines. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of
    traditional as well as contemporary technology utilized in EEWSs [12,13,14]. As
    a consequence of this, effective integration of the numerous scientific fields
    is sought after in order to serve such crucial systems. In general, actions taken
    to reduce risks, conduct seismic hazard assessments, determine site specifications,
    and the like can be of assistance in this regard [15,16,17,18,19]. Developing
    a reliable EEWS necessitates solving a number of issues that are impacted by the
    ongoing difficulties associated with earthquake catastrophes. These issues include
    the observation of earthquake characteristics, and the environment type [20,21,22,23,24,25].
    Radio-frequency identification, satellite systems, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    network functions virtualization (NFV), 5G, software-defined networks (SDN), data
    networks, and a variety of other technologies have all been the focus of significant
    research in recent years in an effort to lessen the damage that earthquakes cause
    [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. For instance, satellite systems have been used to
    track earthquake movements, and IoT sensors have been used to detect earthquakes
    and provide early warnings. Furthermore, 5G and SDN technologies have been deployed
    for real-time communication and data transmission in emergency situations. These
    technologies have greatly enhanced the accuracy and speed of earthquake detection
    and warning systems and have improved the response time of emergency services.
    Moreover, the integration of robots and the internet has the potential to be a
    significant breakthrough in this field. According to [35], a new integrated system
    named “robot-event” has been proposed, which is able to execute autonomous inspections
    and emergency responses to a severe event. The robot uses real-time image tracking
    to inspect the indoor environment and help any human victims found on the ground.
    It operates in structurally sound houses with moderate damage, focusing on situations
    where people are at risk from falling furniture. The system was tested indoors
    to assess its functionality and operation alongside a smart EEWS. This new technology
    has the potential to significantly reduce the risk of human casualties during
    an earthquake by providing timely and accurate information to emergency responders.
    Future research in this area could explore further the use of robotics, artificial
    intelligence, and the internet to develop more advanced and efficient EEWSs. The
    research conducted in the literature regarding remote sensing applications facilitated
    by satellite communication systems did not cease with the studies by [36,37].
    It also encompassed NFV and SDN, which involved gateways via IoT as well as Micro-Electro-Mechanical
    systems (MEMS), as noted in [38,39,40,41]. The primary objective of this endeavor
    was to provide relief to areas that had suffered damage or destruction on a large
    scale. Virtualization played a critical role in this, as it could help mitigate
    the risks posed by natural disasters. As highlighted in [42], such networks must
    be designed to optimize node lifetimes. In addition, ref. [43] presented a tragic
    scenario that showcased an EEWS designed to facilitate a safe evacuation plan
    against disaster risks by combining cloud-based IoT with heterogeneous networks.
    Similarly, the combination of IoT and current communication technologies and techniques
    could prove to be crucial in ensuring the smooth and secure transfer of data,
    as stated in [44,45,46,47,48,49]. The studies mentioned here are accompanied by
    conventional approaches to earthquake detection and analysis, as well as methods
    for distinguishing between different types of fault ruptures, which have been
    extensively investigated in the relevant academic literature [50]. In [51], a
    local similarity earthquake detection approach based on the nearest neighbor method
    was proposed to determine whether an earthquake had occurred by examining the
    consistency of received signals from the nearest neighbors of targeted stations
    and their closest neighbors. On the other hand, refs. [52,53] focused more on
    determining the earthquake’s amplitude in the first few seconds of its occurrence
    rather than the complete rupture. However, conventional methods take a significant
    amount of time to calculate earthquake parameters [54], highlighting the need
    for additional efforts and studies. Early research suggests that it is possible
    to accurately predict the magnitude and depth of an earthquake using a graph CNN
    model that employs batch normalization and attention mechanism techniques. This
    model can be used in any location with any seismic nodes. The variability of seismic
    waves and the complexity of the Earth’s structure suggest that there is ample
    room for innovative and adaptable solutions. With the help of modern technologies,
    the impact of earthquakes on the studied region in [54] can be significantly reduced.
    An increasingly useful technology for disaster management is drones. They can
    be used to gather real-time data and give emergency responders situational awareness,
    which can aid in improved decision-making and more efficient responses. Drones
    with cameras and sensors can survey disaster regions swiftly and safely, collecting
    precise imagery and data that can be used to assess damage, spot areas that require
    immediate attention, and organize rescue and recovery efforts [55]. Drones can
    also be used to transport people in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations necessary
    goods such as food and medical supplies [56]. Drones are an important tool in
    emergency management because they have the potential to greatly speed up and enhance
    the efficiency of disaster response efforts. 5G and B5G networks offer several
    advantages for emergency communication, including faster data transmission speeds,
    lower latency, and improved reliability [57,58,59]. These networks can enable
    real-time communication between emergency responders and affected individuals,
    as well as the seamless transfer of data and video feeds from IoT devices, such
    as sensors and drones [60,61,62]. In particular, D2D communication can play a
    crucial role in emergency situations, as it allows devices to communicate directly
    with each other without relying on a centralized network [63,64]. This can be
    especially useful in scenarios where network infrastructure may be damaged or
    overloaded, as D2D communication can operate on a peer-to-peer basis and bypass
    the need for a central network [65,66]. In an earthquake early warning system,
    D2D communication could allow sensors to share data with each other and trigger
    alerts in real-time without relying on a centralized system [67,68]. Edge computing
    can also be leveraged to enhance the performance of earthquake early warning systems
    [69,70]. By processing data closer to the source, edge computing can reduce the
    amount of data that needs to be transmitted to centralized servers and enable
    faster response times [71,72]. For example, in an earthquake early warning system
    that uses drones to collect data, edge computing could be used to process the
    data on the drones themselves, rather than transmitting it back to a central server
    for processing [73,74]. This would not only reduce the amount of data that needs
    to be transmitted but also enable faster response times in the event of an earthquake
    [75]. Cloud computing helps manage disasters. Disaster management firms can swiftly
    deploy vital apps and services to assist emergency response activities using cloud
    platforms’ scalability, flexibility, and accessibility. Cloud-based technologies
    can monitor and analyze disaster data in real time, helping emergency responders
    manage resources. Cloud systems can store and handle enormous volumes of data,
    such as maps, satellite imaging, and social media feeds, to help businesses better
    analyze disasters. Cloud-based communication and collaboration solutions can also
    help rescuers communicate, coordinate, and stay linked during the pandemonium.
    Cloud computing may make disaster management businesses more agile, responsive,
    and effective in saving lives and minimizing damage. Fog and edge computing are
    distributed computing methods that provide computing resources near data sources.
    Fog computing is a dispersed computing infrastructure that processes data near
    its source. Edge computing brings computing resources to the end-user or device.
    Fog and edge computing are important in natural disaster detection and control.
    Natural disasters damage communication networks, making data collection and transmission
    difficult. Fog and edge computing provide local data processing and analysis without
    data centers or clouds. In the aftermath of a disaster, time is of the essence
    because communication infrastructure may be compromised [76,77,78,79]. For example,
    sensors deployed in an area prone to flooding can collect data on water levels,
    flow rates, and other factors that can help predict and manage the impact of a
    flood. By using edge and fog computing, this data can be analyzed in real-time,
    allowing for EWS to be put in place and emergency responders to be deployed more
    quickly [80]. Similarly, sensors can be used to detect seismic activity and predict
    earthquakes, with data processed locally to provide early warning and minimize
    damage. Overall, fog and edge computing play an important role in natural disaster
    detection and management by enabling real-time data processing and analysis at
    the edge of the network [81]. This approach can help improve the speed and accuracy
    of disaster response, ultimately leading to better outcomes for affected communities.
    Verification and validation (V&V) techniques are crucial for ensuring the quality,
    reliability, and security of software systems in the context of IoT and cloud
    computing [82,83]. These systems involve a complex network of devices, sensors,
    and services that must work together seamlessly and securely [84]. V&V techniques
    provide a framework for testing and validating these systems, ensuring that they
    meet the specified requirements and perform as intended. By implementing V&V techniques,
    developers can identify and correct defects and errors before they cause significant
    problems, ultimately leading to higher quality and more reliable IoT and cloud
    systems [85]. In [86], the authors reviewed geospatial and remote sensing technologies
    in earthquake research and disaster management, analyzing their historical and
    future applications, limitations, and methodologies. It provides a framework for
    earthquake hazard, vulnerability, and risk analysis using geospatial technologies.
    In [87], the study examined remote sensing applications, including Landsat satellite
    imaging, LiDAR, optical satellite photography, InSAR, and DEMETER in earthquake
    research. Many other studies [88,89,90] explore the role of IoT in disaster management
    and compares IoT-based options for various calamities. It highlights IoT EWS for
    fires and earthquakes and advises stakeholders on leveraging IoT technology to
    secure smart cities’ infrastructure and minimize risks. The studies also evaluate
    Caribbean DRM (Disaster and Risk Management) systems, emphasizing the need for
    technology and new methods in monitoring disaster risks in small island states.
    It assesses technology in the five DRM pillars and proposes improvements for technology
    adoption in the Caribbean subregion. The research contributes to the global discussion
    on technology and innovation in DRM and addresses sustainable development concerns
    in Caribbean SIDS (Small Islands Developing States). The review paper [91] explores
    building damage mapping techniques in post-earthquake scenarios, emphasizing machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning frameworks. It addresses the drawbacks of manual
    interpretation of remote sensing imagery and identifies research gaps. The study
    of [92] reviews remote sensing methods for earthquake risk assessment, highlighting
    the importance of vulnerability assessment and the need for a comprehensive approach.
    In [93], satellite remote sensing technology for EEWS is suggested to achieve
    more improvements for EWS. The research of [94] examines post-earthquake damage
    investigation using optical remote sensing data and change detection algorithms,
    discussing their challenges and potential. The authors in [95] analyze how emerging
    technologies improve disaster management processes and call for further investigation.
    Lastly, the work done in [96] presents a procedure for managing pre- and post-earthquake
    stages of structure management using digital tools and emphasizes the role of
    BIM models and IDM standards. Compared to previous works, our paper presents a
    comprehensive overview of the role of EEWS in disaster assessment and relief,
    specifically focusing on the use of IoT networks and cloud infrastructure. The
    paper provides fundamental concepts about seismic waves and associated signal
    processing, details on the EEWS IoT system, and a taxonomy of EEWS approaches
    using emerging IoT and cloud facilities. Additionally, our paper elaborates on
    a generic IoT-enabled EEWS architecture, discusses drones’ role in disaster management,
    and provides a summary of the primary verification and validation (V&V) methods
    required for the systems under consideration. Finally, the paper describes research
    gaps in this research domain and provides future directions. While previous papers
    have discussed geospatial technologies, remote sensing, and social media platforms’
    use in earthquake research, disaster management, and catastrophe response, our
    paper focuses on the role of IoT and cloud infrastructure in EEWS and provides
    a comprehensive overview of the many elements needed to realize an EEWS. Table
    1 is intended to provide a comparison of our work with previous works in the field
    of earthquake research and disaster management. It summarizes the main focus,
    methodology, and contributions of each paper, highlighting the unique contributions

    usage, as well as the IoT system framework in general and its constituent parts.

    open challenges, concludes the work, and identifies some potential future work
    directions. 2. Seismic Waves and Seismic Signal Processing Techniques Seismic
    activity is a key subject of investigation. Understanding how different types
    of structures respond to earthquake loads and finding out how to safeguard occupants
    of a structure in an earthquake are both aided by this knowledge. The study of
    seismicity can help us better understand the many seismic wave types that are
    generated, allowing us to map both the regions that are earthquake-prone and those
    that are not. Studying a region’s seismic activity aids in establishing minimum
    safety requirements for that area, making it simpler for life to go on after an
    earthquake [97,98]. Acoustic energy, known as a seismic wave, can move through
    the Earth or another planetary body. It could be caused by a quake (or an earthquake
    more generally), a volcanic eruption, the movement of magma, a big landslide,
    or a sizable explosion brought on by human activity, such as mining, which releases
    low-frequency acoustic energy. Seismologists are responsible for investigating
    seismic waves. To record the waves, seismologists use accelerometers, hydrophones,
    or seismometers that are submerged in water [99]. It is important to differentiate
    seismic waves from seismic noise, also known as ambient vibration, which is characterized
    by a continuous low-amplitude vibration and can be caused by a wide variety of
    natural and artificial sources. Arrays of sensors are typically used in seismic
    signal processing, which is followed by signal conditioning and data fusion. An
    ADC converter is then used to digitize the gathered data, and a microcontroller
    is used to process it. This is referred to as an IoT node in the context of the
    IoT, and it is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. IoT sensor node for EEWS. It is possible
    to differentiate between the two types of seismic waves known as body waves, which
    move through the inside of the planet, and surface waves, which move along the
    surface of the planet. Body waves flow through the interior of the Earth in a
    manner that is determined by the paths that are created by material properties
    such as density and modulus (stiffness). Temperature, chemical composition, and
    the state of the material all have an effect on the material’s modulus and density.
    This phenomenon can be compared to the refraction of light waves. On the basis
    of how particles move, body waves can be divided into two distinct categories:
    primary and secondary waves. Around the year 1830, the French mathematician Siméon
    Denis Poisson identified this distinction as follows [100]: Primary waves, also
    referred to as P-waves, are longitudinal compressional waves that move through
    the earth in a straight line. These waves are known as “primary” waves because
    they arrive first at seismograph stations, traveling faster through the earth
    than other types of waves. P-waves are pressure waves that can travel through
    any material, including fluids, and move at a speed that is around 1.7 times faster
    than that of S-waves. In contrast to S-waves, which are transverse waves that
    move side-to-side, P-waves are compression waves that cause particles in the material
    they are traveling through to move back and forth in the direction of the wave’s
    propagation. They take the form of sound waves in the air and move at the same
    velocity as sound waves, which is around 330 m per second on average. The ability
    of P-waves to travel through any material allows them to be used to study the
    interior of the earth. By measuring the time taken for P-waves to travel through
    the earth from an earthquake’s epicenter to a seismograph station, scientists
    can calculate information about the earth’s internal structure. For example, the
    average speed of P-waves in granite is roughly 5000 m per second, while in water,
    it is around 1450 m per second. This information can be used to create a detailed
    model of the Earth’s interior. S-waves, also known as secondary shear waves, are
    transverse waves that cause the ground to shift in a direction perpendicular to
    their propagation during an earthquake. These waves arrive at seismograph stations
    after P-waves, which are faster. S-waves have a horizontal polarization and move
    in a horizontal direction, causing the ground to shift from side to side. However,
    S-waves can only travel through solids since liquids and gases do not support
    shear forces. They move through any solid medium at a speed that is approximately
    60% slower than P-waves. The absence of S-waves in the outer core of the Earth
    is consistent with the presence of liquid. This is because S-waves cannot propagate
    through liquids, and their absence indicates that the outer core is predominantly
    liquid. However, P-waves can propagate through liquids, which is why they can
    travel through the entire Earth. The study of seismic waves and their behavior
    has provided scientists with valuable insights into the structure and composition
    of the Earth’s interior. The path that seismic surface waves take along the surface
    of the Earth [101]. These are an example of a type of surface wave known as mechanical
    surface waves. They are referred to as surface waves because their strength decreases
    as they go away from the ocean’s surface. They move at a much slower pace compared
    to seismic body waves (P and S). The amplitude of surface waves can reach several
    millimeters during particularly powerful earthquakes. Seismographs that are situated
    at a greater distance from the epicenter of an earthquake are unable to detect
    the high frequencies of the first P wave. In contrast, seismographs that are situated
    closer to the epicenter are able to record both the P and S waves that are generated
    when an earthquake takes place [102]. The problems that are associated with seismic
    data are probably unmatched by any others. During the course of the past few decades,
    the amounts of such data have nearly multiplied exponentially [103]. In recent
    acquisition studies, petabits of data are being processed on a daily basis. This
    requires massive processing capabilities. It should, therefore, not come as a
    surprise that data formats have evolved significantly over the years and that
    they have been altered to meet particular workflows or software solutions, which
    has added to the complexity of managing data [104]. In recent years, the industry
    of exploration and production has been dealing with “big data” in the form of
    seismic data [105]. This data is collected during seismic surveys. As more and
    more varieties of data are gathered and reprocessed for a variety of purposes,
    the amount and volume of data continue to grow at an alarming rate. It is necessary
    to locate and manage both field and prestack data because new insights can be
    derived from old data by applying updated seismic processing methods. Because
    of this, it is important to keep track of both sets of data. Several companies
    made the decision to store this information on tapes because of the massive size
    of seismic data files and the prohibitively expensive cost of disk space. However,
    tapes were difficult to handle and regularly went missing, so this was not an
    ideal solution. Web-based viewers and administration tools make it easier to discover
    and handle data from anywhere in the world. At the same time, tiered storage and
    cloud storage offer new and more cost-effective means of keeping enormous seismic
    datasets [106]. Figure 3 shows the enhancements of the utilized earthquake measurement.
    Figure 3. Earthquake measurement evolution. Seismic wave analysis is a key component
    of earthquake early warning systems, as it enables the detection and characterization
    of seismic waves in real-time [107,108]. One of the most widely used signal processing
    techniques in seismic wave analysis is the Fourier transform, which is used to
    transform time-domain signals into frequency-domain signals [109,110]. In earthquake
    early warning systems, the Fourier transform is often used to analyze the spectral
    content of seismic waves, which can provide important information about the location,
    magnitude, and duration of an earthquake [111]. The Fourier transform is also
    used to filter out noise and unwanted signals from seismic data, improving the
    accuracy of earthquake detection and analysis [112]. Another advanced signal processing
    technique used in seismic wave analysis is wavelet analysis, which is used to
    analyze signals that are both time-varying and non-stationary [113,114,115]. In
    earthquake early warning systems, wavelet analysis is often used to detect and
    analyze seismic waves that have complex frequency components, such as those generated
    by slow earthquakes or volcanic activity [116,117]. By decomposing a seismic waveform
    into its constituent frequency components, wavelet analysis can provide more detailed
    information on the characteristics of seismic waves, such as their frequency content,
    duration, and amplitude [118,119]. In addition to these advanced signal processing
    techniques, earthquake early warning systems also rely on a variety of specific
    parameters to optimize their performance [120,121]. These parameters include sampling
    rates, window sizes, and filter cutoff frequencies, among others. Sampling rates
    determine how often seismic data is collected and stored, while window sizes determine
    the length of time over which seismic data is analyzed. Filter cutoff frequencies
    determine which frequency components of a seismic waveform are analyzed and are
    often used to remove noise and unwanted signals from seismic data. In conclusion,
    earthquake early warning systems rely on a variety of advanced signal processing
    techniques and specific parameters to detect and analyze seismic waves in real
    time. By providing more detailed information on these techniques and parameters,
    we aim to enhance the technical rigor of our paper and improve the understanding
    of the underlying technology. By optimizing the performance of earthquake early
    warning systems through advanced signal processing techniques and specific parameters,
    we can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of these systems, ultimately helping
    to save lives and reduce the impact of earthquakes on communities. 3. IoT-Cloud
    Systems 3.1. IoT Systems The IoT is gaining increasing support as a viable new
    technology throughout the world [122,123]. An IoT is a system that relies on connected
    embedded items or gadgets that have identifiers and are able to interact with
    one another without the assistance of humans using a common communication protocol.
    It has been reported that there are more internet-connected devices on the earth
    than there are humans, where these devices support the smart cities establishment
    [124,125,126]. Some smart cities are already in existence [127]. The growth of
    intelligent technology is outlined on Statista’s website [128] under Figure 4.
    As has been suggested, an enormous increase in smart homes as well as commercial
    buildings, and important requirements for these buildings will include intelligent
    electricity and water management [129]. Statista projects that the number of IoT
    devices will nearly triple between 2020 and 2030, going from 9.7 billion in 2020
    to more than 29 billion in 2030. Over 5 billion consumer IoT devices are expected
    to exist in China by 2030. Accordingly, it is the nation with the majority of
    these devices. Consumer markets make use of IoT devices; nevertheless, it is anticipated
    that the consumer market will account for more than 60 percent of all IoT-connected
    devices by the year 2020 [128]. For the next decade, it is anticipated that this
    proportion will not change from its current value. Figure 4. Estimated growth
    of IoT nodes. According to [130,131,132,133,134], several industry verticals now
    have more than 100 million connected IoT devices, including government, retail
    and wholesale, transportation and storage, electricity, steam, gas, air conditioning,
    waste management, water supply, and retail and wholesale. It is predicted that
    by 2030, over 8,000,000 IoT nodes will be employed in all industries [128]. In
    addition, cell phones can represent the best contributor to IoT nodes. Interestingly,
    it is expected to reach nearly 17 billion by 2030, and more than one billion would
    be used to connected (autonomous) vehicles [128], information technology infrastructure,
    asset tracking and monitoring, and smart grids [135,136,137]. While configuring
    an IoT system, the following steps should be carried out in accordance with established
    industry standards [138,139,140,141,142,143]: Providing the node with an interface
    that can collect data from the environment. Providing a tool for acquiring and
    analyzing data in order to derive knowledge from it. Taking action and communicating
    choices and information to the appropriate hubs. To gain a comprehensive understanding
    of an IoT solution’s architecture, it is necessary to examine multiple IoT systems.
    As shown in Figure 5, an IoT system’s framework typically consists of a sensor
    network that monitors changes in the surrounding environment. Depending on the
    required transmission speed and distance, the collected stream should be transmitted
    to a centralized or decentralized administration using, e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth,
    Tmote Sky, 4G, etc. It is important to note that the sensor system needs a continuous
    source of electricity, and the choice of connectivity is influenced by power consumption,
    with mobile service requiring more power than WiFi, 474.67 to 576.64 mW and 1254.3
    to 1540.6 mW, respectively [144]. Safety considerations for both hardware and
    connectivity are also crucial. An IoT system’s data is reviewed or saved in the
    cloud system to identify patterns and extrapolate information, a critical requirement
    for any IoT system. The data can be simplified using data visualization, and alert
    systems can be implemented to provide appropriate levels of caution to users.
    It is essential that IoT system design is not limited to industry professionals
    only. Figure 5. A general IoT system paradigm. The IoT has the potential to revolutionize
    methods of detecting and managing disasters. With the help of IoT devices, we
    can collect real-time data on various environmental factors such as temperature,
    humidity, air pressure, and wind speed, which can help us detect natural disasters
    such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. These devices can also monitor infrastructure
    such as bridges, dams, and buildings for any signs of damage or weakness and alert
    authorities before they collapse or fail, preventing further damage and loss of
    life. Moreover, IoT can aid disaster management by providing real-time updates
    on the affected areas, helping authorities plan and allocate resources effectively.
    Smart sensors and cameras can be deployed to assess the extent of the damage in
    disaster-stricken areas, and drones can be used to reach inaccessible areas and
    gather more information. This data can be analyzed using ML algorithms to identify
    patterns and predict future disasters [145,146], improving the accuracy of EWS
    and minimizing the impact of disasters. Another significant advantage of IoT in
    disaster management is its ability to facilitate communication between emergency
    responders and victims. Wearable devices and mobile apps can help victims send
    alerts and SOS messages, and responders can use IoT devices to locate and rescue
    survivors in real time. IoT can also help in tracking the movements of rescue
    teams and ensuring their safety. The use of IoT for disaster detection and management
    has the potential to save countless lives and minimize the impact of disasters.
    By leveraging IoT devices to collect real-time data, authorities can detect disasters
    early, manage resources effectively, and respond quickly to save lives. However,
    it is crucial to address concerns about data privacy and security to ensure the
    safe and ethical use of IoT in disaster management. Drones, also known as unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs), have come a long way since their inception in the early
    20th century [147]. Initially used for military purposes, drones have evolved
    and diversified over time, and today they have a wide range of applications in
    various fields, including photography, agriculture, search and rescue, and disaster
    management [148]. In addition, it can be equipped with thermal imaging sensors
    that can also be used to detect the presence of survivors in collapsed buildings
    or other hard-to-reach areas [149]. There are several types of drones (Figure
    6), each with unique characteristics and capabilities. The most common types of
    drones are fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and hybrid drones. Fixed-wing drones are similar
    to airplanes and can fly for longer distances, while rotary-wing drones, also
    known as quadcopters, are more agile and can hover in place. Hybrid drones combine
    features of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing drones, providing a balance between
    endurance and agility. Figure 6. Different types of UAVs. Drones can be involved
    in various types of communications (Figure 7), including visual, auditory, and
    data communication. Visual communication involves transmitting images and videos
    captured by the drone’s camera to a remote operator or a ground station. Auditory
    communication can include transmitting audio messages, such as warnings or instructions,
    to individuals or groups on the ground via a speaker on the drone. Data communication
    involves transmitting data, such as telemetry and sensor readings, between the
    drone and a ground station or another device. Additionally, drones can be equipped
    with communication technologies such as satellite communication, Wi-Fi, and cellular
    networks to enable long-range communication and control. In [150], the authors
    exploited the UAVs to collect data for disaster management relying on 5G (fifth
    generation) and B5G (beyond 5G) systems with their huge capacity in terms of different
    data types. The authors investigated various literature solutions to some UAV
    issues, such as energy harvesting and security. For example, they mentioned a
    sample method that used UAVs to find the most suitable localization of the sensor
    nodes for optimizing Quality of Service. Figure 7. Possible types of communications
    between UAVs and end-users. In recent years, advances in technology have enabled
    the integration of new sensing and data collection methods into EEWS systems,
    including the use of drones [151,152]. Drone-based sensing can provide high-resolution
    data on earthquake characteristics, such as ground motion and deformation, which
    can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of EEWS systems [153,154]. The main
    advantages and limitations of the use of drones is summarized in Table 2. Table
    2. Main Advantages and Limitations of Drones. Real-time communication is also
    essential for the timely dissemination of earthquake alerts, and various communication
    technologies, including satellite and wireless networks, are used to transmit
    sensor data and alerts to processing centers and end-users [155]. In addition,
    the integration of EEWS systems with IoT and cloud infrastructure can provide
    scalability, fault-tolerance, and data processing capabilities [156]. IoT devices,
    such as accelerometers and GPS sensors, can provide additional data sources for
    earthquake monitoring and analysis. In contrast, cloud infrastructure can provide
    storage and processing capabilities for large-scale data analysis and modeling
    [157]. Coordination between these various technical aspects is essential for the
    successful deployment and operation of EEWS systems, and careful consideration
    of their capabilities, limitations, and interdependencies is necessary to ensure
    their effectiveness in mitigating the impact of earthquakes [158]. 3.2. Cloud
    and Fog Systems Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources,
    such as servers, storage, databases, and software, over the internet on an on-demand
    basis [159]. It provides users with easy access to a wide range of computing resources
    that can be scaled up or down based on demand without requiring users to invest
    in and maintain their own physical infrastructure. Fog computing, on the other
    hand, is a distributed computing model that brings computing resources closer
    to the edge of the network, closer to where data is generated and consumed, and
    provides real-time processing and decision-making capabilities [160]. The importance
    of cloud and fog computing in natural disaster detection and management cannot
    be overstated. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and
    wildfires can cause widespread devastation and loss of life. The use of cloud
    and fog computing in disaster management can help to mitigate the effects of these
    disasters by providing real-time data analysis, decision-making, and communication
    capabilities [161]. Cloud computing can be used to store and process large amounts
    of data generated by sensors and other devices used in disaster management. This
    data can be analyzed in real-time, providing EWS to alert authorities and the
    public of impending disasters. Cloud computing can also be used to store and share
    critical data such as emergency response plans, evacuation routes, and contact
    information for emergency services. Fog computing can be used to process and analyze
    data at the edge of the network, near the source of the data. This can provide
    real-time information about the status of infrastructure such as roads, bridges,
    and buildings, allowing authorities to make informed decisions about evacuation
    and emergency response efforts. Fog computing can also be used to provide real-time
    communication capabilities, allowing emergency services to coordinate their efforts
    and communicate with each other and the public in real time. In summary, cloud
    and fog computing play a critical role in natural disaster detection and management.
    They provide real-time data analysis, decision-making, and communication capabilities,
    allowing authorities to respond quickly and effectively to disasters, potentially
    saving countless lives and minimizing the damage caused by these events. 4. IoT-Cloud-Based
    EEWS This section will highlight the significant significance that the IoT-Cloud
    technology plays in EEWS. In point of fact, the application of IoT-Cloud strategies
    has been of assistance to EEWS before and after disasters. The IoT has revolutionized
    the way we interact with the physical world, and one of its most promising applications
    is in the detection and prediction of natural disasters such as earthquakes. The
    basic idea behind using IoT for earthquake detection is to deploy a network of
    sensors that can detect seismic activity and transmit the data to a central server
    for analysis. These sensors can be embedded in buildings, bridges, and other structures,
    as well as in the ground itself. By analyzing the data from these sensors, it
    is possible to detect the onset of an earthquake and predict its magnitude and
    location. One of the key advantages of using IoT for earthquake detection is that
    it allows for real-time monitoring of seismic activity. Traditional methods of
    earthquake detection rely on seismometers, which are expensive and require a lot
    of maintenance. They also typically only provide data after an earthquake has
    already occurred. In contrast, IoT sensors can provide continuous data in real-time,
    allowing for EWS to be put in place [162,163,164]. This can be particularly useful
    in areas prone to earthquakes, where early warning can save lives and reduce damage.
    Another advantage of using IoT for earthquake detection is that it can provide
    more denser data network than traditional methods. IoT sensors can be placed in
    a wider variety of locations, such as inside buildings or underground, allowing
    for a more comprehensive picture of seismic activity. They can also provide data
    on other factors that can affect the impact of an earthquake, such as soil conditions
    and building materials. This information can be used to develop better models
    for earthquake prediction and to design buildings and infrastructure that are
    more resistant to seismic activity. The use of IoT for earthquake detection has
    the potential to revolutionize the way we prepare for and respond to earthquakes.
    By providing real-time data and more comprehensive information on seismic activity,
    IoT sensors can improve our ability to predict earthquakes and minimize their
    impact. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see more widespread
    deployment of IoT sensors and more sophisticated analysis techniques, leading
    to even better earthquake detection and prediction capabilities. A generic EEWS
    architecture typically consists of three main components: the seismic network,
    the processing center, and the alert distribution system [165]. The seismic network
    comprises a set of sensors deployed across a region of interest, which detect
    and record seismic waves generated by earthquakes. The sensor data is transmitted
    to the processing center, where it is analyzed in real-time using algorithms and
    models to estimate the location, magnitude, and other characteristics of the earthquake
    [166]. The alert distribution system then disseminates the earthquake alert to
    end-users through various channels, such as mobile devices, sirens, and public
    announcements [167]. The underlying infrastructure of the EEWS includes a variety
    of hardware and software components, including seismometers, communication networks,
    computing systems, and databases [168]. The seismometers are typically deployed
    in a dense network to ensure high spatial resolution and coverage, and they are
    connected to a communication network that transmits the sensor data to the processing
    center [169]. The processing center comprises a set of computing systems that
    perform real-time data analysis, using a variety of algorithms and models to estimate
    the earthquake parameters [170]. The alert distribution system includes a set
    of communication channels and protocols that disseminate the alert to end-users,
    as well as a database that stores historical and real-time earthquake data [171].
    The interactions between these components are tightly coordinated to ensure timely
    and accurate earthquake alerts, which can help to mitigate the impact of earthquakes
    and save lives [172]. In [173], the authors developed CrowdQuake, a DL-based seismic
    detection system. Utilizing a dense IoT network composed of MEMS nodes, the system
    employs a multi-head convolution neural network to analyze a large quantity of
    observed acceleration data. During the model validation procedure, the scientists
    got data from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention
    (NIED) and measured the precision-recall, accuracy, and noise level. The developed
    system could process data from up to 8000 IoT sensors, and identifying an earthquake
    required only a few seconds of processing time, according to the researchers.
    In [174], an advanced EEWS supported by an IoT network that operates on the basis
    of real-time alerts has been established. The network utilized MEMS accelerometers
    and an Arduino Cortex M4 CPU for measuring acceleration. This technique employs
    ML to improve the accuracy and latency in earthquake detection. The model was
    constructed using data gathered locally by the MEMS accelerometer nodes that were
    installed. In [175], IoT acceleration nodes were designed explicitly for earthquake
    detection. Two methods are used to utilize these nodes: a technique of standalone
    and a technique of client-server. The first technique is more commonly used, while
    the client-server technique is more precise but requires high-performance servers
    and network infrastructure to manage data acceleration from multiple client machines.
    Basic earthquake detection methods can be independently explored on less capable
    mobile nodes. However, this may result in false alarms. To overcome this limitation,
    a cooperative method that uses a large number of mobile phones located in close
    proximity to one another is employed. This creates a seismic network that can
    detect earthquakes and monitors any shaking caused by human activity, mechanical
    vibrations, earthquakes, etc. By relying on a primary neural network, a motion
    similar to an earthquake detected by a smartphone is transmitted to other cellphones
    in the immediate area using a multi-hop mode. Furthermore, every mobile phone
    in the network determines and notifies the network of an earthquake, then triggers
    an alarm after obtaining detection data from other smartphones in its immediate
    vicinity. This technique improves the earthquake detection capabilities of a standalone
    method that does not use any system or network infrastructures. In [176], a predictive
    model that combines IoT devices and ML techniques was used to detect geological
    landslide occurrences. The predictive model was trained with geotechnical parameters
    such as soil shear strength, soil moisture, rain intensity, terrain slope, and
    more. The actual hardware used for this purpose consisted of a collection of sensors
    that gathered real-time information on the topography and soil. In [177], the
    authors proposed a compute offloading system architecture that can be implemented
    on Internet-connected drones. They conducted an in-depth experimental study to
    compare the efficiency of cloud computing offloading strategy with that of the
    edge computing strategy for DL solutions in the context of unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs). The authors investigated the balance between the computational cost of
    the two alternative options communications in an experiment. In [53], a DL paradigm
    based on integrating autoencoder (AE) and CNN was developed to immediately determine
    earthquake magnitude and position three seconds after the P-wave begins. The authors
    referred to it as CNN and 3s AE (3S-AE-CNN). The data set used in the study was
    monitored by three stations of the Hi-net seismic network in Japan, and the approach
    was evaluated using data from 12,200 separate occurrences (109.80 thousand 3 s
    three-component seismic windows). The model simplifies the extraction of essential
    waveform properties, resulting in a higher degree of credibility in earthquake
    parameter assessment. The suggested model predicts magnitude, latitude, and longitude
    with an accuracy of within 28 × 10 −6 , 3.3 × 10 −6 , and 100 × 10 −6 degrees,
    respectively. That model immediately communicates event features to a sink IoT
    node. It provides guidance to the relevant administration on how to proceed. It
    is noted that AE has proved beneficial in feature extraction regardless of the
    application [178]. The framework for earthquake prediction proposed in [179] is
    a novel approach based on federated learning (FL). This FL framework outperformed
    the previously developed ML model for earthquake estimation through an IoT gateway
    in terms of reliability and accuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% by
    analyzing multidimensional data over a 100 km radial area, excluding the Western
    Himalayas, and studying the data. In [180], an EEW based on an IoT and an ML model
    was suggested to predict tsunamis using tsunami data dating back to 2100 BC and
    was trained on earthquake parameters in the dataset. It achieved an accuracy of
    95% in predicting earthquake location, depth, and magnitude. In [181], a DL approach
    that can identify P-waves despite background noise was developed using MEMS for
    observing events. The model can detect the probability of occurring preceding
    significant shocks and accurately predict P-waves between 1.5 and 2.5 s before
    their arrival. In [182], the authors used detector nodes to detect earthquakes
    locally by probing the environment and assessing data from probes in the surrounding
    area. The method stores all data locally, making it resistant to node failures
    and partial network outages, thus increasing privacy. The test network consisted
    of twenty node codes joined with ten neighbor nodes chosen at random. The total
    number of detectors was sampled every ten seconds. In [183], a Multilayer Perceptron-classifier
    was developed to provide a severity-based warning by predicting the possibility
    of an onsite intensity exceeding a pre-trained PGA threshold associated with damaging
    intensities on the MMI scale—seismic properties observed by the strong-motion
    signal starting from the P-wave in the developed model. The authors of [184] proposed
    an independent model of earthquake detection via low-cost acceleration nodes.
    The model utilized four different sensor types for establishing an EEWS with different
    types of data, e.g., noise from buildings, vibrations, and earthquake records.
    To test the sensors, two actual earthquakes were replicated on a shake table.
    The study found that low-cost acceleration sensors can detect earthquakes by monitoring
    differences in acceleration induced by a range between 0.02 g to 0.8 g, which
    can be detected by the sensors. Therefore, the authors used scaled data within
    that range. An ML methodology with earthquake characteristics was utilized, as
    opposed to the more conventional seismic methodologies that are typically used
    [185,186,187]. The authors broke the detection problem down into two distinct
    groups, namely, static settings and dynamic settings. They provide the most effective
    ML approach and input data for the static environment based on an experimental
    evaluation of numerous features for circumventing the issue of discriminating
    earthquake and noise components to reduce the number of false alarms. This model
    was validated with the help of 385 earthquakes ranging in magnitude from 4.0 to
    8.0. The authors of the paper [188] introduced the Distributed Multi-Sensor Earthquake
    Early Warning (DMSEEW) system as a cutting-edge ML-based technique that includes
    data from GPS stations and earthquake sensors in order to recognize large and
    medium earthquakes. The model relies on an innovative stacking ensemble technique
    that has been validated by geoscientists using a real-world dataset. This approach
    was used to build DMSEEW. The architecture of the system was designed to be regionally
    spread, which allows for both brisk processing and resistance to disruptions in
    some aspects of the underlying infrastructure. To be more specific, these systems
    combined GPS and seismic data in order to enhance earthquake detection, which
    led to the creation of an efficient EEWS. Karacı [189] used vibration sensors
    for earthquake detection according to some threshold values. If an earthquake
    has been detected via the vibration sensors, a warning system takes place. In
    this warning system, there is a Wi-Fi module for Internet connection to send a
    tweet by means of the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform service. There is also
    a sound alarm via a buzzer for the people staying around the earthquake area.
    Thus, the electronic part of this study covers an Arduino card, Wi-Fi module,
    Inertial Measurement Unit sensor, vibration sensor card, and buzzer. The software
    part involves the codes of Processing with Arduino to obtain the sensor data normalization
    and the difference between sequential sensor values for monitoring the threshold
    level. Babu and Rajan [190] have studied an IoT solution that alerts for a flood
    or earthquake detection before they happen and living beings being searched for
    during the disasters. Sensors are connected to a microcontroller, RF transmitter,
    and receiver. Their values are analyzed in real-time via ThingSpeak IoT analytics
    platform service [190]. The authorities are notified by GSM messages during a
    flood or earthquake disaster using the IP protocol. A water level sensor has been
    used for flood detection, and four color bulbs represent the danger levels. A
    rain sensor has worked to determine whether there is rain. Additionally, a vibration
    sensor has been used for an earthquake. The system and the mobile phones are charged
    with solar energy as a secure option for flood environments. ESP Wi-Fi module
    is the gateway as the fundamental processing and storage part between the RF receiver-transmitter-bulb
    system and ThingSpeak cloud server for sensor data transmission. This data can
    be followed using a ThingSpeak API that is used for mobile phones, laptops, or
    any other internet-connected device. Wireless communication, especially GPS, is
    used for living being searches. Won et al. [191] proposed a high-fidelity vibration
    sensor consisting of a MEMS accelerometer with high sampling frequency and digital
    filtering. During the sensing process, Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average trigger
    is compared with a threshold value. Over the threshold, data acquisition, low-pass
    filtering, and downsampling to a frequency are performed. After this procedure,
    if an earthquake is detected with the proposed algorithm, the system notifies
    it through a Bluetooth Beacon. The authors mentioned that the hardware platform
    was Adafruit nRF52840 Feather Express developed based on nRF52840 (Nordic, 2019)
    board having fast computing and high storage attributes provided by CPU, RAM,
    and flash parts. Additionally, the nRF52840 module has Bluetooth 5 and Arduino
    IDE support. Duggal et al. [192] mentioned that the literature studies could not
    separate any other vibrational noise properly from that of earthquakes. They proposed
    a new method by using IoT to eliminate this drawback. A Micro Electro-mechanical
    system sensor is set inside a building after finding the most suitable place via
    structural analysis with the information on seismic shear walls. Inside this sensor,
    there is an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The gyroscope saves the ground’s shaking
    pattern, representing a distinctive nature during an earthquake. IoT I 2 C Communication
    Protocol is used between the devices in the network. Arduino Uno microcontroller
    board and NodeMCU Dev Kit firmware have interfaces with the sensor node. The sensor
    data is sent by Arduino inbuilt WiFi to the ML side. In this part, Logistic Regression,
    Support Vector Machine, and Convolutional Neural Networks have been used for modeling.
    Sharma et al. [89] gave a table for ten different IoT disaster management systems
    based on several properties, such as IoT architecture ownership, cloud-enabled,
    computer technology area, main focus, and disaster type. They also classified
    IoT-based disaster recovery systems into four groups: Service-oriented, natural,
    artificial, and post-disaster. They compared IoT-enabled disaster management methods
    according to their wireless communication technologies, sensor types, and some
    additional features. They also put a comparison diagram exhibiting that Bluetooth
    and Wi-Fi were the best cost, and Bluetooth and ZigBee had the best power usage
    among the IoT communication technologies. The authors proposed case studies for
    forest fire detection and EEWS based on IoT devices. For the earthquake warning
    part, they mentioned the usage of Vibration Sensors (Accelerometer), PIC (Peripheral
    Device Controllers), ZigBee communication procedures, LCD monitors, and RS232
    cables. An IoT alarm message was sent to smartphones, and an alarm message via
    GSM standard was sent to other cell phones. Mishra et al. [193] have optimized
    a schedule for distributing relief items using IoT technologies, such as smart
    cities. There are some dynamic features dependent on the disaster conditions,
    such as changing relief demand and resource availability. IoT is suitable for
    such issues related to continuously flowing and dynamically changing data [194].
    The authors symbolized different time periods with sliding time windows in which
    the data update occurs. For the first window, relief distribution is decided according
    to the availability of vehicles, relief resources, priority of the disaster area,
    and delivery routes. The distribution schedule has been optimized repeatedly in
    the next time slots. The fragility of the problem that is being targeted, as well
    as its direct effect on human life, makes it imperative that a solution be found
    that is intelligent, trustworthy, and flexible despite the considerable efforts
    that have been put into developing the state-of-the-art. In this section, we throw
    light on the primary research explorations that have been done in this area. The
    primary efforts in developing IoT for the EEWS are outlined in detail in Table
    3. Table 3. IoT-based EEWS main efforts. In order to prevent the loss of human
    life, the implementation of an EEWS is an absolute necessity. In order to effectively
    manage disasters and reduce the danger of earthquakes, it is essential to have
    the ability to promptly detect the features of an earthquake. With technologies
    already in place, such as the IoT network, social media, global positioning system
    (GPS), and mobile nodes, these attributes can be sent to help mitigate the effects
    of a catastrophic earthquake. Figure 8 depicts a comprehensive EEWS with many
    administrations assisting in relieving the earthquake tragedy. The EEWS will include
    complete statistics regarding hospitals, railways, fire services, ambulances,
    airports, and so on based on these administrations. This proposed system does
    integrate social media, IoT technologies, cloud systems, and mobile systems. It
    operates in two stages. The first stage is pre-disaster, as ML models are used
    to detect the commencement of the principal wave. This procedure is extremely
    advantageous for risk minimization, such as rapid shutting down of nuclear power
    plants, electrical producers, and so on. The second phase begins after the disaster
    has occurred, with the goal of mitigating/reducing the disaster’s impacts. Using
    an integrated system, for example, allows for more accurate statistics regarding
    the affected people, buildings, utilities, and areas. As a result, an effective
    evacuation strategy can be implemented. Figure 8. A general architecture of EWS.
    A solution that is both flexible and intelligent and that is able to deal with
    complex problems in a relatively short amount of time is required for such a system.
    ML has the potential to play a significant and critical part in the administrations
    that are interconnected and working on achieving successful EWS among the variety
    of existing current techniques. ML is a promising method that works regardless
    of the data type, format, length, and other factors such as these. Indeed, real-time
    monitoring takes place across all of the dispersed organizations shown in Figure
    8, which serves as the foundation for a reliable EEWS. As a consequence of this,
    the transfer of data between various entities needs to be thoroughly investigated
    and estimated. After that, ML models are utilized to zero in on the current status
    of each object and even provide an estimate for a certain word. As a consequence
    of this, those institutions are capable of making useful contributions prior to,
    during, and after earthquake disasters. To put it another way, a technique such
    as this can assist with the management of earthquake catastrophes, the reduction
    of earthquake risks, and evacuation tactics. As a consequence of this, the performance
    of the EEWS improves in direct proportion to the quality of the ML model. Figure
    9 provides a visual representation of the interaction between trains as a specific
    administration used in the process of full EEWS, the data processing, and the
    research done. To be more precise, earthquake data is monitored to be sent for
    processing using the IoT network in order to carry out the desired check and determine
    the correct decision to send to the railway system for suitable action using an
    ML model and the railway information of the disaster location. This process is
    repeated until the appropriate decision is made. Figure 9. A pattern of Iot-based
    EEWS. The authors of [197] mentioned the same approach of benefiting from UAVs
    as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) to provide connectivity instead of traditional
    base stations. They proposed two trajectory planning algorithms using a k-value
    selection method and K-means centroids for UAVs. These UAVs served to the clusters
    of user equipment. By enhancing the study, the authors also gave two methods for
    cluster head selection to support continuous connectivity via UAVs and cluster
    heads. The authors of [198] suggested a system to find the damage degrees of various
    earthquake region parts such as roads and riverways. They used single-rotor and
    six-rotor UAVs and took visible light images of the region parts. Once the image
    quality evaluation was done according to the image contrast, the image blur, and
    the image noise formulas, the aerial images were analyzed with Gray Level Cooccurrence
    Matrix, the Tamura, and the Gabor wavelet features. Lastly, the SVM classifier
    was used to obtain the damage levels. The authors of [199] proposed to use UAVs
    for monitoring earthquake impacts after the disaster occurrence. The damage to
    the buildings was derived with the help of one fixed-wing UAV and two multirotor
    UAVs. The aerial mapping gathered from the UAVs was compared with a physical field
    survey. The buildings’ structural properties were extracted from the damages on
    different parts of the surfaces, such as walls, roofs, and perimeter columns.
    Additionally, the liquefaction situation was seen from the area investigation
    that also presented the damage levels of the settlements. Overall, the use of
    drones in earthquake disaster detection and management has the potential to save
    lives, speed up response times, and improve the efficiency of emergency services.
    As technology continues to advance, it is likely that drones will become an even
    more important tool in disaster management, helping to mitigate the effects of
    earthquakes and other natural disasters. Figure 10 shows the role of UAVs for
    three scenarios of pre, during, and post-disaster situations. Figure 10. Three
    scenarios of disaster and the role of UAV. Evaluating the performance and reliability
    of IoT-enabled earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) is crucial for ensuring
    their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. There are several techniques that
    can be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance and reliability
    of these systems, including simulation testing, field testing, and data-driven
    analysis: Simulation testing involves creating a virtual environment that simulates
    real-world conditions, including seismic activity and sensor data [200,201]. Simulation
    testing allows researchers to test the performance of an EEWS system under different
    scenarios, such as different magnitudes and distances of earthquakes and different
    types of seismic waves [202]. This technique can also be used to evaluate the
    effectiveness of different algorithms and parameters used in the system [203].
    Field testing involves deploying an EEWS system in real-world conditions and collecting
    data on its performance and reliability [204,205]. Field testing can provide valuable
    insights into the system’s performance under actual operating conditions, which
    may differ from those in a simulated environment. Field testing can also help
    to identify potential issues with the system, such as sensor malfunction or communication
    failures [206]. This technique can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, but
    it provides valuable data on the system’s performance and reliability in real-world
    scenarios [207]. Data-driven analysis involves analyzing large datasets generated
    by an EEWS system to identify patterns and trends, which can provide insights
    into its performance and reliability [208]. Data-driven analysis can be used to
    identify correlations between sensor data and earthquake characteristics, such
    as magnitude, duration, and intensity [209]. This technique can also be used to
    identify anomalies in sensor data, which may indicate issues with the system’s
    performance or reliability [210]. Data-driven analysis can provide valuable insights
    into the performance and reliability of an EEWS system over long periods of time
    [211]. By using a combination of these techniques, researchers can gain a more
    comprehensive understanding of the performance and reliability of IoT-enabled
    EEWS systems. This can help to identify areas for improvement and ultimately improve
    the effectiveness of these systems in mitigating the impact of earthquakes. Integrating
    advanced technologies such as ML algorithms, distributed computing, and edge computing
    into EEWS systems can improve their accuracy and effectiveness. However, there
    are several challenges and considerations associated with these technologies.
    For example, ML algorithms require large amounts of data and computational resources
    to train and optimize, which may be difficult to obtain in the context of EEWS
    systems [212,213]. Distributed computing can improve the scalability and fault
    tolerance of EEWS systems, but it also introduces additional complexity and overhead
    in terms of communication and coordination [214,215,216,217]. Edge computing can
    improve the responsiveness and efficiency of EEWS systems by processing data closer
    to the source. Still, it also requires careful management of resources and trade-offs
    between processing power and energy consumption [218,219]. In addition, the implementation
    of these advanced technologies can be complex and may require significant expertise
    and resources. Furthermore, there may be limitations associated with the hardware
    and software infrastructure of EEWS systems, such as sensor networks and communication
    protocols, which may need to be upgraded or modified to support these technologies.
    Therefore, while integrating advanced technologies into EEWS systems has the potential
    to improve their accuracy and effectiveness, careful consideration of the trade-offs
    and implementation complexities is necessary to ensure their successful deployment
    and operation. 5. Validation and Verification Aspects Validation and verification
    (V&V) are essential for ensuring the quality, reliability, optimization, and safety
    of systems and products [220,221,222]. They involve rigorous evaluation against
    requirements and standards, identifying and correcting defects, improving performance,
    and ensuring compliance. In the context of IoT systems, V&V is crucial for addressing
    complex behaviors, identifying vulnerabilities, and complying with regulations
    [223,224]. For cloud systems, V&V ensures dependability, security, performance
    optimization, and adherence to standards [225,226,227]. Overall, V&V is vital
    for constructing trustworthy, resilient, compliant systems that meet user and
    societal expectations [228]. 5.1. Different Categories of V&V Techniques There
    are several types of validation and verification techniques that can be applied
    to these systems [229,230] (Figure 11). One common technique is functional testing,
    which involves testing the system’s functions to ensure that they perform as expected
    [231]. This testing can be done manually or through automated testing tools. Another
    technique is performance testing, which involves testing the system’s ability
    to handle a certain level of workload or traffic [232]. This can include stress
    testing, load testing, and capacity testing [233,234]. Figure 11. Different Categories
    of V&V Techniques. Security testing is another important technique for IoT and
    cloud systems [235,236,237]. This involves testing the system’s security features
    and protocols to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that sensitive information
    is protected [238,239,240]. Penetration testing is a type of security testing
    that involves attempting to hack into the system to identify weaknesses and potential
    security breaches [241,242,243]. Usability testing is also important for these
    systems, as they must be user-friendly and easy to navigate [244]. This testing
    involves gathering feedback from users to identify areas of the system that can
    be improved to enhance the user experience [245]. Regression testing is another
    important technique for IoT and cloud systems [246,247]. It involves retesting
    the system after making changes or updates to ensure that the changes have not
    introduced new defects or issues in previously tested areas [248]. Regression
    testing can be done manually or through automated testing tools, and it is important
    to perform regularly to ensure that the system remains stable and reliable throughout
    its lifecycle [249,250]. By conducting thorough regression testing, developers
    can identify and fix issues early on, ultimately leading to a more robust and
    reliable system for users [251]. Formal methods (Figure 12) are another important
    set of techniques that can be used for validation and verification of IoT and
    cloud systems [252,253]. Formal methods involve the use of mathematical models
    and logic to verify the correctness and reliability of a system [254]. This technique
    can be used to check the consistency of the system design and its specifications,
    as well as to identify potential errors and defects in the system [255,256]. Formal
    methods can also be used to ensure that the system meets certain performance and
    safety requirements [257,258,259]. While formal methods can be more time-consuming
    and complex than other validation and verification techniques, they can provide
    a high level of confidence in the correctness and reliability of the system [260,261,262].
    Therefore, formal methods are an important tool for developers to consider when
    designing and testing IoT and cloud systems. Figure 12. A simplified illustration
    of how Formals Methods work [263]. In addition to these techniques, there are
    also validation and verification techniques specific to cloud systems. For example,
    validation techniques for cloud systems may include compliance testing to ensure
    that the system complies with industry standards and regulations and testing the
    system’s ability to handle real-time data processing and communication. Overall,
    validation and verification techniques are critical for ensuring the reliability,
    security, and efficiency of IoT and cloud systems. By applying these techniques,
    developers can identify and address issues early in the development process, ultimately
    leading to better-performing and more secure systems for users. 5.2. Adaptation
    of V&V Techniques for EEWS Verification and validation (V&V) techniques are crucial
    for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of earthquake detection and warning
    systems in the context of IoT. These systems use a combination of sensors, data
    analysis algorithms, and communication technologies to detect and respond to earthquakes
    in real time. However, the adaptation of V&V techniques for these systems presents
    unique challenges and opportunities. One challenge is the need for a robust and
    reliable sensor network. EEWS relies on a sensor network to detect and measure
    seismic activity. These sensors must be calibrated and tested regularly to ensure
    that they are functioning correctly. V&V techniques can help to ensure that the
    sensor network is reliable and accurate by providing a framework for testing and
    calibration. More precisely, to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the entire
    sensor network, a statistical calibration and testing approach can be employed.
    This involves validating a representative sample of sensors rather than individually
    testing each sensor, given the large number of sensors typically used. Statistically,
    the majority of sensors will be sufficiently calibrated and functioning properly
    at the time of an earthquake. Another challenge is the desirability of real-time
    data analysis and action plans. In earthquake detection systems, timely and accurate
    decision-making is critical for minimizing damage and saving lives. V&V techniques
    can help to ensure that the data analysis algorithms used in these systems are
    accurate and reliable. This can involve testing the algorithms under a variety
    of conditions and scenarios, as well as ensuring that they are able to operate
    in real time. In addition to challenges, there are also opportunities for the
    adaptation of V&V techniques for IoT earthquake systems. One opportunity is the
    use of simulation and modeling. V&V techniques can be used to create simulations
    and models of earthquake scenarios to test and validate the performance of the
    detection and warning systems. This can help to identify potential weaknesses
    in the system and inform improvements. Another opportunity is the use of crowdsourcing
    and citizen science. V&V techniques can be used to validate and integrate data
    from citizen scientists and volunteers who contribute to earthquake detection
    and warning systems. This can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of
    the system while also engaging the public in the process. In conclusion, the adaptation
    of V&V techniques for IoT earthquake systems presents both challenges and opportunities.
    By leveraging V&V techniques, developers can ensure that these systems are reliable,
    accurate, and effective in detecting and responding to seismic activity. This
    can help to minimize damage and save lives in the event of an earthquake. 5.3.
    Cost and Limitations of V&V Techniques Verification and validation (V&V) techniques
    are crucial in ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems for IoT
    and cloud computing systems. However, these systems come with unique challenges
    and limitations that must be considered when implementing V&V techniques. One
    cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the sheer scale of these systems.
    These systems can involve thousands or even millions of interconnected devices,
    making it difficult to perform comprehensive testing and validation. Additionally,
    the heterogeneity of these systems, with devices from different manufacturers
    and with different capabilities, can complicate the verification and validation
    process. Another cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the need
    for specialized testing environments and tools. These systems require highly specialized
    tools and environments for testing and validation, such as simulators, emulators,
    and testbeds. These tools can be expensive to implement and maintain and may require
    highly skilled personnel to operate effectively. Furthermore, there are limitations
    to the effectiveness of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems. One limitation
    is the difficulty of testing for security and privacy vulnerabilities. These systems
    often involve sensitive data and critical infrastructure, making security and
    privacy a top priority. However, it is challenging to test for all possible security
    and privacy vulnerabilities, especially as new threats emerge constantly. Another
    limitation is the challenge of testing for real-time and low-latency requirements.
    IoT and cloud systems often require real-time performance and low-latency communication,
    which can be difficult to test and validate. These systems may involve complex
    interactions between devices and services, making it challenging to ensure that
    they meet these requirements. In conclusion, V&V techniques are crucial for ensuring
    the quality and reliability of software systems for IoT and cloud computing systems.
    However, these systems have unique challenges and limitations that must be considered
    when implementing V&V techniques. By understanding these costs and limitations,
    software developers can implement V&V techniques more effectively and efficiently,
    ultimately leading to higher-quality software systems. 6. Open Challenges, Conclusions
    and Future Directions The use of IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents significant
    opportunities for improving the speed and accuracy of earthquake detection and
    response. However, there are also several challenges that must be addressed to
    ensure the reliability and effectiveness of these systems (Figure 13). Figure
    13. Open Challenges. Sensor network reliability and accuracy: One of the primary
    challenges in implementing IoT and cloud-based EEWS is ensuring the reliability
    and accuracy of the sensor network. These systems rely on a network of sensors
    to detect and measure seismic activity, making it essential to ensure that the
    sensors are functioning correctly. Real-time data processing and decision-making:
    EEWS require fast and accurate data processing and decision-making capabilities
    to provide timely alerts to people and organizations in affected areas. This requires
    sophisticated algorithms and real-time data processing capabilities, which can
    be challenging to implement in IoT and cloud-based systems. Secure communication
    channels: The transmission of data between sensors, cloud facilities, and other
    components in an EEWS must be secure to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
    Ensuring the security of communication channels is a significant challenge in
    designing and implementing these systems. Heterogeneity and scalability: IoT and
    cloud-based systems are inherently heterogeneous, with devices and services from
    different manufacturers and with different capabilities. Ensuring seamless integration
    and scalability of these systems is a significant challenge, particularly as the
    number of devices and sensors in the network increases. Cost-effectiveness and
    sustainability: Implementing an EEWS using IoT and cloud facilities can be costly,
    requiring significant investment in hardware, software, and personnel. Ensuring
    the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of these systems is a significant challenge,
    particularly in regions with limited resources. Usability and accessibility: EEWS
    must be usable and accessible to people and organizations in affected areas, including
    those with limited literacy or technical skills. Ensuring the usability and accessibility
    of these systems is a significant challenge, requiring careful consideration of
    user needs and preferences. Privacy and ethical concerns: The collection and processing
    of data in EEWS raise privacy and ethical concerns, particularly as these systems
    become more sophisticated and widespread. Ensuring that these systems comply with
    relevant regulations and ethical principles is a significant challenge. Interference
    from environmental factors: EEWS can be affected by environmental factors such
    as electromagnetic noise and weather conditions, which can interfere with the
    accuracy and reliability of the sensor network. Ensuring the robustness and resilience
    of these systems is a significant challenge, requiring careful consideration of
    environmental factors. Continuous monitoring and maintenance: IoT and cloud-based
    EEWS require continuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure system performance
    and reliability. Ensuring the continuous monitoring and maintenance of these systems
    is a significant challenge, requiring robust and scalable infrastructure and skilled
    personnel. The use of IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents a significant
    opportunity for improving the speed and accuracy of earthquake detection and response.
    However, addressing the challenges outlined above is essential to ensure the reliability
    and sustainability of these systems in the long term. This survey has highlighted
    the potential benefits of using IoT and cloud technologies in EEWS, including
    real-time data analysis, improved sensor networks, and faster decision-making.
    However, the survey has also identified several challenges that must be addressed,
    such as the need for reliable and accurate sensor networks, real-time data processing,
    and secure communication channels. Overall, the survey underscores the importance
    of continued research and development in this area, as well as the need for rigorous
    verification and validation techniques to ensure the reliability and effectiveness
    of these systems. Below, we propose some interesting future directions: Development
    of more efficient and accurate sensors: Research and development should focus
    on developing more efficient and accurate sensors that can accurately detect and
    measure seismic activity while also being cost-effective and scalable. Integration
    of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML: The integration of AI and ML can help
    to improve the accuracy and reliability of data analysis algorithms used in EEWS.
    This can lead to faster and more accurate decision-making, improving the effectiveness
    of these systems [264,265]. Standardization of communication protocols: The standardization
    of communication protocols can help to ensure the interoperability and scalability
    of IoT and cloud-based EEWS. This can simplify the integration of different devices
    and services, reducing the complexity of these systems. Adoption of free, open-source
    software: The adoption of free, open-source software can help to reduce the cost
    and complexity of developing EEWS while also encouraging collaboration and innovation
    in this area. Engagement with local communities: Engagement with local communities
    can help to ensure that EEWS are developed in a form that meets the needs and
    preferences of people and organizations in affected areas. This can improve the
    usability and effectiveness of these systems in real-world scenarios. Development
    of new funding models: The development of new funding models, such as public–private
    partnerships, can help to ensure the sustainability and scalability of EEWS. This
    can provide the necessary resources and expertise to develop and maintain these
    systems over the long term. The “last kilometer” problem: This problem is the
    difficulty of assuring prompt and efficient warning, communication, and reaction
    systems to people and communities in the final seconds before the occurrence of
    powerful and devastating S-wave shaking during an earthquake. In particular, it
    requires addressing densely populated areas where the window for preparation and
    evacuation is constrained, where there is a gap between earthquake EEWS and the
    capacity to reach and notify individuals in the impacted area. In order to protect
    people’s safety and well-being in the final crucial seconds before the arrival
    of the destructive seismic waves, this topic focuses on the necessity for the
    effective broadcast of alerts and emergency instructions. In conclusion, continued
    research and development, as well as collaboration and innovation, will be essential
    in addressing the challenges and realizing the potential benefits of using IoT
    and cloud facilities for EEWS. By addressing these challenges and implementing
    future directions, it is possible to develop more reliable, accurate, and effective
    EEWS that can save lives and minimize damage in the event of seismic activity.

    networks (CR-WSNs) are a type of WSNs that use cognitive radio technology to enhance
    the spectrum utilization and energy efficiency. This paper proposes an energy-efficient
    resource allocation algorithm (EERAA) to prolong the lifetime of a WSN-based smart
    irrigation system under realistic scenarios. In the proposed algorithm, power
    allocation and subcarrier assignment are performed consecutively. Considering
    the impact of the intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by timing offset, the
    problem of maximizing network-averaged capacity is formulated considering power
    and interference constraints in realistic scenarios. The obtained results reveal
    that the proposed algorithm attempts to maximize the averaged capacity of the
    CR-WSN subject to the total power constraint and tolerable interference. Numerically,
    the proposed algorithm can reduce the network energy consumption by up to 30%,
    compared with conventional approaches, while maintaining a high level of system
    performance in terms of secondary users’ (SUs) averaged capacity. Keywords: smart

    approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimize water usage in agricultural
    practices. With the increasing global demand for food production and the growing
    scarcity of water resources, efficient irrigation techniques are crucial for sustainable
    agriculture. Smart irrigation systems integrate various components, such as sensors,
    actuators, and data analytics, to enable precise monitoring and control of irrigation
    processes. These systems utilize a network of sensors to collect real-time data
    on environmental factors, soil moisture levels, and plant conditions [1]. The
    collected data are then analyzed and processed using sophisticated algorithms
    to determine the optimal amount and timing of water application. By considering
    factors such as weather conditions, crop requirements, and soil characteristics,
    smart irrigation systems can provide precise and targeted irrigation, minimizing
    water waste and maximizing crop yield [2,3]. One key advantage of smart irrigation
    is its ability to enable remote monitoring and control. Farmers can access the
    system through web-based platforms or mobile applications, allowing them to monitor
    field conditions and adjust irrigation schedules from anywhere at any time. This
    remote accessibility enhances operational efficiency and reduces the need for
    manual labor, saving time and resources. Moreover, smart irrigation systems can
    be integrated with weather forecasting systems to further enhance their effectiveness.
    By incorporating real-time weather data, these systems can adapt irrigation schedules
    based on predicted rainfall or temperature changes, ensuring optimal water usage
    and reducing reliance on manual adjustments. The benefits of smart irrigation
    extend beyond water conservation and crop productivity. By minimizing water usage,
    farmers can reduce their overall operational costs, improve energy efficiency,
    and mitigate environmental impacts, such as water pollution and soil erosion [1].
    A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a network of many low-cost and power-limited
    sensors that are distributed in an area to monitor and collect data about the
    physical or environmental conditions. The sensors are outfitted with a diverse
    array of monitoring capabilities, including temperature, humidity, pressure, light,
    sound, and motion. They establish wireless communication among themselves to establish
    a network. The collected data can then be processed, analyzed, and transmitted
    to a central control unit or a remote server for further processing and storage.
    The primary advantage of WSNs is their ability to provide a real-time, continuous,
    and fine-grained monitoring of the physical world, which can be used in many applications,
    such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, healthcare, industrial automation,
    and precision agriculture [4,5,6,7]. However, the design and deployment of WSNs
    pose several challenges, such as limited power, bandwidth, processing capabilities,
    communication and network management issues, security and privacy concerns, and
    the need for robust and energy-efficient algorithms and protocols. Nevertheless,
    the widespread use of WSNs is expected to grow in the future as the Internet of
    Things (IoT) continues to expand, providing new opportunities for innovation and
    improving the quality of life. Recently, several studies related to these challenges
    have been conducted [7,8]. Cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CR-WSNs)
    are a type of WSNs that use CR technology to enhance the spectrum utilization
    and power conservation [9,10,11]. In CR-WSNs, the sensor nodes are equipped with
    cognitive radios that can sense the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and adapt the
    transmission parameters to avoid interference and optimize energy consumption.
    This allows CR-WSNs to operate in a dynamic and heterogeneous RF environment,
    where different types of wireless devices coexist and compete for limited spectrum
    resources. By using cognitive radio technology, CR-WSNs can achieve higher spectrum
    efficiency, better reliability, and longer network lifetime compared with traditional
    WSNs. CR-WSNs have various applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart
    irrigation, industrial control, healthcare, and smart cities, where reliable and
    energy-efficient wireless communication is critical [12,13,14]. In practical scenarios
    of CR networks, the estimation algorithm design can be affected by channel sensing
    uncertainty resulting from false alarms and misdetections. As a result, it is
    of interest to identify how estimation algorithm quality is affected by channel
    sensing errors. As such, this paper aims to investigate the impact of imperfect
    sensing on the performance of CR-WSNs. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (OFDM) [15] is widely regarded as a top contender for the physical layer of CR
    systems due to its flexible, reconfigurable subcarrier structure that enables
    easy adaptation and adjustment of system parameters. OFDM is also capable of avoiding
    interference through the addition of the cyclic prefix, and it offers large bandwidth
    efficiency through orthogonality, resilience to frequency-selective fading channels,
    and simplified equalizer design. However, OFDM is very sensitive to timing discrepancies
    due to synchronization error. The shortage of OFDM comes from high side lobes
    in filters’ frequency response, which, in turn, lead to high interference between
    subcarriers, which is a major source that declines the performance of wireless
    communication systems [16,17,18]. In the current literature, optimizing the radio
    resources under power and interference constraints in the CR system remains an
    area of ongoing research. This paper seeks to enhance the SU’s average capacity
    with the consideration of quality of service (QoS) of the primary users (PUs).
    Hence, it is necessary to consider the interference produced by side lobes between
    primary users and secondary users. Additionally, the transmit power of each SU
    subcarrier can be adapted with the best possible resource allocation algorithm
    in order to not affect the PU while transmitting information. Unfortunately, there
    are few studies that have focused on this problem. Therefore, in this paper, the
    trade-off of increasing transmission capacity while maintaining an acceptable
    interference will be investigated. Resource allocation is a critical process that
    involves distributing resources, such as time, energy, bandwidth, and computational
    power, among competing demands. Efficient resource allocation is essential in
    various fields, including communication systems, transportation networks, manufacturing
    processes, and energy management [12,13]. Concerning WSNs, resource allocation
    is especially crucial since the resources available are typically limited, and
    the sensors’ energy consumption must be optimized to prolong the network’s lifespan.
    Proper resource allocation can lead to several benefits, such as improved system
    performance, reduced energy consumption, increased reliability, and enhanced scalability.
    Furthermore, resource allocation can help to ensure that critical tasks receive
    adequate resources, prevent network congestion, and reduce the risk of system
    failure. In summary, resource allocation is vital for optimizing the use of resources,
    achieving efficient operations, and achieving the desired system performance in
    various applications [19,20]. The resource allocation algorithm will take place
    after the SUs are allocated to the detected spectrum opportunities. Based on convex
    optimization techniques, we derive the resource allocation algorithm for the SU
    to achieve the highest capacity considering the interference constraint, along
    with the peak/average transmit power constraint of the SU. In summary, this work
    introduces the following contributions: (1) We present a practical scenario for
    CR-WSNs; then we investigate how imperfect channel sensing impacts the performance
    of CR-WSN-based systems. (2) We propose a resource allocation algorithm that aims
    to enhance the SU average capacity while ensuring that the interference level
    at the PU is below an acceptable level considering power constraint and ICI constraint.
    (3) To solve the above nonconvex optimization problem, the proposed algorithm
    is presented to search for the optimal transmit power of the SU. The detailed
    abbreviations and definitions used in this paper are listed in Table 1. Table
    1. List of abbreviations. The rest of the paper is presented according to the
    following sequence: The related work is presented in Section 2. The system model
    of CR-WSNs and presented channel sensing model are illustrated in Section 3. The
    proposed resource allocation and problem formulation are presented in Section
    4. Section 5 provides the simulation results and discussion. Finally, Section
    6 presents the conclusions. 2. Related Work In [12], the authors presented a resource
    allocation scheme that utilizes a Stackelberg game approach to optimize the SUs’
    throughput while satisfying the PU’s interference constraint in a multiuser CR
    network. The authors in [13] proposed a resource allocation scheme for CR-WSNs
    that incorporates energy harvesting capabilities. The authors consider a CR-WSN
    with a single CR node and multiple energy harvesting nodes, and they express the
    resource allocation formula as an optimization problem that maximizes the network
    throughput subject to energy neutrality constraints for the energy harvesting
    nodes and interference constraints for the PUs. In [21], the authors proposed
    an effective resource allocation technique, namely, the Improved Pliable Cognitive
    Medium Access Protocol, designed to address the challenges of multilevel heterogeneity
    in CR-WSN. In [22], a computationally efficient resource allocation algorithm
    in a multi-carrier-based CR network is presented to maximize the system capacity.
    The assumption made in this work is to neglect the interference from PU to SU.
    The authors in [23] proposed a trajectory design and resource allocation scheme
    to maximize the achievable rate of an SU in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) CR
    system. They optimized the UAV trajectory, transmit power to satisfy practical
    constraints, and an interference temperature threshold. The work in [24] focuses
    on the achievable rate analysis and resource allocation of the cognitive low earth
    orbit (LEO) satellite system. Specifically, a joint power allocation scheme was
    proposed to maximize the sum rate of the IoT transmission subject to performance
    requirements and constraints of the legacy satellite system. The quasi-concave
    nature of the sum rate of the IoT users over the satellite terminal receive power
    was proved, which allows for optimal receive powers to be derived. An energy-efficient
    resource allocation approach in secure CR networks was presented in [25]. The
    paper introduces an ergodic secure energy efficiency problem for a CR network
    with a PU, an SU, and an eavesdropper, and presents a convex optimization problem
    for power allocation using fractional programming and dual decomposition techniques.
    The proposed approach aims to maximize the ergodic secure energy efficiency of
    the SU with constraints on the average interference power and average transmit
    power. In [26], the authors propose a resource allocation algorithm to improve
    the sum rate considering power and interference constraints using a Rayleigh fading
    channel. However, the scenario where the SUs communicate while facing channel
    sensing uncertainty has not been considered in any of these works. Therefore,
    we propose an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm (EERAA) to enhance
    the average capacity and prolong the lifetime of a WSN-based smart irrigation
    system under realistic scenarios. In the proposed algorithm, power allocation
    and subcarrier assignment are performed sequentially. Our approach differs from
    that in [26] by considering the capacity reduction on all subcarriers occupied
    by a PU, rather than just on the first adjacent subcarrier to the SU. Furthermore,
    we employ a coarse approximation of the channel’s gain for the SU. The obtained
    results illustrate that the average capacity of SUs is close to that of the perfect
    channel knowledge scenario. 3. CR-WSN System Model A WSN-based smart irrigation
    system is a modern and innovative solution for efficient and sustainable agriculture.
    The system comprises a network of sensors that are deployed in the soil, plants,
    and environment to monitor and collect data related to soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, rainfall, and other relevant parameters. These data are then transmitted
    wirelessly to a central control unit that processes the data and triggers the
    irrigation system based on predefined thresholds and algorithms. The WSN-based
    smart irrigation system enables farmers to optimize water usage, increase crop
    yields, reduce water wastage, and lower energy costs. Additionally, it is easily
    expandable and can be adapted to achieve the specific requirements of various
    crops and farming practices. With the rise of climate change and water scarcity
    issues, WSN-based smart irrigation systems are becoming increasingly popular and
    essential for modern agriculture. The CR-WSN-based smart irrigation system model
    is illustrated in Figure 1 with an N cluster each with one cluster head (CH) and
    many sensor nodes spread over an area with size A. The transmission between the
    sensor nodes and the CH within the cluster is carried out using the unlicensed
    spectrum, while the transmission between the CH and the sink node takes place
    opportunistically through the licensed spectrum. The licensed spectrum that is
    being targeted includes M radio channels that exhibit varying PU communications
    and signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) [27]. Figure 1. CR-WSN-based smart irrigation
    system model. Channel Sensing The first step involves using CH nodes (i.e., SUs)
    to sense the transmission channel, to decide whether it is currently available
    or busy by a PU. Energy detection methods are commonly used for this purpose,
    especially when the transmission modes of PUs are unknown. Assuming that 𝑦 𝑙 represents
    the PU’s signal at a specific location, and 𝑛 𝑙 represents Gaussian white noise
    with a mean of zero and a variance of 𝜎 2 𝑛 for all 𝑙 , the CH’s measurement can
    be denoted as 𝐸 𝑙 . For each CH, a spectrum sensing function is defined by establishing
    two hypotheses according to the measurement. In this mathematical expression,
    the hypothesis checking for the channel sensing problem is performed over M symbol
    periods and can be expressed as follows [9]: 𝐻 0 : 𝐸 𝑙 = 𝑛 𝑙 𝑙=1,2,3…..𝑀 (1) 𝐻
    1 : 𝐸 𝑙 = 𝑦 𝑙 +𝑛 𝑙 𝑙=1,2,3…..𝑀 (2) In Equation (1), 𝐻 0 means that the PU signal
    is absent, while in Equation (2), 𝐻 1 means that the PU is present and using the
    channel. The M received signal sample points are gathered by cognitive nodes (CH),
    allowing for the detection statistics for energy detection to be expressed in
    the following manner: 𝐸= 1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑙=1 𝑀 | 𝑧 𝑙 | 2 (3) If we assume that | 𝐸 𝑙 | 2
    with 𝑙=1,…..,𝑀 is composed of independently and identically distributed random
    variables, to verify the mean E for large values of M, we can use the central
    limit theorem. This is demonstrated in [26] as: 𝔼{𝑍}={ 𝜎 2 𝑛 ,    𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟  𝐻 0 𝜎
    2 𝑠 + 𝜎 2 𝑛 ,  𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟  𝐻 1 (4) where 𝜎 2 𝑠 represents the PU’s signal variance.
    It should be emphasized that the reliability of spectrum sensing is evaluated
    using two metrics: the first metric is the probability of detection 𝑃 𝑑 , which
    refers to the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when the spectrum
    is actually used by the PU. The second metric is the false alarm probability 𝑃
    𝑓 , which represents the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when
    the channel is free [9]. For instance, if 𝐻 0 is the true hypothesis, then P{
    𝐻 1 ̂ | 𝐻 0 } indicates the probability of a false alarm. 4. The Proposed Resource
    Allocation Concerning CR-WSNs, our attention is directed to both energy consumption
    and SU average capacity, which depends on its resource allocation scenario done
    by CH nodes. This paper proposes a resource allocation algorithm that maximizes
    the average capacity, taking into account both power constraint and interference
    constraint [28]. Therefore, the energy consumption and ICI optimization are strongly
    interconnected with each other in this case, making it difficult to solve it in
    general. To solve this issue, the successive convex optimization technique presented
    in [29] is applied. We consider CR-WSNs with spectrum sharing between PUs and
    SUs as illustrated in Figure 2, with the allocation of the PU (labelled “1”) and
    spectrum holes (denoted by “0”) with cluster number 𝑁 𝑐 =48 and 𝐹 𝑈 = 18 subcarriers
    in each hole. We have utilized the unambiguous interference formulas of OFDM,
    which previously obtained in [30] and selected the cluster number and size based
    on the realistic values of WiMAX 802.16. Figure 2. Allocation of primary users
    and available subcarriers considering 18 subcarriers allocated to each free sub-band.
    One or more interferences can exist within a single spectrum hole, as illustrated
    in Figure 2, where PUs and SUs utilize neighboring frequency bands. We assume
    that the ICI exists from the PU to the CH due to frequency offset. Based on the
    OFDM ICI tables obtained in [31], it was observed that “8” subcarriers (OFDM)
    induce the ICI to the channel. In cases where a sequence of intricate symbols
    is transmitted, the interference caused by a single subcarrier is the total of
    interference across all the time slots. For the subsequent analysis, we define
    the eight-element interference vectors of OFDM as designed in [32]. 𝑉 𝑜𝑓𝑑𝑚 = 10
    −2 ×[8.94,2.23,0.995,0.560,0.359,0.250,0.184,0.112] (5) One formulation of the
    problem faced by the SU is to enhance the sum data rate through power allocation
    in the detected spectrum holes: max 𝑃 :𝐶(𝑃)= ∑ 𝑢=1 𝑈 ∑ 𝑓=1 𝐹 𝑈 𝑙𝑜𝑔 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 1+
    𝑝 𝑢𝑓 𝑠 𝐺 𝑢𝑓 𝑠𝑠 𝜎 2 𝑛 + 𝐼 𝑢 𝑓 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ (6) s.t. ∑ 𝑢=1 𝑈 ∑ 𝑓=1 𝐹 𝑈 𝑝 𝑢𝑓 𝑠 ≤ 𝑝 𝑡ℎ

    𝐼 𝑡ℎ (9) In Equation (9), 𝑈 represents the number of spectrum holes, while 𝐹 𝑈
    , 𝑝 𝑢𝑓 𝑠 , 𝐺 𝑢𝑓 𝑠𝑠 , and 𝐼 𝑢 𝑓 denote the subcarrier number, SU power, CIR gain
    from the SU to its base station, and ICI from the PU to the SU on the 𝑓 𝑡ℎ subcarrier
    in the 𝑢 𝑡ℎ spectrum hole, respectively. The variables 𝑝 𝑡ℎ and 𝑝 𝑠𝑢𝑏 are the
    extreme user power boundary and power limit per subcarrier, respectively. The
    interference vector 𝑉 length is represented by 𝑁 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑢𝑙(𝑟) 𝑠 is the SU’s power
    on the right (left) 𝑛 𝑡ℎ subcarrier in the 𝑢 𝑡ℎ spectrum hole, 𝐺 𝑢𝑓 𝑠𝑝 is the
    gain of the propagation channel from the CH to the primary system on the right
    (left) PU’s subcarriers neighboring the 𝑢 𝑡ℎ spectrum hole, and 𝐼 𝑡ℎ represents
    the interference threshold. The last constraint is to protect the PU transmission,
    which needs that the received interference power at the PU due to the CH transmission
    is below a prescribed threshold. The interference from the primary system to the
    CH, 𝐼 𝑢 𝑓 , is written as in Equation (10): 𝐼 𝑢 𝑓 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨          
      ∑ 𝑛=𝑓 𝑁 𝑃 𝑢𝑙 𝑝 𝐺 𝑢𝑙 𝑝𝑠 𝑉 𝑛 𝑓=1,2,3….. 𝑁 𝑖 ∑ 𝑛= 𝐹 𝑈 −𝑓+1 𝑁 𝑃 𝑢𝑟 𝑝 𝐺 𝑢𝑟 𝑝𝑠 𝑉
    𝑛 𝑓= 𝐹 𝑈 − 𝑁 𝑖 +1,….. 𝐹 𝑈 0         𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (10) In Equation (10), 𝑃 𝑢𝑙(𝑟) 𝑝
    and 𝐺 𝑢𝑙(𝑟) 𝑝𝑠 represent the primary user transmitted power and channel gain existing
    at the right (left) of the 𝑢 𝑡ℎ spectrum hole to the SU on the 𝑓 𝑡ℎ subcarrier
    of the 𝑢 𝑡ℎ spectrum hole, respectively. Our optimization problem in (6) is formulated
    as a concave function, while the constraints in (7)–(9) are linear, making it
    a convex optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using several
    linear programming (LP) methods, such as the CVX-SDPT3 toolbox [28]. The algorithm’s
    details are summarized in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 The procedure of the CVX optimization
    algorithm 1: Input—Set the channel gains, the maximum user power 𝒑 𝒕𝒉 and power
    limits per subcarrier 𝒑 𝒔𝒖𝒃 , and the noise power. 2: Solve—Solve the optimization
    problem (6) for given constraints in (7)–(9). 3: Output—The optimum power for
    all subcarriers. 5. Simulation Results and Discussion The following section illustrates
    the obtained results that assess the performance of the EERAA algorithm in the
    presence of imperfect channel sensing. The probability of primary users’ presence
    is 0.25, i.e., P{𝐻 1 }=0.25 and P{𝐻 0 }=0.75 . The EERAA algorithm is validated
    through Monte Carlo simulations over a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel
    between the secondary transmitter and receiver. The simulations consider 256 subcarriers
    and QPSK modulation. Figure 3 presents the bit error rate (BER) performance of
    the proposed EERAA algorithm versus 𝐸 𝑏 / 𝑁 0 compared with the scenario of no
    sensing errors. The perfect estimation has the same performance as the case with
    no sensing errors, which indicate the validation of the proposed algorithm. The
    simulation also considers different levels of sensing errors. The results indicate
    that the BER performance degrades as the sensing errors increase. When the probability
    of detection 𝑃 𝑑 drops from 1 to 0, the BER performance is affected. Figure 3.
    The impact of sensing errors on BER of the proposed EERAA algorithm considering
    different scenarios of sensing errors. Figure 4 presents a BER performance comparison
    among the proposed EERAA algorithm, the joint resource allocation (JRA) [33],
    and resource allocation with sensing-based interference (RASI) [12] algorithms.
    It is clear that the EERAA algorithm gives the better performance compared with
    the other algorithms. Figure 4. BER comparison among the proposed EERAA, RASI
    [12], and JRA [33]. The following Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the performance
    evaluation of the proposed resource allocation algorithm based on the average
    spectral efficiency. Figure 5 depicts the scenario where an SU, utilizing F available
    subcarriers, is surrounded by subcarriers allocated to the PU, causing interference
    from both sides. In this case, the SU’s spectral efficiency values show an improvement
    compared with the initial allocation. The power allocation algorithm attempts
    to avoid subcarriers adjacent to the PU, leading to the localization of power
    allocation in the middle of the spectrum hole. Figure 5. Common channel scenarios
    in the case of a single user and F = 18. Figure 6. SU’s averaged capacity versus
    total power. Figure 6 demonstrates the impact of the maximum power levels. The
    graph in Figure 6 clearly shows that increasing the average power per subcarrier,
    denoted as P, results in higher spectral efficiencies (𝑃= 𝑝 𝑡ℎ /𝐹) . It is also
    clear that the performance of the proposed EERAA algorithm can be observed to
    approach that of the perfectly known channel scenario. Figure 7 illustrates the
    impact of the number of subcarriers on the SU’s averaged capacity. The performance
    of OFDM increases as the number of subcarriers increases. Additionally, it is
    worth noting that the performance of the proposed algorithm approximates the performance
    of the perfectly estimated case. Figure 7. SU’s averaged capacity versus number
    of subcarriers. Figure 8 illustrates energy consumption per node in terms of number
    of clusters and network size. It is evident from this figure that, as the number
    of clusters increases, the energy consumption decreases. It is also clear that
    the energy consumption of WSN with the proposed algorithm is approximately three
    times lower than the conventional WSN that does not use the proposed algorithm.
    Figure 8. Energy consumption versus number of clusters and network size. 6. Conclusions
    This paper presented an EERAA algorithm for CR-WSN-based smart irrigation systems.
    The proposed algorithm addresses the challenge of prolonging the WSN’s lifetime
    by reducing energy consumption while achieving high secondary users’ average capacity.
    The algorithm performs power allocation and subcarrier assignment sequentially
    and considers the effect of ICI. We formulated the maximization of system capacity
    under realistic scenarios with power and interference constraints. Simulation
    results indicate that the proposed EERAA algorithm outperforms the conventional
    approaches by reducing network energy consumption by up to 30% while maintaining
    high average capacity. The numerical analysis and simulation results confirm that
    EERAA can prolong the lifetime of WSN-based smart irrigation systems and enhance
    their energy efficiency. In conclusion, the proposed EERAA algorithm can effectively
    address the energy efficiency and spectrum utilization challenges in CR-WSN-based
    smart irrigation systems. This research provides a valuable contribution towards
    achieving sustainable agricultural practices by developing efficient resource
    allocation algorithms for smart irrigation systems. Future research can explore
    the implementation of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios and evaluate
    its performance in various wireless communication applications. Future research
    directions can further investigate the integration of advanced machine learning
    techniques into the proposed EERAA algorithm for CR-WSN-based smart irrigation
    systems. This can involve exploring the use of reinforcement learning or deep
    learning algorithms to enhance the adaptive and autonomous decision-making capabilities
    of the system. Additionally, the scalability and robustness of the algorithm can
    be studied in larger-scale deployments and under diverse environmental conditions.
    Furthermore, the investigation of novel sensor technologies and network architectures
    can also contribute to the advancement of CR-WSNs in smart agriculture. By addressing
    these research areas, we can pave the way for more efficient and sustainable agricultural
    practices while ensuring optimal resource utilization and environmental conservation.

    energy installations are becoming increasingly common in new city developments
    and renovations. With a broad range of technological applications and improvements
    in this field, the demand for suitable monitoring technologies and control processes
    for geothermal energy installations is also growing. This article identifies opportunities
    for the future development and deployment of IoT sensors applied to geothermal
    energy installations. The first part of the survey describes the technologies
    and applications of various sensor types. Sensors that monitor temperature, flow
    rate and other mechanical parameters are presented with a technological background

    monitoring, with a focus on IoT node designs, data transmission technologies and
    cloud services. Energy harvesting technologies and edge computing methods are
    also reviewed. The survey concludes with a discussion of research challenges and
    an outline of new areas of application for monitoring geothermal installations
    and innovating technologies to produce IoT sensor solutions. Keywords: geothermal
    energy; geothermal sensors; energy harvesting; edge computing; IoT 1. Introduction
    Geothermal energy is characterized by two types, one with high enthalpy and the
    other with low enthalpy. High-enthalpy energy is found in specific regions and
    rock masses that contain high temperatures and high heat potential, especially
    volcanic areas and deep faults. High-enthalpy energy is used for power and heat
    generation, while low-enthalpy energy is used only for heat generation and can
    be found in most shallow rock mass zones around the world. Underground geothermal
    structures have been used for various applications, for example, electricity production
    or district heating. Heat pumps for geothermal applications and geothermal plants
    produce both electricity and hot water for district heating. To provide the data
    required for the proper functioning and control of systems, it is necessary to
    monitor various parameters within specific volumes of rock [1]. Monitoring the
    conditions of the rock environment provides the information required to manage
    and control processes to prolong the lifetimes of systems and avoid outages in
    operating underground geothermal structures [2]. To control a geothermal system,
    the key monitoring parameters are the fluid temperature, ambient rock environment
    temperature, volumetric flow rate, and physical characteristics of underground
    structures; minor monitoring parameters include scale formation [3] and slope
    movement [4]. Monitoring the specific characteristics and behaviors of underground
    structures assists in detecting problems and failures that prevent optimal system
    operation and energy management. The monitoring focus for an underground geothermal
    structure is dependent on the geothermal application area, examples of which include
    heat pumps [5], mines or wells [6], pipelines [7], reservoirs [8] and borehole
    exchangers [9]. Monitoring aims to determine or continuously update the status
    of key parameters necessary for the proper operation of an underground geothermal
    structure. To monitor these parameters, devices such as those connected to the
    Internet of Things (IoT) can be used. These devices must be able to monitor several
    variables and wirelessly transmit measured values to the cloud [10]. IoT technology
    is widely used and can also be applied to many areas of monitoring underground
    geothermal structures. This type of technology is especially useful in locations
    where wireless communications are required. These areas are generally difficult
    or impossible to connect to a power grid, and therefore, alternative power sources
    such as batteries or energy harvesting methods are necessary [11]. In this case,
    monitoring devices must consume low amounts of energy, and suitable technologies
    with powering constraints, for example, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology,
    are therefore required. LPWAN technology was designed for reliable wireless data
    transmission with minimal power consumption. The commonly used LPWAN technologies
    include LoRaWAN, Sigfox and NB-IoT [12]. Table 1 lists recently published reviews
    of monitoring performed in specific underground geothermal structures. The listed
    studies examined a variety of systems that monitor different parameters, are deployed
    in specific types of geothermal structures and employ IoT technology. In Refs.
    [13,14,15], the authors discussed temperature monitoring and the temperature measurement
    methods, sensors and tools suitable for geothermal applications, such as vertical
    borehole heat exchangers, downholes and power plant devices. In Refs. [1,2], the
    authors discussed flow rate sensing techniques, providing comprehensive descriptions
    and comparisons of the two-phase flow monitoring methods applied in geothermal
    pipelines and geothermal wells. In addition to monitoring temperature and flow
    parameters, geothermal applications also use sensors to monitor mechanical parameters,
    such as scale formation [3] and slope movement [4]. In Ref. [4], the authors provided
    an overview of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) combined with IoT devices for monitoring
    slopes. The monitoring of other mechanical parameters has not yet been summarized
    in any recently published survey. The authors of [7,9] discussed the use of WSNs
    in underground coal mine monitoring systems and methods for monitoring leakage
    and sinkholes. The motivation for the current review is the lack of comprehensive
    studies on IoT applications for monitoring underground geothermal structures.
    To our best knowledge, no reviews have summarized the use of IoT technology in
    relation to monitoring geothermal parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow
    rate and mechanical parameters. Table 1. Overview of surveys related to monitoring
    underground geothermal structures. The main contributions of this article are:
    A comprehensive analysis of methods for monitoring specific parameters in underground
    geothermal structures and the currently available monitoring technologies and
    sensors; A description of the state-of-the-art IoT technologies and sensors suitable
    for deployment in underground geothermal structures, including sensor node designs,
    energy harvesting methods, communication interfaces and cloud services; Proposals
    for new, promising application areas and innovations in technology for monitoring
    underground geothermal structures. The scheme of the article is illustrated in
    Figure 1. The article discusses sensing methods for detecting temperature, flow
    rate and other mechanical parameters in underground structures. Section 2 of the
    article provides a deeper analysis of the methods applied to monitor these parameters.
    Section 3 discusses IoT technology, data transmission and cloud services in relation
    to the systems deployed to monitor underground geothermal structures. Section
    4 discusses research challenges. Section 5 summarizes and concludes the article.
    Figure 1. Scheme of the article: sensing parameters in underground structures,
    IoT technology and cloud processing. 2. Sensor Technologies Sensors containing
    specific technologies are necessary for monitoring the subterranean environment
    of a geothermal structure. The ability to continuously monitor such structures
    at a reasonable cost is desirable in terms of improving efficiency and allowing
    the immediate detection of problems and faults [2]. This section examines the
    technologies for measuring temperature, flow rate and other mechanical parameters,
    such as pressure and slope movement, in these specific environments. 2.1. Temperature
    Measurement Temperature monitoring technologies enable the study of geological
    processes and the investigation of subsurface thermal properties. Table 2 lists
    some of the temperature measurement technologies applied in complex systems. The
    principles of these specific temperature measurement technologies are further
    described in this subsection. Table 2. Overview of technologies applied to temperature
    measurement in underground geothermal structures. Depending on the installation
    method, temperature sensing technologies fall into two categories: static installations
    and mobile sensing. Static installation systems are fixed and permanently installed.
    These systems include optical fibres, distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technology,
    thermistors and thermocouples. Static installation sensors are used for temperature
    measurements in geothermal wells, downholes or borehole heat exchangers. Mobile
    sensing uses wireless technology and is not fixed or permanently installed. Mobile
    sensing systems are used, for example, to monitor the temperature of geothermal
    fluid in borehole heat exchangers. 2.1.1. Static Installations Static installations
    deploy thermistors, thermocouples, fibre optic thermometers or DTS technology.
    Thermistors are sensors capable of measuring high-quality temperature–depth information
    from boreholes up to 100 m or more below the Earth’s surface [19]. Thermocouples
    are installed to measure temperatures at the inlets and outlets of geothermal
    heat exchangers [20]. Wired optical sensors provide continuous measurements with
    high-resolution temperature profiles along pipelines [18] and are often attached
    to the outer surface of the pipe wall or located within the underground structure
    itself [21]. DTS technology is used for temperature measurements along various
    types of underground geothermal structures. Measurements are based on detecting
    light from Rayleigh, Raman or Brillouin backscattering phenomena [15]. DTS technology
    measures temperatures using optical fibres that provide a continuous temperature
    distribution profile of the entire cable [22]. This method is able to achieve
    highly accurate temperature measurements over long distances, up to 30 km. This
    technology is very sensitive for monitoring temperature, as it is characterized
    by a spatial resolution of 1 m at an accuracy of ±1 ∘ C and a resolution of 0.01
    ∘ C [23]. This technology works by detecting thermal changes along the optical
    fibre that manifest as molecular or lattice vibrations in the material. In addition,
    thermal changes cause local changes in the refractive index. Changes in the refractive
    index are then manifested as the inelastic scattering of transmitted light. Molecular
    vibrations at high frequencies around 10 THz cause Raman scattering. Brillouin
    scattering is caused by low-frequency vibrations in the range of 10 to 30 GHz.
    This scattering can then be used to measure the temperature along the fibre [24].
    DTS technology is widely applied to inspect subsurface thermal properties. DTS
    can be used in various applications, such as investigating the hydro-geological
    conditions of downholes or determining the geological properties of aquifers.
    Especially in deep boreholes, its application provides notable benefits over discrete-point
    temperature measurements [5]. DTS is widely used in long-term monitoring to determine
    the contribution of groundwater flow and thermophysical characteristics to subsurface
    heat transfer and storage [16]. This type of technology is used to monitor the
    conditions inside well bores to optimize expensive workover procedures [17]. 2.1.2.
    Mobile Sensing Mobile sensing systems such as Geoball and Geosniff are small spheres
    25 mm in diameter and 8 g in weight that have an embedded transceiver, microcontroller,
    temperature sensor and power supply. These miniaturized sensors are inserted into
    the pipes of a geothermal underground structure and are then carried by the thermal
    fluid in order to monitor the thermal parameters of the fluid along the borehole
    heat exchanger. These sensor systems allow the acquisition of information on the
    thermal properties of the subsurface geological structure and their influence
    on the thermal properties of the borehole. A wireless data processing unit sends
    data and acquires configurational information prior to measurement and retrieves
    measured thermal data from a sensor inside the U-tube of the borehole heat exchanger
    [18]. These types of sensors have demonstrable advantages of higher reliability
    and lower cost over standard sensors and fibre optics [13]. Fibre optic technologies
    such as high-temperature distributed acoustic sensors [25] are used for their
    unparalleled ability to discriminate and measure environmental variables such
    as strain, temperature and vibrations [26]. The purpose of the method is to improve
    the conventional thermal response test [18]. Compared to Pt100 sensors, mobile
    sensing systems are highly accurate and do not produce large, statistically significant
    measurement deviations [13]. 2.2. Flow Rate Measurement The measurement of liquid
    and gaseous flow rates in underground geothermal structures is performed to manage
    and control various processes [1]. Flow rate measurement in geothermal structures
    applies techniques that differ in complexity, cost and the capability to perform
    real-time surveys. Table 3 summarizes the differences between individual methods
    of flow rate measurement on the basis of four attributes: the ability to provide
    real-time measurements (real-time), the operational status of the underground
    structure (out of operation), direct contact between the medium and the sensing
    device (direct contact) and a list of the types of underground structures where
    the flow rate measurement method is used (application location). Table 3. Summary
    of methods for measuring flow rate in underground geothermal structures. In summary,
    each method, except for the calorimeter and tracer dilution, provides real-time
    measurements. The calorimeter and lip pressure are the only two methods used in
    decommissioned underground structures. Each method, except for compression load
    cells and the ultrasonic meter, has direct contact with the sensing medium. The
    application location includes geothermal power plants, open Venturi channels,
    geothermal pipelines and geothermal wells. Flow rate measurement can apply single
    flow rate methods or hybrid flow rate methods. Hybrid methods combine two basic
    methods to reduce any deficiencies that single methods may introduce. Hybrid techniques
    are frequently used to measure two-phase fluid flow. The following subsections
    describe the individual methods listed in Table 3 for flow rate measurement and
    estimation. 2.2.1. Ultrasonic Meter Ultrasonic meters are devices that are composed
    of a receiver and transmitter and that use the phenomenon of sonic waves. The
    device is attached to the exterior of a pipeline and used to determine the flow
    rate. The transmitted waves are detected by the receiver. The modification of
    the wave frequency and amplitude is indicative of the properties of the fluid/gas.
    There exist several methods that can be used to calculate the final flow rate,
    for example, based on the time of transit of the sonic waves [36], the Doppler
    Effect [37], cross-correlation [37] or changes in wave amplitude [38]. Ultrasonic
    sensors are used in many areas of industry. In underground structures, at least
    three sensors are used at different points [28], for example, at different locations
    along a channel [27]. The advantage of an ultrasonic meter is that it does not
    come into contact with the fluid/gas medium and is positioned on the outside of
    the pipeline [27]. 2.2.2. Calorimeter Figure 2 depicts a typical calorimeter configuration
    that is used to measure enthalpy in geothermal wells in addition to the flow rate.
    This method works on the principle of measuring the time that it takes to fill
    a partially water-filled tank with geothermal fluid. The time is then used to
    calculate the flow rate [2]. Figure 2. Block diagram of a calorimeter setup. The
    disadvantage of this technique is that it requires the geothermal well to halt
    production [1]. Another disadvantage is that it is only suitable for low-output
    wells, as the amount of discharge is restricted by the volume of the tank that
    can be delivered to the site. Another constraint is the limit on the maximum measurable
    flow rate of 10 kg/s [39]. Measuring the flow rate in this manner is also very
    noisy and cannot be performed in real time [40]. 2.2.3. Sharp-Edged Orifice Plate
    An orifice plate is a well-known alternative method that has been implemented
    in several geothermal applications all over the world [1]. The orifice plate consists
    of a central circular hole that measures differential pressure by establishing
    pressure taps upstream and downstream. Figure 3 [2] illustrates a typical orifice
    plate setup. Figure 3. Orifice plate installed at a geothermal well. Orifice plates
    are frequently used to measure the flow of geothermal steam; extracting steam
    from the ground is the first crucial step in converting geothermal steam energy
    into electricity [41]. The devices also measure brine flow [2] and can identify
    the mass flow rate of the well [42]. 2.2.4. Tracer Dilution Method Tracer dilution
    is used to measure the enthalpy of geothermal fluid in addition to the flow rate.
    To determine the well performance, two different chemical tracers are injected
    into the fluid stream in the pipe and mixed with water. Fluid tracers disperse
    into a liquid phase; gas tracers mainly disperse into a gaseous phase, but also
    partially into a liquid phase. Samples of vapor and water are then collected from
    the pipeline and tested to identify the dilution of the tracer in both phases
    and the background concentration. From this information, the flow rate and enthalpy
    can be estimated [1]. The advantages of this method are the ability to keep the
    well online during measurement and the lack of an effect on the flow; they are
    outweighed, however, by the large costs for lab testing [1], the poor precision
    of the results [2] and the lack of real-time measurement capability [43]. 2.2.5.
    Lip Pressure Method This method entails the use of a small hole measuring 6 mm
    in diameter and located 6 mm away from the pipe lip. Empirical measurements of
    pressure are taken at this hole, and using the size of the pipe, an empirical
    correlation is used to calculate the flow rate. Enthalpy and the total flow can
    be determined based on information obtained from the flow rate and lip pressure
    [32]. Two arrangements are available for this method, one in which fluid is discharged
    into the atmosphere through a vertical lip pressure pipe and another in which
    it is discharged horizontally into a silencer on a horizontal lip pressure pipe.
    In the vertical arrangement, the pipe is connected to the top valve in a vertical
    position, and the fluid’s enthalpy must be estimated based on the temperature
    of the primary supply zone [1]. In the horizontal arrangement, the pipe discharges
    into the silencer, and the weir box located immediately downstream of the silencer
    monitors the water flow. The method’s advantages include low running costs and
    real-time measurements, but it also has drawbacks, such as high noise levels and
    interruptions in operations during measurement [44]. 2.2.6. Venturi Tube The Venturi
    tube method is based on Bernoulli’s principle and is a very precise method used
    for measuring steam flow [34]. The method can be used for online or real-time
    measurement, and its main advantage is a low and constant pressure drop. Its construction
    is complicated and expensive, however [2,45]. 2.2.7. Coriolis Flow Meter A Coriolis
    flow meter consists of two curved tubes that vibrate symmetrically. The flow of
    the medium is directed through these pipes, and any local changes in the vibration
    frequency due to the flow rate are monitored. To calculate the flow rate, changes
    in the frequency are measured by sensors, and empirical correlations are applied.
    Although this method enables real-time and online measurement, it is highly inaccurate
    and therefore an unpopular option [2,46]. 2.2.8. Compression Load Cells Compression
    load cells use strain gauge sensors to determine the flow rate and enthalpy in
    geothermal pipelines and wells. The sensor is based on the piezoelectric effect,
    which is based on converting the mechanical power applied by the object (pipeline,
    well) to an electrostatic signal. The load sensor is positioned above a platform
    (compression type, Figure 4a) or above the object (tension type, Figure 4b) [35,47].
    Figure 4. Compression load cell method: An installation in a geothermal pipeline.
    (a) The load sensor is positioned above a platform. (b) The load sensor is positioned
    above an object. The advantages of this method are simple construction, measurement
    in real time and the lack of direct contact with the fluid medium [35,47]. 2.2.9.
    Separator with Orifice Plate and Silencer This hybrid method determines the flow
    of a two-phase fluid and consists of a separator, an orifice plate and a silencer
    with a weir. The fluid separates into vapor and a liquid in a separator vessel
    at a pressure greater than atmospheric. The separate steam flow is measured with
    an orifice plate, while the separate liquid flow is determined with either an
    orifice plate or a silencer with a weir box. Because orifice plates may produce
    unstable measurements due to flash evaporation induced in the liquid, silencers
    are more commonly used for measuring the separate liquid flow. The separator method
    is expensive to implement, but it enables high accuracy and online or real-time
    measurement [1,2]. 2.3. Measurement of Mechanical Parameters In addition to measuring
    temperature and flow, monitoring mechanical parameters in underground structures
    is important for detecting potential risks. Underground structures such as borehole
    heat exchangers must be regularly checked for pressure to ensure that no fluid
    leaks into the subsurface, groundwater or process water. Geothermal applications
    also use sensors to monitor other mechanical parameters, such as scale formation
    [3] and slope movement [4]. Mechanical parameters can be monitored with fibre-optic
    sensors [48], tilt sensors [4], ultrasonic sensors [49], vibrating wire sensors
    [50] or strain gauges [51]. Table 4 summarizes these sensing methods and their
    areas of application. Table 4. Summary of methods for measuring mechanical parameters.
    Pressure is measured with strain gauges or optical sensors, usually in geothermal
    wells or reservoirs. Optical sensors are also used to detect the formation of
    scale in geothermal brine. In boreholes, ultrasonic sensors are deployed to detect
    breakouts, and tilt sensors measure information about slope movement and deformation.
    Vibrating wire sensors are used to measure stress in structures at geothermal
    or oil drilling wells. 2.3.1. Optical Sensors Fibre-optic cables are used to measure
    pressure in geothermal wells [48]. Distributed acoustic sensing systems use fibre-optic
    cables to measure oscillatory strain rates caused by oscillatory pressure changes.
    These cables have significant advantages in being able to withstand harsh environments;
    they can be deployed for geomechanical, seismic and temperature monitoring [53].
    Fibre-optic cables are capable of operating at temperatures up to 315 ∘ C and
    20 MPa [51]. 2.3.2. Vibrating Wire Sensors Vibrating wire sensors can measure
    the stresses occurring in a structure and its surrounding environment. It is a
    frequency sensor with an internal metal string as the sensing component. The sensor’s
    output frequency signal changes according to the the stress on the metal string.
    The device is durable and simple in design and has a strong anti-interference
    ability [50]. The metal string vibrates as a result of excitation when an external
    force is applied, changing the tension in the wire, which changes the frequency
    of vibrations. The dependence between the vibration conductor and the vibration
    frequency is calculated from the equation: 𝑓= 1 2𝐿 𝐹 𝑚 − − √ , (1) where m is
    the mass of the vibrating string, L is the length of the vibrating string, F indicates
    the pressure on the sensor, and f is the resonant frequency of the string [54].
    These sensors are suitable for applications in geothermal or oil drilling wells
    [52]. 2.3.3. Tilt Sensors These sensors are used to obtain information about slope
    movements and deformations. Tilt monitoring systems combine tilt sensors and LPWAN
    technology to measure slope movement and transmit collected data wirelessly. Data
    from tilt sensors and other additional parameters (rainfall data, groundwater
    level) are analyzed to predict slope failures [55]. 3. IoT Devices and Cloud Processing
    IoT technology is a growing research area. In 2021, the Web of ScienceTM library
    contained more than 13,000 indexed papers on the topic of IoT technology [56].
    IoT technologies are deployed in many application areas, such as environmental
    monitoring [10], smart factories [57,58], smart cities [59] and smart grids [11,60].
    Although IoT technology is widely deployed, only a few research articles cover
    the monitoring of geothermal energy installations. Fundamentally, an IoT device
    is an internet connection. In the context of this article, an IoT device is a
    small item of electronic equipment that is able to supervise several variables
    and transmit measured values to the cloud via a wireless connection. Figure 5
    illustrates the principal scheme of the IoT architecture and application areas.
    Figure 5. IoT architecture and application domains. Figure 6 shows a block diagram
    of a typical IoT solution. IoT devices generally contain the following parts:
    a power supply module, a sensory subsystem, a microcontroller (MCU), a transmission
    module (RF module) and data storage. Each block can be assembled from various
    components according to system requirements and deployment characteristics. Figure
    6. Block diagram of a typical IoT solution. 3.1. IoT Nodes An integral component
    of an IoT device is a power supply. To supply the device with power, many options
    are available, the simplest being a connection to a power grid; an example is
    an AC power monitoring module with an integrated wireless connection via WiFi
    [61]. Power grids provide sources of stable and reliable energy, but they are
    mainly only available in urban locations. Another option is the use of a battery
    [62]. Batteries also provide stable sources of energy, but they require periodic
    charging and replacement. Battery-powered IoT devices can also be designed to
    operate for long life spans [10]. Another option for supplying electricity is
    through energy harvesting methods [63]. Characterized by many advantages, energy
    harvesting modules are small, maintenance-free and inexpensive solutions, especially
    compared to battery-powered options. The main drawback of energy harvesting solutions,
    however, is limited available energy. Table 5 summarizes IoT power supply technologies
    according to the energy transducer type. Selecting a suitable power supply type
    is strongly dependent on the target application [64]. In many geothermal applications
    [65], power grids are readily available, and generally, no energy harvesting or
    battery technologies are required. However, IoT measurement devices are often
    deployed directly in geothermal boreholes, where the installation of a wired power
    supply is complicated [66]. Energy harvesting is therefore a highly suitable technology
    for these applications. Table 5. SoA of IoT power supply technologies. Energy
    harvesting using solar panels or small wind turbines is suitable only for surface
    deployment, where sunlight and wind are sufficient [72]. For underground structures,
    thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have significant potential as an energy harvesting
    technology. TEGs exploit the Seebeck effect to generate energy through temperature
    differentials [73]. The main challenge with this technology is finding suitable
    temperature differences or gradients directly in a borehole for exposure to the
    TEG. Acting as brains, microcontrollers (MCUs) regulate IoT node behavior, such
    as sensor data collection, local memory storage and data transmission to the cloud.
    Since IoT nodes generally have only limited energy for operation [74], MCUs are
    also responsible for energy management. Naturally, they are selected from ultra-low-power
    series offered by silicon manufacturers to minimize the MCU’s own consumption.
    Examples of these series types are STM32L [75], NXP K32L [76] and Microchip PIC32MZ
    [77]. Specific models are selected according to the application, and generally,
    higher performance requires more energy. ULP (ultra-low-power) MCUs typically
    offer multiple switchable modes of operation and the ability to switch off individual
    peripherals (clock gating) for effective power management. Switching off all components
    not currently in use thus reduces the overall energy consumption [78,79]. IoT
    nodes are usually equipped with local data storage, which can be used for either
    the long-term storage of accumulated values or short-term storage (as a memory
    buffer). As with other IoT node components, power consumption is one of the crucial
    parameters in selecting memory and is dependent on the type of memory used. Ferroelectric
    Random-Access Memory (FRAM) is a type of memory technology with low energy consumption,
    but its data capacity is limited to a few dozen MB. At the other end of the spectrum
    of data capacity is flash memory, commonly found in SD cards, with maximum capacities
    of hundreds of GB. The disadvantage of flash memory is higher energy consumption
    and significantly slower data write speeds. Data storage memory may form either
    a discrete component in an IoT node or be integrated into the MCU [80]. 3.2. Data
    Transmission Technologies Underground geothermal structures are often situated
    in remote areas where no easy connection to the internet for monitoring purposes
    is possible (i.e., WiFi or Ethernet). In these areas, monitoring equipment is
    usually powered by batteries or energy obtained by harvesting (see Section 3.1),
    and energy consumption must be low. GSM/LTE technology does not satisfy this low-power
    requirement, but LPWAN technology is ideal. These types of systems were developed
    for the IoT and feature reliable, long-distance wireless data transmission (1–40
    km), with minimal power consumption. The commonly used LPWAN technologies are
    currently LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT [81,82]. 3.2.1. LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is a wireless
    communication protocol based on the patented LoRa technology. The patent was granted
    in 2014 to Semtec, and the first LoRaWAN protocol specification was released in
    2015. The standards are now managed by the LoRa Alliance. Transceivers have a
    low sensitivity to noise and thus a greater range thanks to forward error correction
    (FEC), together with a proprietary spread spectrum modulation technique. The operating
    radio frequency varies according to the region of deployment and its local regulations,
    but it always belongs to a license-free band. A LoRaWAN network typically includes
    the following network elements. The end device is application-dependent, provides
    control or measurement functions (sensor, actuator) and is wirelessly connected
    to the LoRaWAN network via a gateway. The gateway receives and forwards messages
    (usually via the internet) to a network server. The network server provides network
    management functions such as data processing, message deduplication, configuration
    and scheduling, bandwidth regulation and message routing. The application server
    remotely collects data from sensors and transmits commands to device actuators
    [83,84]. The technology has a range of 5 km (urban) to 20 km (rural) [85]. Depending
    on the configuration, the payload can contain up to 242 bytes of data [86]. LoRa
    defines three device classes: Class A—End devices can start transmission (uplink)
    at any time, while the base station transmits data only for a short time once
    the uplink is complete. Each uplink time slot is followed by two downlink slots,
    after which the receiver switches off. This class has the lowest energy demand.
    Class B—Devices have the same uplink and downlink slots as Class A, plus one extra
    downlink slot. The end-device receiver is switched on for this extra slot according
    to a predetermined schedule. The base station is programmed to follow this schedule.
    Class C—Receivers can listen continuously, except in transmit mode. This class
    of device is ideal for applications that require many downlink transmissions because
    the base station broadcasts at any time. Its disadvantage is higher power consumption
    [87]. 3.2.2. Sigfox Sigfox is a company based in France providing network connectivity
    within the IoT through its eponymous wireless technology. It was founded in 2010
    with a focus on low-consumption IoT devices that require the transmission of small
    amounts of data over longer distances [87]. Sigfox can operate in either simplex
    (one-way) or half-duplex (two-way) mode. An upload packet can comprise a maximum
    of 12 bytes of payload, while a download packet is limited to 8 bytes of payload.
    The operational range of this network reaches up to 40 km [87,88]. Such a value
    is achieved by combining several techniques. The first of them is the use of ultra-narrowband
    (UNB); such a narrow frequency selection increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
    A combination of Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK) and Differential Binary
    Phase-Shift Keying (DBPSK) is used for signal modulation in the physical layer.
    Delivery reliability is increased by sending the same message multiple times.
    Duplicate messages are sent on randomly selected frequencies with random delays
    from the first one. Sigfox relies on a license-free band reserved for industrial,
    scientific and medical (ISM) purposes. The specific frequency then depends on
    the deployment region. In addition to the maximum transmission power, the regulation
    also sets a duty cycle limit. Because of this, the end device is limited to 140
    messages per day in the case of sending and 4 messages in the case of receiving
    [88,89]. 3.2.3. NB-IoT Narrowband IoT is another LPWAN technology available today.
    It was developed by the 3GPP organization, with the first NB-IoT standard defined
    in 2016. This communication network is based on and is directly linked to the
    GSM/LTE cellular network standard. Modifications consist of changes in the original
    technology to best meet the requirements for IoT end-device network connectivity
    (such as low power consumption, low cost or the transmission of small amounts
    of data over longer distances). Compared to the LTE protocol, NB-IoT only allows
    half-duplex at a bandwidth of 180 kHz. Modulation schemes more complex than 𝜋/4
    –QPSK are not supported. Not all parts of the E-UTRA specification are implemented
    either. Thanks to this aspect, the receiver is simpler and therefore less energy-demanding
    and lower in price [90,91,92]. The standard allows transmission using both unlicensed
    bands and licensed GSM/LTE brands in one of the following operation modes: Stand-alone
    operation—When using this mode, NB-IoT is the exclusive user of the selected frequency
    band. Guard-band operation—In this mode, NB-IoT data are transmitted through an
    unused frequency band next to, or between, LTE bands (the so-called guard band).
    In-band operation—LTE data together with NB-IoT data share the same carrier. This
    can have a negative impact on the quality of both services [90,93]. The existing
    LTE network provider often only needs to modify the software to operate the NB-IoT
    network if it decides to deploy the guard-band or in-band model. This approach
    is also recommended by the 3GPP organization itself. The usable distance of the
    IoT node from the base station is up to 10 km [85]. The payload of one message
    is limited to 1600 bytes. There is no limit on the number of messages transferred
    per day when using the licensed band. NB-IoT relies, like the LTE protocol, on
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to transmit downlink messages.
    In the case of uplink transactions, OFDM is replaced by single-carrier frequency
    division multiple access (SC-FDMA). This reduces the value of the peak-to-average
    power ratio (PAPR) [94]. 3.2.4. Comparison of LPWANs The information in Table
    6 indicates that the individual technologies differ, although they are all specific
    to LPWANs. The key advantage of Sigfox over its competitors is the size of the
    area covered by a single base station, up to 40 km in rural areas. Under the same
    conditions, the main competitors achieve a coverage of approximately 20 km with
    LoRaWAN and 10 km with NB-IoT [95]. NB-IoT is also limited to areas with LTE networks.
    In terms of deployment, LoRaWAN allows the creation of private networks, while
    the other two technologies rely only on the provider deployment model [96]. NB-IoT
    is aligned with applications that require the transfer of large amounts of data
    or that need a low-latency network. Sigfox offers a payload volume approximately
    100 times lower than NB-IoT (maximum 1600 B). LoRaWAN provides a payload of 242
    B, and latency can be reduced using class C devices [86]. All of these technologies
    offer sleep modes to reduce the energy consumption of a transmitter to a minimum
    when the end device is not transmitting. NB-IoT nodes have higher power requirements
    than LoRaWAN and Sigfox, drawing the highest peak currents during transmission
    through the use of QPSK modulation in combination with OFDM-FDMA and QoS handling
    [85,97]. LoRaWAN and Sigfox are ALOHA-based and operate on unlicensed frequencies.
    NB-IoT relies on licensed LTE bands, which ensure higher QoS through regulation,
    but a consequence is a higher price for the end customer due to license fees [95].
    Table 6. Summary of LPWAN parameters [85,95,97]. 3.3. Cloud Services Cloud services
    involve infrastructure, platforms and software delivered on demand to companies
    and customers via the internet. Cloud services employ cloud computing solutions
    and do not encumber the hardware or software of devices accessing the service.
    The variety of available cloud services may disguise the level of an organization’s
    ownership of the stack [98]. For clarity, cloud service models can be grouped
    into four main categories according to how they are managed (Figure 7). Figure
    7. Cloud model types: on premises, infrastructure as a service, platform as a
    service and software as a service. On Premises (Private Cloud)—This cloud model
    is in fact not a genuine cloud service. It is suitable for users who require data
    protection and security and are willing to pay more for the service. Because data
    and all infrastructure, including software and hardware, are on the premises,
    the system is managed by the user’s own IT team. In-house maintenance requirements
    and fixed scalability mean that this type of deployment is the most expensive.
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—IaaS allows customers to outsource equipment
    such as storage, servers and network resources. The remainder of the stack is
    managed by the customer. The disadvantage of IaaS is the potential for vendor
    outages and the cost of training personnel to manage new infrastructure. Platform
    as a Service (PaaS)—The provider manages everything as in IaaS but is also responsible
    for the base software and operating system, middleware and database. The drawback
    of PaaS is potential security problems and greater dependency on the vendor. Software
    as a Service (SaaS)—This model completely transfers the management of all components
    to the vendor service provider [99,100]. Table 7 summarizes the features of three
    widely used cloud services: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure IoT, Google
    Cloud Platform [101,102,103], and IBM cloud [104]. Generally, these state-of-the-art
    cloud providers dedicate broad support to services and applications designed for
    the IoT and standard communication interfaces for connecting IoT devices to a
    cloud. They also feature powerful scalable data storage and support for big data
    analysis. Table 7. Summary of parameters and features offered by major cloud providers.
    3.4. Edge Computing Edge computing is a method with enormous potential for IoT
    geothermal monitoring. Edge computing allows some computation and data storage
    to be moved closer to the source of the data, enabling the optimization of IoT
    node transmissions. Geothermal installations make use of a specific IoT domain.
    Table 8 provides a summary of some service-oriented architectures for edge computing
    methods suitable for use in geothermal installations. Early warning systems can
    monitor a geothermal installation and evaluate hazardous states. An example of
    this type of solution is an early warning system for railway bridges [105]. Edge
    computing also allows the real-time monitoring of natural disasters such as fires
    [106] or earthquakes [107]. These solutions tolerate multiple node faults and
    partial network disruptions and store all data locally, which also enhances privacy
    [107]. Table 8. SoA for edge computing methods. Other types of edge computing
    methods manage data compression. Data compression performed locally significantly
    reduces the volume of data for transmission [109]. Data compression can be lossy
    or lossless. The scientific literature on data compression in edge computing is
    vast [110]. 3.5. IoT in Geothermal Applications IoT is chosen over telemetry in
    geothermal installations due to its ability to provide continuous monitoring and
    real-time data collection of temperature, pressure, and other mechanical parameters.
    IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can collect data from various points
    in the geothermal installation, providing a more comprehensive view of the system’s
    performance. Additionally, IoT devices can transmit data wirelessly, eliminating
    the need for wired connections and reducing installation and maintenance costs
    [111]. Comparison of Telemetry Systems and IoT Device is sumarized in Table 9.
    Table 9. Comparison of Telemetry Systems and IoT Devices. Compared to telemetry,
    IoT has several advantages in terms of temperature, pressure, or mechanical parameter
    measurement. Firstly, IoT devices can collect data from multiple sensors simultaneously,
    providing a more comprehensive view of the system’s performance [112]. Secondly,
    IoT devices can transmit data wirelessly, eliminating the need for wired connections
    and reducing installation and maintenance costs [113]. Thirdly, IoT devices can
    be programmed to send alerts when certain parameters exceed predefined thresholds,
    allowing for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention. The
    lack or improper use of telemetry in geothermal installations can lead to several
    problems. Firstly, telemetry systems can be expensive to install and maintain,
    especially in remote locations. Secondly, telemetry systems can be prone to signal
    interference and data loss, leading to inaccurate or incomplete data. Thirdly,
    telemetry systems can be difficult to integrate with other monitoring systems,
    leading to data silos and reduced visibility of the system’s performance [114].
    In contrast, IoT devices are relatively inexpensive and easy to install and maintain.
    Additionally, IoT devices can be integrated with other monitoring systems, providing
    a more comprehensive view of the system’s performance [115]. Finally, IoT devices
    can be programmed to send alerts when certain parameters exceed predefined thresholds,
    allowing for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention. In summary,
    IoT is chosen over telemetry in geothermal installations due to its ability to
    provide continuous monitoring and real-time data collection of temperature, pressure,
    and other mechanical parameters. IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can
    collect data from various points in the geothermal installation, providing a more
    comprehensive view of the system’s performance. Additionally, IoT devices can
    transmit data wirelessly, eliminating the need for wired connections and reducing
    installation and maintenance costs. The lack or improper use of telemetry in geothermal
    installations can lead to several problems, including high costs, signal interference,
    and data silos [116]. IoT devices have the potential to revolutionize geothermal
    monitoring, but they also pose several challenges that need to be addressed to
    ensure reliable operation and minimize the generation of erroneous data. Here
    are some strategies to confront these challenges: Ensure reliable operation: To
    ensure reliable operation of IoT devices in geothermal installations, it is essential
    to choose devices that are designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions
    of the installation. This includes selecting devices that are rated for high temperatures,
    humidity, and corrosion resistance. Additionally, regular maintenance and calibration
    of the devices can help ensure reliable operation [117]. Prevent malfunctions
    due to exceeding recommended temperature ranges: IoT devices can malfunction if
    they are exposed to temperatures outside their recommended range. To prevent this,
    it is essential to monitor the temperature of the devices and the surrounding
    environment and take appropriate measures to prevent overheating. This can include
    installing cooling systems or using devices with built-in temperature sensors
    and automatic shut-off features. Minimize the generation of erroneous data: IoT
    devices can generate erroneous data due to factors such as sensor drift, signal
    interference, and data loss. To minimize this, it is essential to use high-quality
    sensors and ensure that the devices are properly calibrated and maintained [118].
    Additionally, data validation and error correction algorithms can be used to identify
    and correct erroneous data. Transition from elementary sensors to more complex
    MCU-based IoT devices: The transition from elementary sensors to more complex
    MCU-based IoT devices can bring several implications, including increased complexity,
    higher costs, and the need for specialized expertise. To address these challenges,
    it is essential to carefully evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of using MCU-based
    IoT devices and ensure that the devices are properly designed, installed, and
    maintained. Additionally, training and support for personnel responsible for operating
    and maintaining the devices can help ensure their reliable operation. In summary,
    confronting the challenges posed by IoT devices in geothermal installations requires
    careful consideration of the devices’ design, installation, and maintenance. Strategies
    such as ensuring reliable operation, preventing malfunctions due to exceeding
    recommended temperature ranges, minimizing the generation of erroneous data, and
    carefully evaluating the transition from elementary sensors to more complex MCU-based
    IoT devices can help ensure the successful implementation of IoT-based geothermal
    monitoring systems [119]. In the construction and electronic placement of geothermal
    IoT monitoring systems, careful consideration should be given to the potential
    high temperatures of an environment or a medium [120]. Geothermal environments
    can expose the equipment to extreme heat, which can pose challenges to the proper
    functioning of electronic components. It is crucial to protect the silicon parts
    used in these systems, as they have maximum temperature limits that should not
    be exceeded. Adequate measures and safeguards must be implemented to ensure the
    longevity and reliable operation of IoT devices in such high-temperature conditions
    [121]. The advance of IoT technology has brought about a push for standardization
    in various aspects of its implementation. Standardization includes the adoption
    of common LPWAN communication protocols, the use of standardized components on
    the cloud side, and the establishment of methodologies for creating IoT nodes
    [122]. This standardization effort aims to streamline and simplify the development
    and deployment process of IoT systems. In contrast, telemetry systems often lack
    standardization and are often proprietary, leading to increased expenses and longer
    development cycles. The absence of standardized approaches in telemetry results
    in prolonged development times and delays in bringing products to market, ultimately
    driving up costs. By embracing standardization in IoT, organizations can benefit
    from reduced development costs, shorter time to market, and improved interoperability
    between different IoT devices and systems [123]. 4. Research Challenges This article
    describes options for geothermal monitoring and recent trends in the application
    of IoT technologies. This section discusses research challenges for potential
    applications of IoT sensor technology in underground geothermal structures to
    extend current installations and deliver more robust solutions for future installations.
    Innovations for specific equipment technologies (sensors, edge-computing, energy
    harvesting, IoT nodes, etc.) are also discussed. Figure 8 illustrates the research
    challenges outlined in this article, labeled with four different signs. Undesirable
    states are tagged with a warning sign (exclamation mark within a triangle), innovations
    for improving the design of future applications are tagged with a dollar sign,
    innovations for technology are tagged with a light bulb, and innovations for the
    cloud are tagged with gear wheels. The figure highlights key research challenges
    and provides ideas for addressing them in the field. Implementation of advanced
    sensors holds the potential to significantly enhance the design and performance
    of geothermal installations. The figure introducing the content of the following
    sections. The Section 4.1 on new potential applications explores emerging uses
    of technology in innovative ways, opening up exciting possibilities for industries
    and individuals alike. Technology innovations discussed in the Section 4.2 showcase
    the latest advancements and breakthroughs that have the potential to revolutionize
    various fields and create new opportunities for development. Figure 8. Research
    challenges for various problematic areas. 4.1. New Potential Applications Underground
    geothermal structures are designed for long-term use; therefore, the proper management
    of the installation’s operational life is required. As mentioned in Section 1,
    eliminating undesirable states (e.g., thermal imbalance, the absence of turbulent
    fluid flow and the unforced operation of heat pumps during cooling) during the
    operation of an underground geothermal structure is beneficial. Long-term monitoring
    with IoT sensors can facilitate the optimal operation of underground geothermal
    structures, prolong system endurance and optimize standard operations. Table 10
    lists several undesirable states and potential solutions. Table 10. Undesirable
    states and potential solutions. Thermal imbalance during the operation of an underground
    geothermal structure is caused by the heterogeneity of the rock environment. To
    eliminate thermal imbalances, the monitoring of individual boreholes is a potential
    solution. The absence of turbulent fluid flow can be avoided with higher flow
    rates. Low flow rates in the geothermal structure can be specifically addressed
    with turbocollectors (pipes with spiral ribbing), which guarantee that the Reynolds
    number of the flow is exceeded. The last undesirable state is the operation of
    the heat pump during cooling. The thermal stress of the pile must be monitored
    for mechanical property stability (strength and deformation parameters). A change
    in concrete temperature due to heat transfer (charging and discharging) produces
    a change in the stresses experienced by the concrete in the pile. This change
    in stress consequently produces volumetric changes in the concrete. In critical
    cases, the brittle failure of the concrete occurs, and the bearing capacity of
    the pile as a whole is reduced. Another benefit of the long-term monitoring of
    currently deployed geothermal installations is the continuous data collection
    of operational parameters. Large datasets describing geothermal installation behavior
    during regular operation and also non-standard conditions can be created. IoT
    technologies allow the extensive monitoring of existing structures, and therefore,
    the knowledge base will contain new and important information that is useful for
    design work for future underground geothermal structures. Table 11 lists parameters
    whose monitoring could aid in producing improved designs for future applications.
    Table 11. List of parameters whose monitoring could aid in producing improved
    designs for future applications. Utilizing measurement and monitoring techniques
    for borehole properties, particularly temperature and flow rate, presents an opportunity
    to enhance future applications. Flow rate monitoring could aid in techno-economic
    optimization through the selection of suitable pipe diameters and optimal energy
    consumption models. Temperature monitoring could be applied to optimize designs
    for the well depth (the length of the borehole). Many underground geothermal structure
    walls do not permit the use of sensor technologies due to wired sensor limitations
    or the absence of power grid connections. Such installations may include sensors
    that are installed during the construction process and are subsequently inaccessible
    or insular systems where a power supply connection is difficult to build. Energy
    harvesting technologies have excellent potential as solutions for such cases through
    their ability to generate electricity for sensor operation directly from the ambient
    environment. IoT monitoring systems for geothermal structures can be powered by
    harvesting energy from the environment. Table 12 lists energy harvesting methods
    suitable for powering these types of IoT sensors. The most promising energy harvesting
    method is the use of TEG technology, whose main advantage is the absence of moving
    mechanical parts and the possibility of placing the device directly into a borehole.
    Another option is to use water pipeline energy harvesting. This type of energy
    harvesting system can also be placed into a borehole, but only inside a pipe.
    Water pipeline energy harvesting modules also have the disadvantage of moving
    mechanical parts. The third energy harvesting option is solar and wind energy.
    Solar panels or wind turbines cannot be placed into boreholes, however, and must
    be located on the surface and be connected to the IoT sensor inside the borehole
    with wires. Table 12. List of energy harvesting methods suitable for powering
    sensors used to monitor underground geothermal structure parameters. 4.2. Technological
    Innovations The process of constructing an underground geothermal structure requires
    many technological components. Most of these components do not support direct
    monitoring, and deploying sensors in existing installations is therefore problematic.
    The next generation of components could integrate physical sensors directly into
    equipment. A solution such as this not only permits IoT monitoring but also provides
    a sensory interface for any type of analytical equipment, such as DTS technology.
    In principle, components with embedded sensors add value at minimal cost. Technological
    improvements would involve the installation of optical fibres directly into the
    underground geothermal structure and the positioning of temperature sensors in
    the borehole at various depths. These improvements have the potential benefit
    of optimizing the efficiency of the installation. While this solution addresses
    certain aspects of the problem, such as improving functionality or performance,
    it does not still provide a comprehensive solution for maintenance or replacement
    requirements. In order to ensure sustained effectiveness, it is crucial to consider
    the high reliability of components involved. Moreover, a key expectation for this
    solution is its ability to support long-term deployment without significant interruptions
    or failures. Energy harvesting transducers can power IoT sensors, but the transducer
    design must be optimized and aligned with the installation to establish the best
    energy gains. Thermoelectric generators are a promising technology, but they must
    be deployed in environments with effective temperature gradients. Temperature
    gradients for thermoelectric generator purposes are found in environments that
    fluctuate between medium and ambient temperatures, between warm and cold branches,
    and between shallow soil (50 cm below ground) and ambient air. Underground monitoring
    generally faces problems with data transmission. Regular connections with the
    cloud can be solved in two ways: a transmission antenna can be placed on the surface,
    or new types of underground antennae suitable for IoT communications must be developed.
    The final research challenge involves innovating the communication interface and
    cloud data processing. Computationally limited, low-power IoT nodes require effective
    data transmission solutions that can be delivered through edge computing techniques
    or event-based approaches (Table 13). Table 13. Summary of edge computing techniques.
    Edge computing allows metadata analysis in situ and provides significant benefits
    for data transmission; for example, IoT nodes monitoring a geothermal energy installation
    conserve energy and resources by transmitting data only if a hazardous state arises.
    The data transmission time and the volume of data stored in the cloud are reduced
    by storing raw sensor data locally, and the use of cloud computational resources
    is minimized. IoT monitoring systems designed for the real-time collection of
    data from geothermal energy installations can also be optimized with edge computing
    data compression methods to reduce the total volume of transmitted data. Truncated
    data can also be uploaded when energy for transmission is limited, followed by
    detailed data transmission in the future when energy is sufficient. 5. Conclusions
    This article identifies potential research directions for new applications in
    geothermal energy installations and innovations for IoT monitoring technology
    and cloud services. The article contributes an overview of state-of-the-art principles
    in the design of monitoring systems for geothermal energy installations and a
    review of the sensor technologies available for use with IoT devices and cloud
    data processing. Suitable sensor equipment includes devices for monitoring temperature,
    flow rates and other mechanical parameters. The article also reviews IoT technologies,
    sensor node composition, options for data transmission and the features of cloud
    services. Future research targets and several possible directions are outlined
    in the Research Challenges section. State-of-the-art solutions provide the potential
    for new applications that address several problematic conditions in geothermal
    energy installations. Monitoring systems allow the collection of important datasets
    that can be used to improve future designs of geothermal energy installations.
    Several technological innovation techniques could also improve the operation of
    IoT monitoring devices. Operating nodes in monitoring systems can be powered from
    harvested ambient energy to prolong the operating time and reduce costs. Edge
    computing methods can optimize data transmission and power consumption and provide
    early warnings of faulty or inefficient operating conditions in geothermal energy
    installations. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.P.; investigation, T.K.

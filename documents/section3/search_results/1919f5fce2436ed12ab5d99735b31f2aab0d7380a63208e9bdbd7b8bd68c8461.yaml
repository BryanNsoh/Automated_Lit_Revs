    Abstract: Healthcare 4.0 is a recent e-health paradigm associated with the concept\
    \ of Industry 4.0. It\nprovides approaches to achieving precision medicine that\
    \ delivers healthcare services based on the\npatient’s characteristics. Moreover,\
    \ Healthcare 4.0 enables telemedicine, including telesurgery, early\npredictions,\
    \ and diagnosis of diseases. This represents an important paradigm for modern\
    \ societies,\nespecially with the current situation of pandemics. The release\
    \ of the ﬁfth-generation cellular system\n(5G), the current advances in wearable\
    \ device manufacturing, and the recent technologies, e.g.,\nartiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI), edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are the main drivers\
    \ of\nevolutions of Healthcare 4.0 systems. To this end, this work considers introducing\
    \ recent advances,\ntrends, and requirements of the Internet of Medical Things\
    \ (IoMT) and Healthcare 4.0 systems. The\nultimate requirements of such networks\
    \ in the era of 5G and next-generation networks are discussed.\nMoreover, the\
    \ design challenges and current research directions of these networks. The key\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of such systems, including AI and distributed edge computing,\
    \ are discussed.\nKeywords: Internet of Medical Things; Healthcare 4.0; artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence; distributed edge\ncomputing; 5G; e-health\n1. Introduction\nThere\
    \ is a great demand for digitalizing healthcare sectors, especially with the ad-\n\
    vancements in wireless technologies and electronic devices. Healthcare 4.0 is\
    \ the latest\nparadigm in healthcare systems incorporating modern technologies,\
    \ including the Internet\nof Things (IoT), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), and cloud\
    \ computing [1,2]. It refers to adapting\nhealth-management systems, which can\
    \ be achieved via cloud computing and mobile\ncommunications. Clinical images\
    \ can be continuously evaluated with greater precision and\naccuracy through digitalization\
    \ [3].\nQuality healthcare is a fundamental human right; it is not always provided\
    \ adequately\nworldwide. Chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes,\
    \ have substantially\nincreased due to global economic changes. The most signiﬁcant\
    \ risk to human health\ncomes from chronic disorders. Also, if a disease were\
    \ to spread, it would cause an inﬂux of\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177435\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n2 of 36\npatients\
    \ to the hospitals, burdening medical facilities’ capacity to care for everyone.\
    \ For\ninstance, the global spread of COVID-19 is straining medical facilities\
    \ around the globe [4].\nHealthcare 4.0 refers to integrating digital technologies,\
    \ data analytics, and AI in\nhealthcare [1]. This includes telehealth, electronic\
    \ health records, AI-driven diagnostics,\nand personalized medicine [5]. AI-driven\
    \ diagnostics can provide accurate and timely\ndiagnoses, improving treatment\
    \ outcomes. Telehealth services can improve access to\nhealthcare and reduce the\
    \ burden on physical facilities [6].\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is\
    \ another paradigm expected to revolutionize\nthe healthcare sector and provide\
    \ novel healthcare services [7]. The IoMT is expected\nto continue expanding with\
    \ advancements in sensor technology, connectivity, and data\nanalytics. More medical\
    \ devices will be connected, allowing for real-time monitoring,\nremote patient\
    \ care, and early detection of health issues. It can improve patient outcomes\n\
    by enabling continuous monitoring, personalized treatments, and remote care. Real-time\n\
    data transmission can facilitate early intervention, reducing complications and\
    \ hospital\nreadmissions [8].\nBy leveraging technology, healthcare systems can\
    \ become more proactive, personal-\nized, and efﬁcient. However, data security,\
    \ privacy, and implementation challenges should\nalso be addressed to maximize\
    \ the beneﬁts of these advancements [1,5].\nThis review work investigates the\
    \ current state-of-the-art healthcare systems, including\nHealthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\
    \ It provides a deeper understanding of Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\nThe main contributions\
    \ of this review are summarized as follows.\nA.\nProviding insight into the Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 paradigm and its main features.\nResearchers can beneﬁt from understanding\
    \ the Healthcare 4.0 paradigm and its\nmain features by gaining a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the current state of healthcare\ntechnology. This knowledge\
    \ can guide their research focus, helping them align their studies\nwith the pressing\
    \ needs and challenges in healthcare. Furthermore, researchers can identify\n\
    gaps in the current implementation of Healthcare 4.0, offering opportunities for\
    \ future\nresearch and innovation.\nBy having a clear understanding of the main\
    \ features of Healthcare 4.0, researchers\ncan also identify potential collaborations\
    \ with industry partners and healthcare institutions.\nThis collaboration can\
    \ foster the translation of research ﬁndings into real-world applications,\naccelerating\
    \ the adoption of Healthcare 4.0 technologies and positively impacting patient\n\
    care on a broader scale.\nB.\nIntroducing the main requirement of Healthcare 4.0\
    \ systems and IoMT.\nUnderstanding the main requirements of Healthcare 4.0 systems\
    \ empowers healthcare\npractitioners to adapt to the latest technological advancements\
    \ in their practice. They\ncan integrate data analytics and AI tools to make evidence-based\
    \ decisions, personalize\ntreatment plans, and improve patient outcomes. Awareness\
    \ of data security and privacy\nrequirements helps practitioners implement measures\
    \ to protect medical data.\nThe main requirements of Healthcare 4.0 systems provide\
    \ researchers with clear\ndirections. They can focus on developing innovative\
    \ technologies or solutions that address\nthe speciﬁc needs of the healthcare\
    \ industry in this paradigm. The introduction of IoMT\nopens up numerous research\
    \ opportunities. Researchers can explore the potential of new\nmedical devices,\
    \ algorithms, and applications in remote monitoring, diagnostics, and\npatient\
    \ care.\nC.\nProviding the key enabling technologies of Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\n\
    By providing an in-depth understanding of key enabling technologies, researchers\n\
    can explore their potential and limitations, fostering innovation and discoveries\
    \ in the\nHealthcare 4.0 paradigm. Embracing these technologies and concepts can\
    \ lead to improved\npatient care, enhanced healthcare operations, and groundbreaking\
    \ research that can shape\nthe future of healthcare delivery. Moreover, these\
    \ technologies offer researchers the tools\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n3 of 36\n\
    to tackle pressing healthcare challenges and improve patient care, making their\
    \ research\nhighly relevant and impactful in shaping the future of healthcare\
    \ delivery.\nD.\nDiscussing the research directions for Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\n\
    Discussing research directions for Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT is essential because\
    \ it helps\nguide researchers in identifying areas of study that are relevant,\
    \ impactful, and aligned\nwith the evolving needs of the healthcare industry.\
    \ As Healthcare 4.0 continues to develop,\nnew challenges and opportunities emerge,\
    \ requiring researchers to focus their efforts on\nspeciﬁc research directions\
    \ that can bring about transformative changes in healthcare.\nHealthcare 4.0 and\
    \ IoMT encompass a wide range of technologies and applications.\nDiscussing research\
    \ directions helps researchers identify speciﬁc topics that are currently\nrelevant\
    \ and have the potential to address pressing healthcare challenges. It allows\
    \ re-\nsearchers to prioritize their efforts on areas that can lead to signiﬁcant\
    \ advancements and\npractical solutions.\nThe rest of the work is organized as\
    \ follows.\nSection 2 introduces the e-health\nparadigm, including deﬁnitions,\
    \ challenges, and main categories. Section 3 investigates\nthe characteristics\
    \ of WBAN, distinguishing it from mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)\nand wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs). It also introduces the categories of medical sensors\n\
    and the communication interfaces used for WBANs, IoMT, and Healthcare 4.0. Section\
    \ 4\npresents the main features and challenges of Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT. Section\
    \ 5 provides\ndetails on the key technologies that can assist the evolution of\
    \ IoMT and Healthcare 4.0.\nSection 6 gives insights into future research directions.\
    \ Section 7 presents the ethical\nimplications of Healthcare 4.0.\n2. E-Health\n\
    Nowadays, many people are talking about e-health, yet few of them have come up\n\
    with a deﬁnition that explains this relatively new term. This term was rarely\
    \ used before\n1999, and now this term seems similar to a “buzzword” describing\
    \ “Internet medicine” and\neverything related to computer-based medical services.\
    \ Industry leaders and employees\nused this term for the ﬁrst time in marketing\
    \ rather than academics. They use the term\nproportionately to other “e-words”,\
    \ e.g., e-business, e-commerce, and e-solution [9].\nIt described the new possibilities\
    \ that the Internet opens to healthcare. For instance,\nIntel deﬁnes e-health\
    \ as “a collaborative effort by healthcare and high technology industry\nleaders\
    \ to realize the full potential of the Internet’s role in healthcare delivery”\
    \ [10].\nRecent deﬁnitions of e-health in the electronic environment place it\
    \ at the point where\nmedical informatics, public health, and commercial activities\
    \ converge. It offers medical\nservices and information via the Internet and related\
    \ technologies. E-health describes not\nonly technical aspects, but also the mindset,\
    \ and way of thinking to enhance local, regional,\nand global healthcare using\
    \ information and communication technologies (ICTs) [11].\nAmong the components\
    \ of e-health are telemedicine, decision support systems, elec-\ntronic consultations,\
    \ and electronic health records (EHR). Computer-generated prescrip-\ntions have\
    \ many advantages, such as linkages to programs emphasizing drug or drug\ngroups’\
    \ hazards. Computers are now fundamental to most healthcare practices that initially\n\
    give electronically recorded patient information [12].\n2.1. Challenges of E-Health\n\
    Thanks to rapid technological breakthroughs, new e-health solutions have been\
    \ con-\ntinually growing to fulﬁll the needs of contemporary practice. Appropriate\
    \ technology\ninfrastructure, systems integration, standards, and social, ethical,\
    \ and economic challenges\nare all major roadblocks to widespread e-health adoption\
    \ and the delivery of higher-quality,\nmore productive healthcare. In the era\
    \ of modern communication networks, e-health\nsystems are expected to meet the\
    \ following demands [13–15].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n4 of 36\n(1)\nTimeliness\n\
    Healthcare systems and organizations should be structured in such a way that patients\n\
    can receive care quickly in real-time. Misdiagnosis or inability to diagnose a\
    \ medical\nproblem, illness, or injury in a timely manner, while occasionally\
    \ harmless, can lead to the\ncondition worsening and worsening results. Thus,\
    \ many medical services are announced\nas ultra-reliable low latency (URLL) services.\n\
    (2)\nSecurity and Privacy\nPrivacy, or the capacity to keep an individual’s medical\
    \ information conﬁdential\nfrom unauthorized parties. To achieve this goal, speciﬁc\
    \ activities must be taken, such as\ncorrect patient identiﬁcation, improved communication,\
    \ adequate care, and reduced risk of\nunfavorable outcomes.\nDue to the critical\
    \ importance of medical data, high-security algorithms should be\ndeployed to\
    \ secure medical data. Moreover, due to the constraints on medical devices’\n\
    energy and the size of data packets communicated over the network, novel energy-aware\n\
    quantum security schemes are recommended to be introduced for e-health systems.\n\
    (3)\nCost efﬁcient\nHealthcare services should be reasonably priced due to their\
    \ high importance. Thus,\ncost-efﬁcient devices and solutions should be introduced\
    \ to e-health systems to provide\nmedical services at the expected cost.\n(4)\n\
    Effective care\nE-health services should be supported by scientiﬁc proof, e.g.,\
    \ laboratory tests, clin-\nical research, and epidemiological studies. Application\
    \ servers of medical networks\nshould have interfaces and links to medical facilities\
    \ and be monitored by the operators in\nthese facilities.\n(5)\nEquity\nIt implies\
    \ giving everyone the same level of care, regardless of gender, color, education,\n\
    geography, or socioeconomic situation.\n(6)\nPatient-centered healthcare\nThis\
    \ includes tailoring healthcare services to the individual patient’s requirements,\n\
    values, and preferences.\n2.2. Main Categories of E-Health Systems\nThe numerous\
    \ ways digital and mobile technologies are used to meet health system\ndemands\
    \ are classiﬁed as e-health interventions. This classiﬁcation framework, aimed\n\
    primarily at public health audiences, attempts to create an accessible and bridging\
    \ language\nfor health program planners to explain the functions of e-health systems.\
    \ This classiﬁcation\nmethod is based on the concept of an e-health intervention,\
    \ which is a distinct function\nof digital technology used to achieve healthcare\
    \ goals [1,5]. Figure 1 provides the recent\nclassiﬁcations of e-health systems\
    \ according to technological evolution. E-health systems\ncan be classiﬁed into\
    \ wireless body area networks (WBAN), Internet of Medical Things\n(IoMT), and\
    \ Healthcare 4.0.\nWBANs typically comprise small nodes that record body health\
    \ indicators, including\npulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and glucose\
    \ level. Such networks aim to\nprovide patients with long-term health surveillance\
    \ under the supervision of medical\nauthorities without interfering with their\
    \ daily lives. WBAN is a wireless network of small,\nlow-power, and minimally\
    \ invasive sensors attached to or implanted in a person’s body to\nmonitor vital\
    \ signs or other physiological data. The sensors collect and wirelessly transmit\n\
    data to a central monitoring system, i.e., the sink node [16].\nSensors 2023,\

    \ the sink node [16]. \n \nFigure 1. Classification of e-health systems. \nThe\
    \ IoMT is a network of medical devices and applications connected to the Internet\
    \ \nand communicating with one another. This technology provides healthcare professionals\
    \ \nwith real-time diagnostic data and data that can be used to make more informed\
    \ decisions. \nThe IoMT consists of dense medical devices, including wearable\
    \ devices, remote monitor-\ning systems, and medical implants [8]. It works by\
    \ gathering data from numerous medical \ndevices, transmitting it to a central\
    \ system or database, and analyzing it to provide in-\nsights into patient health\
    \ or to enhance healthcare workflows. IoMT is viewed as a tool to \nenhance patient\
    \ outcomes, lower healthcare expenses, and boost the effectiveness of \nhealthcare\
    \ delivery [17]. \nWBAN focuses specifically on monitoring physiological parameters\
    \ and collecting \ndata directly from the human body. However, IoMT involves a\
    \ broader ecosystem of med-\nical devices and technologies beyond the body itself\
    \ [18]. \nHealthcare 4.0 or Health 4.0 is the term used to describe the fourth\
    \ industrial revolu-\ntion in healthcare, involving integrating advanced digital\
    \ technologies, e.g., AI, and IoT \ndevices to enhance healthcare delivery systems\
    \ [19]. It is an advanced form of healthcare \nthat incorporates digital and networking\
    \ technologies, leading to enhanced patient care. \nHealthcare 4.0 is the next\
    \ evolution of the healthcare industry that has the potential \nto reshape the\
    \ way healthcare is delivered, making it more efficient, effective, and acces-\n\
    sible to everyone. Healthcare 4.0 goes beyond just technology and focuses on transform-\n\
    ing the entire healthcare delivery system. It encompasses IoMT as a part of its\
    \ larger \nframework [20]. \n3. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)  \n3.1. Characteristics\
    \ of WBAN \nThis section investigates the characteristics of WBAN, distinguishing\
    \ it from MA-\nNETs and WSNs. WBANs are interconnected devices mounted on, in,\
    \ or around the hu-\nman body. Medically implanted and wearable sensors are wildly\
    \ popular in the context \nof E-Healthcare. IEEE 802.15.6 is an alternative name\
    \ for the WBAN standard created by \nthe IEEE 802.15 working group [21]. The structure\
    \ of a WBAN typically includes the fol-\nlowing components [16,22]: \n(1) Medical\
    \ sensors: These small, low-power devices collect data from the human body. \n\
    They can be attached to the skin, implanted in tissues, or ingested by the patient.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Classiﬁcation of e-health systems.\nThe IoMT is a network of medical\
    \ devices and applications connected to the Internet\nand communicating with one\

    \ data and data that can be used to make more informed decisions.\nThe IoMT consists\

    \ and medical implants [8]. It works by gathering data from numerous medical\n\
    devices, transmitting it to a central system or database, and analyzing it to\
    \ provide insights\ninto patient health or to enhance healthcare workﬂows. IoMT\
    \ is viewed as a tool to enhance\npatient outcomes, lower healthcare expenses,\
    \ and boost the effectiveness of healthcare\ndelivery [17].\nWBAN focuses speciﬁcally\
    \ on monitoring physiological parameters and collecting\ndata directly from the\
    \ human body. However, IoMT involves a broader ecosystem of\nmedical devices and\
    \ technologies beyond the body itself [18].\nHealthcare 4.0 or Health 4.0 is the\
    \ term used to describe the fourth industrial revolution\nin healthcare, involving\

    \ just technology and focuses on trans-\nforming the entire healthcare delivery\
    \ system. It encompasses IoMT as a part of its larger\nframework [20].\n3. Wireless\
    \ Body Area Network (WBAN)\n3.1. Characteristics of WBAN\nThis section investigates\
    \ the characteristics of WBAN, distinguishing it from MANETs\nand WSNs. WBANs\
    \ are interconnected devices mounted on, in, or around the human\nbody. Medically\
    \ implanted and wearable sensors are wildly popular in the context of\nE-Healthcare.\
    \ IEEE 802.15.6 is an alternative name for the WBAN standard created by the\n\
    IEEE 802.15 working group [21]. The structure of a WBAN typically includes the\
    \ following\ncomponents [16,22]:\n(1)\nMedical sensors: These small, low-power\
    \ devices collect data from the human body.\nThey can be attached to the skin,\
    \ implanted in tissues, or ingested by the patient.\n(2)\nWireless transceivers:\
    \ The hardware responsible for sending and receiving data\nbetween the sensors\
    \ and the central monitoring system. Various wireless communi-\ncation technologies,\
    \ including Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Wi-Fi, can be supported by the\nWBAN transceivers.\n\
    (3)\nCentral monitoring system: The network sink, i.e., the coordinator device\
    \ receives and\nprocesses the data from the distributed medical sensors. It has\
    \ higher communication\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n6 of 36\ncapabilities and supports\
    \ multiple communication interfaces. A body control unit\n(BCU), a body gateway,\
    \ or a sink are all terms used to describe this equipment. A\npersonal digital\
    \ assistant (PDA) or smartphone can sometimes be used instead of\na dedicated\
    \ unit. The primary goal of this unit is to collect all of the data collected\n\
    by the sensors and actuators and convey it to the user (patient, nurse, etc.)\
    \ over\nan external gateway. This gadget has a power unit, a huge processor, vast\
    \ memory,\nand a transmitter.\nSeveral important distinct characteristics distinguish\
    \ WBAN, summarized in\nTable 1 [23–25].\nTable 1. Main characteristics of WBAN.\n\
    Feature\nWBAN\nReliability\n•\nIt refers to the ability of WBAN to consistently\
    \ and accurately transmit and deliver data from medical\nsensors to the intended\
    \ destinations without loss, or corruption.\n•\nThe reliability of WBAN should\
    \ be higher than that of regular sensor networks due to the importance of\nmedical\
    \ data.\nEnergy\n•\nDeployed devices in WBAN are battery-operated, which puts\
    \ many constraints on the network design.\n•\nBatteries may be easily swapped\
    \ out in the not implanted sensor; however, it is complicated for sensors\nimplanted\
    \ surgically in the patient’s body.\nHuman-centric\n•\nWBANs are attached directly\
    \ to body parts in order to capture data as a collection of sensed information.\n\
    •\nThe human body is both exceedingly sensitive and receptive to these sensors.\
    \ Therefore, these sensors\nmust be safe and simple for the human body to accept.\n\
    Availability\n•\nWBANs should support high availability since medical data are\
    \ critical.\n•\nLinks between devices and the network sink should always be available.\n\
    Mobility\n•\nWBAN should support moderate-to-high mobility since devices are attached\
    \ to humans.\n•\nBased on daily life activities, the mobility of sensor nodes\
    \ changes, and thus the network should provide\nstable performance for different\
    \ mobilities.\nScalability\n•\nUnlike wireless sensor networks, WBANs are small-scale\
    \ networks dedicated to speciﬁc\nmedical applications.\n•\nDepending on their\
    \ size, up to ﬁfteen sensors are afﬁxed in, on, or around the user’s body.\nDeployment\n\
    •\nNumerous sensors are connected directly to exit sites and gateways in these\
    \ networks, localizing sensors\nto form a dense network.\n•\nUnlike WSNs, WBANs\
    \ have no constraints in terms of dense deployment scenarios. However, WBANs\n\
    suffer from interferences between nearby WBANs, which are limited in large-scale\
    \ WSNs.\nTopology\n•\nWBAN does not have constraints on network topology, and\
    \ thus there is no ﬁxed topology associated\nwith it.\n•\nDynamic, efﬁcient topologies,\
    \ including stars, meshes, hybrids, and clusters, are all useful in WBANs.\nBandwidth\n\
    •\nThe bandwidth of WBANs varies depending on the speciﬁc technology and protocol\
    \ used.\n•\nShort-range communication technologies, including Bluetooth, Zigbee,\
    \ and Wi-Fi, are commonly used for\nWBANs; however, battery usage is challenging\
    \ with such interfaces. Therefore, the bandwidth of WBANs\ncan range from hundreds\
    \ of kbps up to a few Mbps, depending on the deployed technology and protocol.\n\
    Numerous beneﬁts of WBANs make them more appealing to researchers and the\nindustry\
    \ compared to traditional medical strategies and old sensor networks [22]. They\n\
    are non-surgical networks that autonomously monitor and transmit the patient’s\
    \ health\nstatus to a nearby coordinator device. Then, this device transmits medical\
    \ information to\nhospital-based healthcare professionals for further analysis\
    \ to make the appropriate medical\ndecision for the patient. Such monitoring saves\
    \ time and money because it permits early\ndetection and intervention of health\
    \ issues without violating patient privacy or employing\nfull-time medical personnel\
    \ [16].\nWBANs have many applications; however, most are related to simple and\
    \ traditional\nhealthcare monitoring [26]. The structure of a WBAN is designed\
    \ to enable continuous\nand noninvasive monitoring of a patient’s health status.\
    \ This can be particularly useful\nfor people with chronic medical conditions\
    \ or those requiring close monitoring during\nsurgery recovery [27]. Few recent\
    \ applications have seen the development and deploy-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n\
    7 of 36\nment of WBANs to improve the lives of people with mental and physical\
    \ disabilities,\nspeciﬁc diseases, and pregnant women. The main categories of\
    \ WBAN are summarized as\nfollows [25,28].\na.\nGeneral treatment and diagnosis\
    \ application: WBAN has dominated the medical\nindustry by providing diverse services.\
    \ It improves the efﬁciency of medical activ-\nities, including remote patient\
    \ monitoring, prompt health status, notiﬁcation, and\nemergency phoning, which\
    \ can be carried out anytime and from any location. Some\nof the research’s potential\
    \ medical applications are listed below.\nb.\nElectronic healthcare monitoring\
    \ for older people: This WBAN application aims to\nimprove the health of older\
    \ people who live alone in their homes. An intelligent home\nmonitoring system\
    \ based on medical sensors can be used to observe and evaluate the\nﬁtness of\
    \ older people in their homes. Temperature sensors and other body sensors\nare\
    \ used to detect any abnormalities in the daily activities of older people, including\n\
    sleeping, walking, eating, bathing, and even operating. The network coordinator\
    \ is\nnotiﬁed if an irregularity occurs, and the collected data is sent to medical\
    \ personnel.\nc.\nFighting COVID-19: The WBAN has many applications for ﬁghting\
    \ COVID-19.\nBy reducing the physical presence of patients, remote monitoring\
    \ of COVID-19\nmay signiﬁcantly lower healthcare costs and boost hospital capacity.\
    \ Biomedical\nparameters such as temperature, heartbeat, respiration rate, and\
    \ oxygen saturation\nmust be collected, analyzed, and forwarded to medical personnel\
    \ to monitor the\nsymptoms [28]. WBAN can be easily deployed to assist such applications.\n\
    3.2. Available Medical Sensors\nHealthcare 4.0 requires integrating new and emerging\
    \ technologies, including IoMT\nand WBANs, into healthcare systems. It is an era\
    \ of big data systems comprising massive\ndata from various sources. These data\
    \ types are summarized as follows [29,30].\n(a)\nPatient data: This includes personal\
    \ information of the patient, their medical history,\nvital signs, and any other\
    \ relevant information related to their health.\n(b)\nClinical data: This includes\
    \ data from medical devices, vital signs monitoring systems,\nand other clinical\
    \ instruments used in patient care.\n(c)\nElectronic health records (EHRs): EHRs\
    \ store digital versions of a patient’s medical\nrecord, which includes information\
    \ about their medical history, laboratory test results,\nand any other information\
    \ related to their health.\n(d)\nWearable data: Wearable devices, such as smartwatches,\
    \ ﬁtness trackers, and health\nmonitors, provide data on a patient’s activity\
    \ levels, sleep patterns, and overall health.\n(e)\nSocial determinants of health:\
    \ This includes factors such as a patient’s socioeconomic\nstatus, living conditions,\
    \ and lifestyle choices that can impact their health.\nThese data are generated\
    \ from various sources. This section introduces the main\navailable wireless medical\
    \ sensors deployed for WBANs, IoMT, and Healthcare 4.0. A\nplurality of available\
    \ medical sensors is used to monitor patients’ vitals in real-time and\nmeasure\
    \ a wide range of biological variables [31]. These sensors can be categorized\
    \ as\nfollows [31–33].\n1.\nWearable health trackers include activity, heart rate,\
    \ and blood pressure monitors.\nTable 2 presents the features of the common market\
    \ available wearable watches.\n2.\nConnected health sensors and monitors include\
    \ blood glucose meters, pulse oximeters,\nand electrocardiography (ECG). These\
    \ sensors enable real-time monitoring of medical\nconditions, such as cardiac\
    \ disease, diabetes, and respiratory disease.\n3.\nSmart pill sensors monitor\

    In the rest of this section, we introduce the most common medical sensors.\nA.\n\
    Sensors for pulse rate\nPulse rate sensors, also known as heart rate sensors,\
    \ are devices used to measure\nan individual’s heart rate or pulse rate. They\
    \ are commonly used in ﬁtness trackers,\nsmartwatches, and medical devices. There\
    \ are many pulse rate sensors; however, pho-\ntoplethysmography (PPG) is a common\
    \ technique. PPG sensors detect changes in blood\nvolume using light. Its operation\
    \ mechanism depends on emitting light, usually green or\nred, into the user’s\
    \ skin or ﬁngertip. Blood vessels in the skin or ﬁngertip absorb some of\nthe\
    \ emitted light while the remaining light is reﬂected to the sensor [40]. As the\
    \ heart beats,\nblood ﬂow changes, causing variations in the absorption and reﬂection\
    \ of light. The sensor\ndetects these changes. The detected light variations are\
    \ converted into electrical signals\nand then processed to determine the heart\
    \ rate. The processed data can be displayed on a\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n10 of\
    \ 36\nscreen or transmitted to a connected device for further analysis or tracking\
    \ of the user’s\npulse rate [41].\nIt Is signiﬁcant to mention that various pulse\
    \ rate sensors may vary on this basic\nmethod. Some more advanced sensors employ\
    \ additional technologies, such as the electro-\ncardiogram (ECG), for more precise\
    \ measurements. The different types of market-available\nheart rate sensors are\
    \ introduced as follows [40–42].\n(1)\nOptical sensor: It uses light to detect\
    \ changes in blood volume. A light-emitting diode\n(LED) and a photodetector measure\
    \ the reﬂected light. When blood ﬂow increases\nduring each heartbeat, the amount\
    \ of light reﬂected in the sensor changes, allowing\nthe pulse rate to be calculated.\n\
    (2)\nPiezoelectric sensor: It uses piezoelectric materials that generate voltage\
    \ when sub-\njected to mechanical pressure or vibration. In the context of pulse\
    \ rate measurement,\na piezoelectric sensor can be placed on the skin or a blood\
    \ vessel, and the mechani-\ncal vibrations caused by each heartbeat can be converted\
    \ into an electrical signal to\ndetermine the pulse rate.\n(3)\nCapacitive sensor:\
    \ It measures changes in capacitance between two electrodes caused\nby the pulsating\
    \ blood ﬂow. These sensors typically involve placing the electrodes\non the skin\
    \ or blood vessels, and as the blood ﬂow varies with each heartbeat, the\ncapacitance\
    \ also changes.\n(4)\nECG sensor: It can provide information about the heart’s\
    \ electrical activity. ECG sensor\ndetects the electrical signals generated by\
    \ the heart’s contractions and relaxations.\nVarious parameters, including heart\
    \ rate, can be derived from these signals.\nSelecting pulse rate sensors, for\
    \ different medical applications, should consider several\nfactors that are summarized\
    \ in Table 3 [40–42].\nTable 3. The main features for selecting a pulse rate sensor.\n\
    Feature\nSelection Criteria\nAccuracy and reliability\n•\nThe sensor should provide\
    \ accurate and reliable pulse rate readings, as any inaccuracies can\nlead to\
    \ incorrect diagnosis or treatment.\nSignal quality\n•\nThe sensor should produce\
    \ a clear, high-quality signal that medical professionals or automated\nsystems\
    \ can easily interpret.\nComfort and usability\n•\nConsider the comfort of the\
    \ sensor for the patient, as they may need to wear it for\nan extended period.\n\
    •\nLook for sensors that are non-intrusive, lightweight, and easy to use.\nSensing\
    \ technology\n•\nDifferent sensing technologies are available, such as photoplethysmography\
    \ (PPG),\nelectrocardiography (ECG), or ballistocardiograph (BCG).\n•\nBased on\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of the application, suitable technology is chosen.\nCompatibility\n\
    •\nEnsure the sensor is compatible with the intended medical device or system.\n\
    •\nThis includes interface compatibility, data communication protocols, and power\
    \ requirements.\nEnvironmental\nconsiderations\n•\nEvaluate the intended use environment,\
    \ such as temperature, moisture, or electromagnetic\ninterference, to ensure the\
    \ sensor can withstand and perform well in such conditions.\nCost\n•\nConsider\
    \ the cost implications, as medical sensors can vary in price.\n•\nBalance the\
    \ required features and performance with the available budget.\nRegulatory compliance\n\
    •\nEnsure that the selected sensor meets the necessary medical device regulations\
    \ and\ncertiﬁcations, such as FDA approval or CE marking, depending on the use\
    \ region.\nB.\nPulse oximeters\nA pulse oximeter is a medical device used to measure\
    \ the oxygen saturation level\n(SpO2) in a person’s blood. It is a small, portable\
    \ device that typically clips onto a ﬁnger, toe,\nor earlobe. The pulse oximeter\
    \ emits two wavelengths of light, typically red and infrared,\ninto the body part\
    \ to which it is afﬁxed. The device then measures the light absorbed by the\n\
    blood’s oxygen-carrying hemoglobin. Based on this measurement, the oxygen saturation\n\
    level is calculated and expressed as a percentage. Pulse oximeters are commonly\
    \ utilized\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n11 of 36\nin hospitals and clinics but are\
    \ also available at home. They are particularly useful for\nmonitoring patients\
    \ with respiratory or cardiac conditions and determining the general\nhealth status\
    \ of individuals during physical activity or at high altitudes [43].\nA blood\
    \ oximeter can detect asthma, pneumonia, anemia, lung disorders, and other\nmedical\
    \ conditions. Although a blood oximeter reading of peripheral SpO2 is not always\n\
    comparable to the preferred arterial SpO2, it is considered safe, convenient,\
    \ noninva-\nsive, and affordable. The pulse oximetry method is a valuable tool\
    \ for assessing oxygen\nsaturation in clinical practice [44].\nPulse oximeters\
    \ work based on the principle of spectrophotometry. They emit two\nbeams of light,\
    \ typically red and infrared, through the body part where it is attached. Oxy-\n\
    genated hemoglobin (carrying oxygen) absorbs more infrared light, while deoxygenated\n\
    hemoglobin (without oxygen) absorbs more red light. The pulse oximeter measures\
    \ how\nmuch light the blood absorbs and calculates the oxygen saturation level\
    \ by comparing the\nabsorbed red and infrared light ratio. This data is then displayed\
    \ on the device’s screen,\nshowing the oxygen saturation percentage (SpO2) and\
    \ the pulse rate. The output of a pulse\noximeter indicates the efﬁciency with\
    \ which oxygen is transported to various body regions.\nNormal oxygen saturation\
    \ levels range from 95 to 100 percent. Hypoxemia, characterized\nby insufﬁcient\
    \ oxygen levels in the blood, may be indicated by values below this range [45].\n\
    A common use case of pulse oximeters is their use in airplanes [46]. Airplanes\
    \ need\nsuch a system because passengers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\
    \ (COPD) are\nat risk from the low pressure, low oxygen levels, and low humidity\
    \ that can occur within\nthe cabin during the ﬂight. Therefore, it is essential\
    \ to monitor their health and recognize\nany irregularities promptly so that they\
    \ can receive appropriate care.\nC.\nPPG sensors\nA photoplethysmography (PPG)\
    \ sensor is a device that measures changes in periph-\neral blood vessel blood\
    \ volume. It detects variations in the absorption or reﬂection of light\ncaused\
    \ by blood ﬂow using light sensors. PPG sensors are commonly found in wearable\n\
    devices such as ﬁtness trackers and smartwatches to estimate blood oxygen levels\
    \ and mon-\nitor pulse rates. The sensor emits light onto the epidermis and measures\
    \ the intensity of the\nlight that is reﬂected, producing a photoplethysmography\
    \ waveform. This waveform can\nprovide insight into various health parameters\
    \ and is frequently employed in applications\nrelated to healthcare and wellness\
    \ [47].\nPPG is a common optical monitoring method used to track heart rate at\
    \ a low cost.\nPPG does not require any incisions. A PPG sensor measures changes\
    \ in blood ﬂow by\nplacing a light source and a photodetector on the skin’s surface.\
    \ The PPG signal has recently\nattracted the attention of several academics interested\
    \ in extracting further data from it [48].\nThe PPG signal’s second derivative\
    \ wave carries crucial diagnostic information. Therefore,\nthis waveform analysis\
    \ can aid in identifying many cardiovascular problems. Placement of\nthe PPG sensor\
    \ on the patient’s ﬁnger, earlobe, or forehead is the norm. Researchers are\n\
    exploring several anatomical zones in search of more convenient measurement points.\n\
    D.\nTemperature sensors\nA temperature sensor is a common medical sensor used\
    \ to measure body temperature\naccurately and safely. It is designed speciﬁcally\
    \ for medical applications to monitor patients’\ntemperature in hospitals, clinics,\
    \ and other healthcare settings. These sensors utilize various\ntechnologies such\
    \ as infrared, thermocouples, or thermistors to detect and convert body\nheat\
    \ into an electrical signal that healthcare professionals can measure and interpret\
    \ [49].\nMedical temperature sensors come in different forms, including oral,\
    \ rectal, ear,\nand forehead, and wearable patches or bands. Each type has its\
    \ own advantages and\nlimitations, and its usage depends on the patient’s age,\
    \ condition, and the healthcare\nprovider’s preference.\nThese sensors are crucial\
    \ in detecting fever, a common sign of many illnesses. Monitor-\ning body temperature,\
    \ accurately, helps healthcare professionals diagnose and monitor the\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7435\n12 of 36\nprogress of diseases or infections. It enables timely\
    \ intervention and appropriate treatment,\nensuring the well-being of patients\
    \ [50].\nE.\nBlood pressure sensors\nBlood pressure sensors measure and monitor\
    \ blood pressure levels by detecting the\npressure exerted by blood ﬂow in the\
    \ arteries. Modern blood pressure sensors often employ\nan oscillometer, which\
    \ measures the pressure changes caused by the pulsatile ﬂow of blood.\nThe sensor\
    \ inﬂates the cuff to restrict blood ﬂow temporarily and then gradually deﬂates\
    \ it\nwhile monitoring the pressure changes. The sensor can determine systolic\
    \ and diastolic\nblood pressure values based on these measurements [51].\nVarious\
    \ types of blood pressure sensors are available, including those designed for\n\
    home use, clinical settings, and wearable devices. Some sensors may connect to\
    \ smart-\nphones or other devices for data storage and analysis. It is always\
    \ a good idea to consult\na healthcare professional for advice on selecting and\
    \ using blood pressure sensors, as\naccurate measurements and proper technique\
    \ are essential for monitoring and managing\nblood pressure effectively. Alternative\
    \ methods use biological sensors such as ECG and\nPPG sensors to estimate blood\
    \ pressure without a cuff [52].\nF.\nEEG sensors\nElectroencephalography (EEG)\
    \ sensors are devices used to detect and record the\nelectrical activity of the\
    \ brain. EEG is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures\nthe voltage\
    \ ﬂuctuations resulting from the ionic current ﬂows within the neurons of the\n\
    brain. These sensors have a wide range of applications, including diagnosing epilepsy,\
    \ sleep\ndisorders, brain injuries, and neurological conditions. They are also\
    \ used in neurofeedback,\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCI), and cognitive research\
    \ [53].\nEEG sensors consist of multiple electrodes that are typically attached\
    \ to the scalp.\nThese electrodes are small metal discs or sensors that come into\
    \ contact with the scalp to\npick up the electrical signals produced by the brain.\
    \ Electrodes are either wet or dry. Wet\nelectrodes require a conductive gel to\
    \ be applied between the electrode and the scalp to\nensure good electrical contact.\
    \ The gel helps to reduce impedance and interference. While\ndry electrodes do\
    \ not require any additional gel and can be directly applied to the scalp [54].\n\
    They are more user-friendly and are commonly used in consumer-grade EEG devices.\
    \ The\nnumber of electrodes used in an EEG system can vary, ranging from a few\
    \ channels to\nseveral hundred, depending on the level of spatial resolution required.\
    \ The positioning of\nEEG electrodes is essential to capture speciﬁc brain activity\
    \ patterns accurately [55].\nMoreover, EEG sensors are connected to ampliﬁers\
    \ that strengthen the weak electrical\nsignals picked up by the electrodes. Ampliﬁers\
    \ play a crucial role in maintaining the signal-\nto-noise ratio, which is critical\
    \ in obtaining high-quality EEG data. The ampliﬁed analog\nsignals are then converted\
    \ to digital signals using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).\nDigital signals\
    \ are easier to process, store, and transmit for further analysis.\nThe EEG system\
    \ includes a signal processing unit that ﬁlters, ampliﬁes, and digitizes\nthe\
    \ raw EEG data. Signal processing techniques are employed to remove artifacts\
    \ and noise\nfrom the signals. Modern EEG systems often have data interfaces,\
    \ e.g., Bluetooth, allowing\nreal-time data streaming and integration with other\
    \ devices or software applications [56].\nG.\nEMG sensors\nElectromyography (EMG)\
    \ sensors detect the electrical activity produced by muscles.\nThese devices are\
    \ commonly used in medical and research ﬁelds to assess muscle function,\ndiagnose\
    \ neuromuscular disorders, and control prosthetic limbs. EMG sensors consist\n\
    of electrodes placed on the skin surface above the muscles of interest. These\
    \ electrodes\npick up the electrical signals generated by muscle contractions.\
    \ When you move a muscle,\nelectrical impulses are sent from your brain through\
    \ your nerves to the targeted muscle\nﬁbers, causing them to contract. The EMG\
    \ sensor detects these electrical signals and\nconverts them into measurable readings\
    \ [57].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n13 of 36\nThere are two types of EMG sensors:\
    \ surface EMG and intramuscular EMG. Surface\nEMG sensors use adhesive electrodes\
    \ placed on the skin, while intramuscular EMG sensors\ninvolve inserting ﬁne needle\
    \ electrodes directly into the muscle [58]. EMG sensors are\nvaluable in various\
    \ applications, including medical diagnostics, sports science, rehabili-\ntation,\
    \ and human-computer interfaces. They enable researchers and clinicians to assess\n\
    muscle function, monitor progress during therapy, and develop innovative technologies\n\
    that interface with the human body [59].\nMedical professionals use EMG sensors\
    \ to keep track of a patient’s nerve and muscle\nproblems. Wearable gadgets that\
    \ monitor a patient’s behavior use such sensors as well.\nIn systems that use\
    \ emotion-based intelligent information sensing, EMG sensors prove\nto be essential.\
    \ There are systems that use EMG signals and other body vital monitoring\nbiomedical\
    \ sensors to evaluate face muscle variability and classify each change with its\n\
    related emotion [60]. Table 4 presents the common market available IoT medical\
    \ sensors.\nAlso, the table introduces the main speciﬁcations of each sensor [61].\n\

    \ in various applications, including medical diagnostics, sports science, reha-\n\
    bilitation, and human-computer interfaces. They enable researchers and clinicians\
    \ to as-\nsess muscle function, monitor progress during therapy, and develop innovative\
    \ technol-\nogies that interface with the human body [59]. \nMedical professionals\

    \ gadgets that monitor a patient’s behavior use such sensors as well. In \nsystems\
    \ that use emotion-based intelligent information sensing, EMG sensors prove to\

    \ Technologies\nWith the recent evolution of wireless technology, several wireless\
    \ communication\ntechnologies have been introduced to wireless medical sensors\
    \ used in Healthcare 4.0\nand IoMT. These heterogeneous interfaces are commonly\
    \ used to enable connectivity and\ndata exchange. The key wireless technologies\
    \ deployed in medical IoT applications are\nintroduced as follows [71–74].\na.\n\
    Bluetooth: Bluetooth technology is widely adopted for connecting medical devices\n\
    and wearables to smartphones, tablets, and other computing devices. It allows\
    \ for\nthe transmission of health data, remote device control, and seamless integration\
    \ with\nmobile health applications.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n15 of 36\nb.\nBluetooth\
    \ Low Energy (BLE): It is a wireless communication technology designed\nto provide\
    \ short-range, low-power connectivity between devices. BLE is a subset of\nthe\
    \ Bluetooth technology standard and is optimized for applications that require\
    \ low\npower consumption and periodic data exchanges. BLE is speciﬁcally designed\
    \ for\nenergy-efﬁcient communication, making it ideal for devices that operate\
    \ on battery\npower. This allows BLE-enabled devices to have long battery life,\
    \ which is essential\nfor applications such as wearables, medical devices, and\
    \ IoT sensors. BLE provides\nshort-range communication typically within a range\
    \ of up to 10 m. This limited\nrange is well-suited for medical applications that\
    \ require local and proximity-based\ninteractions between devices. Compared to\
    \ classic Bluetooth, BLE has a lower data\ntransfer rate. It is suitable for transmitting\
    \ small bursts of data, such as sensor\nreadings, notiﬁcations, or control commands.\n\
    c.\nZigbee: Zigbee is a low-power, short-range wireless technology well-suited\
    \ for\nmedical IoT applications. It is an IEEE 802.15.4-based. Due to its energy\
    \ efﬁciency\nand reliable connectivity, it is often used in remote patient monitoring\
    \ systems, smart\nhome healthcare devices, and hospital equipment monitoring systems.\n\
    d.\nWi-Fi: Wi-Fi is a popular wireless method for establishing a direct internet\
    \ connection.\nIt utilizes the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum frequently. The family\
    \ of IEEE 802.11x\nstandards is referred to as “Wi-Fi.” It achieves a theoretical\
    \ coverage of 20 to 100 m\nindoors. Also, it allows for a maximal transfer rate\
    \ of more than 54 Mbps. In numer-\nous ways, it outperforms many existing communication\
    \ interfaces. Wi-Fi ﬁts well for\naudio and video applications due to its higher\
    \ bandwidth requirements. Deploying\nWi-Fi for IoT applications consumes a lot\
    \ of energy, which is one of its primary dis-\nadvantages. It is not feasible\
    \ for IoT sensors to run on batteries because of their high\npower consumption.\
    \ Additionally, it is especially vulnerable to background inter-\nference and\
    \ channel obstruction. Wi-Fi is, without a doubt, essential for high-speed\nconnections.\
    \ However, it has signiﬁcant limitations and disadvantages in the context\nof\
    \ the IoT, rendering it less popular. Nonetheless, many researchers have proposed\n\
    healthcare systems incorporating Wi-Fi in monitoring patients’ vitals. Wi-Fi provides\n\
    high-speed wireless connectivity over short to medium distances. It is extensively\n\
    used in healthcare settings for connecting medical devices, including wearable\
    \ health\ntrackers, patient monitoring systems, and smart hospital infrastructure.\n\
    e.\nCellular technology: Cellular networks provide wide-area coverage and are\
    \ uti-\nlized for medical IoT applications that require long-range communication,\
    \ such as\ntelemedicine and remote patient monitoring. The evolution of cellular\
    \ networks from\n3G to 5G facilitates higher data rates, lower latency, and improved\
    \ connectivity.\nf.\nLoRaWAN: LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low-power,\
    \ long-range\nwireless technology suitable for medical IoT deployments that span\
    \ large areas, such\nas smart hospitals or smart cities. It enables connectivity\
    \ with low-cost, battery-\noperated devices and supports efﬁcient data transmission\
    \ in scenarios where power\nconsumption is critical.\ng.\n6LoWPAN: It is the IPv6\
    \ transmission over a low-power wireless personal area\nnetwork. It is cheap,\
    \ energy efﬁcient, and easy to tailor to your needs. With these\nfeatures, it\
    \ can be used for various IoT tasks. It supports IPv6 and a variety of IEEE\n\
    802.15.4 protocols for data exchange.\n4. Mian Features and Challenges of IoMT\
    \ and Healthcare 4.0\n4.1. Speciﬁcations and Requirements of IoMT and Healthcare\

    \ providers in stream-\nlining their workﬂows, enhancing communication, and increasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of\npatient care.\nThis new era of telemedicine has many requirements\
    \ that can be summarized as\nfollows [5,77,78].\n1.\nAdvanced data analytics:\
    \ The advanced data analytics capability is crucial to Health-\ncare 4.0. It enables\
    \ the identiﬁcation of anomalies and patterns that can assist in\nproviding enhanced\
    \ personalized care, thereby leading to better patient outcomes.\n2.\nUltra-reliable\
    \ communication: It is a critical aspect of medical data transferred over\nHealthcare\
    \ 4.0, enabling dependable, safe, and operational communication among\nhealthcare\
    \ actors. It ensures that data is communicated without any loss or break-\ndowns,\
    \ providing reliable diagnosis, treatment decisions to physicians, patients, and\n\
    caregivers. Ultra-reliable communication ensures that critical medical data, including\n\
    vital signs, lab results, and medication information, are transmitted accurately\
    \ and\nrapidly to the right recipients. Moreover, it can enable timely communication\
    \ of alarm\nnotiﬁcations, emergency calls, and other urgent messages, which can\
    \ help prevent\nmedical errors and reduce the risk of adverse events. Summing\
    \ up, ultra-reliable com-\nmunications are crucial in improving patient safety\
    \ and clinical outcomes by enabling\nreliable and real-time communication between\
    \ healthcare providers, patients, and\nmedical devices.\n3.\nHigh network availability:\
    \ The high network availability of Healthcare 4.0 data refers\nto the healthcare\
    \ system’s ability to access and utilize data in real-time and without\ninterruption.\
    \ Having a highly available network ensures that healthcare providers\nalways\
    \ have access to patient records, medical images, and other vital data, which\n\
    can save lives in critical situations.\n4.\nInteroperability: Interoperability\
    \ is essential in the Healthcare 4.0 environment. This\nnecessitates that all\
    \ systems and devices communicate with one another, allowing\nfor the sharing\
    \ and analysis of data. Healthcare 4.0 systems signiﬁcantly rely on the\nability\
    \ to share patient data across systems.\n5.\nInformation consent: Patients should\
    \ have control over their health data and how\nit is disseminated, per informed\
    \ consent. Before using patients’ data, healthcare\norganizations must ensure\
    \ that patients are completely informed about how it will be\nutilized and obtain\
    \ their consent.\n6.\nHigh network ﬂexibility: Network ﬂexibility is a key component\
    \ of Healthcare 4.0,\nwhich indicates the ability of healthcare providers to adapt\
    \ their networks quickly and\neasily to changing patient needs and technological\
    \ advancements. This is particularly\nimportant as Healthcare 4.0 involves the\
    \ integration of various technologies, including\nrobotics, AI, the IoT, and big\
    \ data analytics. The ability to add these technologies\nquickly and seamlessly\
    \ to the healthcare network is essential in order to improve\npatient care, productivity,\
    \ and overall healthcare quality.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n17 of 36\n7.\nSecurity\
    \ and privacy: Most countries store and transmit personal health information\n\
    (PHI) electronically. Due to the vast amount of health information gathered and\n\
    shared via the Internet, the key concerns of healthcare operators are privacy\
    \ and\nsecurity. There is a risk of system-wide attacks on health data due to\
    \ the open\ntransmission channel. To defend against such attacks, researchers\
    \ employ a variety of\ncryptographic strategies. Privacy includes the ability\
    \ of only authorized users to access\nhealth information about speciﬁc patients,\
    \ as well as the retrieval, use, and disclosure\nof patient information to an\
    \ interloper. This can be achieved by implementing various\nschemes and their\
    \ corresponding rules.\n4.2. Challenges with IoMT and Healthcare 4.0\nDeveloping\
    \ communication networks for Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT faces many chal-\nlenges.\
    \ In this section, we address these limitations.\nA.\nData privacy and security\n\

    a higher risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive patient information.\n\
    Data privacy and security in Healthcare 4.0 are critical considerations due to\
    \ the increasing\nreliance on technology, data, and interconnected systems. Some\
    \ of the Healthcare 4.0\nprivacy and security challenges are introduced as follows\
    \ [79,80].\na.\nData breaches: The digitization and sharing of vast amounts of\
    \ patient data in-\ncreases the risk of data breaches. Cybercriminals may attempt\
    \ to gain unauthorized\naccess to sensitive health information, leading to identity\
    \ theft, fraud, or other\nmalicious activities.\nb.\nInternal threats: Healthcare\
    \ organizations must also be wary of internal threats.\nEmployees with access\
    \ to patient data may intentionally or unintentionally misuse\nor disclose conﬁdential\
    \ information.\nc.\nInteroperability risks: Integrating various systems, devices,\
    \ and applications can\ncreate vulnerabilities in data exchange, leaving data\
    \ exposed during transmission or\nstorage. Ensuring secure communication and data\
    \ sharing among different platforms\nis crucial.\nd.\nIoT vulnerabilities: The\
    \ growing use of IoMT devices in healthcare presents security\nchallenges. Weaknesses\
    \ in these devices can be exploited, compromising patient data\nand device functionality.\n\
    e.\nLack of standardization: Inconsistencies in security practices and protocols\
    \ across\ndifferent healthcare organizations can lead to weaknesses that attackers\
    \ may exploit.\nThe lack of standardized security measures can hinder overall\
    \ system security.\nf.\nRansomware attacks: Healthcare facilities have increasingly\
    \ become targets of ran-\nsomware attacks where hackers encrypt patient data,\
    \ making it inaccessible until a\nransom is paid. Such attacks can disrupt patient\
    \ care and compromise data integrity.\ng.\nInadequate security measures: Some\
    \ healthcare providers may not implement robust\nsecurity measures due to cost\
    \ constraints or lack of awareness. Insufﬁcient security\nmeasures can expose\
    \ data to potential breaches.\nh.\nData sharing with third parties: Healthcare\

    \ can reduce the strain on\ncentralized networks by processing data closer to\
    \ the source, thereby decreasing the\nvolume of data that needs to be transferred\
    \ over the network.\n•\nData compression: Implementing data compression techniques\
    \ can help reduce data\nsize, easing the burden on the network and improving efﬁciency.\n\
    •\nLoad balancing: Load balancing techniques distribute network trafﬁc across\
    \ multiple\nservers or resources, preventing congestion and ensuring even data\
    \ distribution.\n•\nBandwidth monitoring and management: Continuous monitoring\
    \ of network band-\nwidth usage helps identify bottlenecks and allows for proactive\
    \ capacity planning and\nmanagement. Also, applying AI-based methods at the core\
    \ of the network can assist\nbandwidth management.\nC.\nEnergy\nEnergy in healthcare\
    \ systems and devices encompasses several issues related to power\nsupply, energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and sustainability. These challenges are critical in Healthcare 4.0,\n\
    which relies heavily on energy-limited devices, i.e., IoMT. Table 5 presents the\
    \ key energy\nchallenges with Healthcare 4.0 [5,18].\nSome potential solutions\
    \ to overcome such challenges include the following [5,18]:\n-\nEnergy-efﬁcient\

    deliver services with very minimal downtime or disruptions. It emphasizes the\
    \ network’s ability to\nremain operational and accessible to users and applications\
    \ for an extended period. This is an\nimportant issue with medical services due\
    \ to the emergency of most medical services.\nHigh scalability\nScalability is\
    \ a critical issue with Healthcare 4.0 due to the evolution and growth of medical\
    \ devices\nand technologies. 5G communications can signiﬁcantly increase the scalability\
    \ of Healthcare 4.0 by\nenabling seamless integration and expansion of advanced\
    \ technologies and healthcare services.\nIntegration with the\nInternet infrastructure\n\
    5G communications can assist in integrating medical sensors into the Internet\
    \ and supporting remote\nservices via a 5G cellular interface. Many remote Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 applications have problems with the\nappropriate communication interface\
    \ between devices and the Internet. These problems can be\nsolved using 5G communications.\n\
    Extended coverage\nBy utilizing 5G technology, healthcare providers can extend\
    \ their reach to remote and\nunderserved areas.\nData security and privacy\nThe\
    \ implementation of 5G prioritizes robust security measures to protect patient\
    \ privacy and prevent\ndata breaches.\nTo better introduce the beneﬁts of 5G communications\
    \ to Healthcare 4.0, we consider\nthe following use case [85–87]:\n-\nTelemedicine\
    \ services: 5G can revolutionize telemedicine by enabling high-quality\nvideo\
    \ conferencing and real-time collaboration between healthcare professionals. The\n\
    low latency and stable connections can offer a more immersive and interactive\
    \ virtual\nhealthcare experience, leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and\
    \ follow-up care.\n-\nRemote surgeries and robotic-assisted operations: 5G’s ultra-reliable\
    \ and low-latency\ncommunications can enable remote surgeries and robotic-assisted\
    \ procedures. Sur-\ngeons can perform complex operations from a remote location\
    \ using high-resolution\nvideo feeds and haptic feedback. This can bridge the\
    \ gap between medical expertise\nand underserved areas, where access to specialized\
    \ healthcare is limited.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n22 of 36\n-\nPrecision medicine\
    \ services: 5G empowers precision medicine initiatives by enabling\nfast and reliable\
    \ transmission of large genomic datasets, facilitating quicker anal-\nysis and\

    \ and clinicians for faster advancements in precision medicine.\n-\nAugmented\
    \ and virtual reality (AR/VR) services: 5G can power immersive AR/VR\napplications\
    \ in healthcare. This technology can be used for medical training, patient\neducation,\
    \ pain management, and even remote collaborative surgeries, fostering better\n\
    outcomes and experiences for both patients and healthcare professionals.\nThe\
    \ 5G communications have the potential to signiﬁcantly improve Healthcare 4.0;\n\
    however, there are several challenges and limitations to implementing 5G communications\n\
    in Healthcare 4.0. systems. These limitations are summarized in Table 9 [84,85].\n\
    Table 9. Limitations of 5G communications in Healthcare 4.0.\nImplication\nIssue\
    \ with Healthcare 4.0\nInterference\nThe high-frequency spectrum used by 5G can\
    \ be susceptible to interference from physical objects,\nsuch as walls or medical\
    \ equipment. Ensuring reliable coverage and minimizing potential signal\ndisruptions\
    \ is crucial.\nCost\nThe deployment of 5G networks and associated hardware can\
    \ be expensive. Healthcare\norganizations need to assess the cost implications\
    \ and potential return on investment when\nconsidering 5G implementation.\nInfrastructure\n\
    5G networks rely on a dense infrastructure of small cells and base stations. Implementing\
    \ this\ninfrastructure within healthcare facilities may require signiﬁcant infrastructure\
    \ upgrades.\nRegulatory\nThe implementation of 5G in healthcare may involve compliance\
    \ with speciﬁc regulations governing\ndata privacy, patient consent, and network\
    \ safety. Adhering to these regulations is essential to avoid\nlegal and ethical\
    \ issues.\nPublic fears and beliefs\nWhile 5G technology offers numerous beneﬁts,\
    \ some people have expressed concerns and fears about\nits deployment, especially\
    \ in medical services. One of the primary fears revolves around potential\nhealth\
    \ risks associated with increased exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Some\
    \ individuals worry\nthat the higher frequency and intensity of 5G signals might\
    \ have adverse effects on human health. It\nis essential to address these fears\
    \ through rigorous scientiﬁc research, transparent communication,\nand robust\
    \ regulatory measures.\n5.2. AI\nAI plays a critical role as a key enabling technology\
    \ in the context of Healthcare\n4.0 since it can revolutionize various aspects\
    \ of healthcare. For medical imaging, AI-\npowered algorithms can analyze medical\
    \ images, such as X-rays, computerized tomography\n(CT) scans, and magnetic resonance\
    \ imaging (MRI), to detect abnormalities and assist\nradiologists in making accurate\
    \ diagnoses [88].\nAI systems can analyze vast amounts of patient data, including\
    \ medical records,\nsymptoms, and genetic information, to provide faster and more\
    \ accurate disease diagnoses,\nimproving patient outcomes. Drug discovery is another\
    \ ﬁeld in which AI can assist. AI\nalgorithms can rapidly analyze large databases\
    \ of pharmaceutical compounds and predict\ntheir efﬁcacy, helping researchers\
    \ identify potential drug candidates faster and reduce the\ntime required for\
    \ clinical trials.\nAI algorithms can also assist personalized medicine services\
    \ by analyzing genetic\ndata and patient records to develop personalized treatment\
    \ plans, considering individual\nvariations, and optimizing healthcare interventions.\
    \ Moreover, AI can power remote\nmonitoring services by allowing remote healthcare\
    \ providers to detect changes or anomalies\nand provide timely interventions.\
    \ AI chatbots and virtual assistants can provide basic\nhealthcare information,\
    \ answer patient queries, and offer support, enhancing patient\nengagement and\
    \ accessibility to healthcare services. Another important aspect is the\ndisease\
    \ prediction that AI solutions can accomplish [89].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n\
    23 of 36\nTelesurgery is another domain that has to make use of AI. To achieve\
    \ the required\nlatency and quality of experience (QoE) required by telesurgery\
    \ applications. AI will be\nused to build model mediation algorithms and edge\
    \ intelligence computing to enable\nreal-time communication required for telesurgery\
    \ applications [90].\nThe integration of AI in Healthcare 4.0 has the potential\
    \ to transform healthcare\ndelivery, enhance diagnostics, and improve patient\
    \ care by leveraging the power of machine\nlearning, natural language processing,\
    \ and advanced analytics.\n5.3. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing provides the\
    \ storage, management, and processing of healthcare\ndata and applications on\
    \ remote servers accessed via the Internet. It offers various beneﬁts\nfor medical\
    \ professionals and the healthcare industry. Cloud computing in healthcare\npromotes\
    \ efﬁcient data management, collaboration, remote access, and cost optimization\n\
    for medical professionals, thereby improving patient care and streamlining healthcare\n\
    processes. It achieves various beneﬁts and functionalities to Healthcare 4.0 and\
    \ IoMT,\nsummarized in Table 10 [91,92].\nTable 10. Beneﬁts of cloud computing\
    \ to Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\nBeneﬁt\nHow It Assists Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT\n\

    \ securely store and access patient data from\nanywhere, anytime, using any internet-connected\
    \ device.\n•\nThis streamlines data management eliminates physical storage constraints\
    \ and facilitates\nefﬁcient collaboration among healthcare providers.\nScalability\n\
    •\nCloud platforms can scale computing resources based on demand. This is particularly\
    \ beneﬁcial\nfor medical professionals dealing with data-intensive processes or\
    \ situations requiring rapid\nscaling, including during emergencies.\nData backup\n\
    •\nCloud services typically offer robust backup and recovery capabilities, ensuring\
    \ data resilience\nand minimizing the risk of data loss in case of local system\
    \ failures or natural disasters.\n•\nThis feature is vital to save patient information\
    \ and maintain continuity of care.\nEnhanced collaboration\n•\nCloud computing\
    \ enables real-time collaboration between medical professionals, allowing them\n\
    to securely share patient records, test results, and treatment plans.\n•\nIt also\
    \ supports telemedicine by providing a platform for remote consultations, remote\n\
    monitoring, and virtual patient care.\nCost-effectiveness\n•\nCloud computing\
    \ eliminates the need for extensive on-premises infrastructure, IT hardware,\n\
    and maintenance costs.\n•\nIt offers a cost-efﬁcient business model, allowing\
    \ medical professionals to scale resources as\nneeded, optimizing cost-efﬁciency.\n\
    Security and compliance\n•\nCloud providers invest heavily in advanced security\
    \ measures, encryption techniques, and\nregulatory compliance standards.\n•\n\
    By leveraging cloud services, medical professionals can beneﬁt from robust security\
    \ protocols\nand ensure adherence to healthcare privacy regulations.\n5.4. Distributed\
    \ Edge Computing\nDistributed edge computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure\
    \ that brings\ncomputational power and data storage closer to the edge of a network,\
    \ typically near the\nsource of data generation. It aims to reduce latency, enhance\
    \ real-time processing, improve\nbandwidth utilization, and enhance security and\
    \ privacy. The utilization of computing\nresources locally at the edge of the\
    \ network, e.g., near the medical devices, to process\nand analyze data generated\
    \ by IoMT devices plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare\nsystems [93].\n\
    This approach offers several beneﬁts, including reduced latency, improved reliability,\n\
    and enhanced data privacy and security. By deploying edge computing in Healthcare\
    \ 4.0\nand IoMT, medical data can be processed locally, minimizing the need for\
    \ sending sensitive\npatient information to a central location. Edge nodes can\
    \ perform real-time data analytics,\nsupport remote monitoring, facilitate faster\
    \ response times, and enable autonomous medical\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n24 of\
    \ 36\ndevice operations. However, speciﬁc deployment strategies and implementations\
    \ vary\nacross different companies and organizations. Factors such as network\
    \ architecture, device\ncapabilities, data processing requirements, and regulatory\
    \ considerations inﬂuence how\ndistributed edge computing is implemented in the\
    \ IoMT [94].\nDeploying distributed edge computing, e.g., fog computing and mobile\
    \ edge com-\nputing (MEC), for Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT can introduce the beneﬁts\
    \ introduced in\nTable 11 [93–95].\nTable 11. Beneﬁts of distributed edge computing\
    \ to Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\nBeneﬁt\nHow It Assists Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT\n\
    Reducing latency\n•\nProcessing data at the edge, near the patient or device,\
    \ minimizes the time it takes for data to\ntravel to a central location.\n•\n\
    This reduced latency is critical for real-time health monitoring, emergency responses,\
    \ and critical\ncare scenarios.\nEnhanced privacy\nand security\n•\nWith distributed\
    \ edge computing, sensitive healthcare data can be processed locally, reducing\
    \ the\nneed for transmitting it over the Internet or to centralized servers.\n\
    •\nThis approach improves data privacy and security, minimizing the chances of\
    \ unauthorized\naccess or data breaches.\nBandwidth optimization\n•\nHealthcare\
    \ 4.0 and IoMT generate massive amounts of data, which can strain network bandwidth\n\
    if transmitted to the cloud for processing.\n•\nBy leveraging distributed edge\
    \ computing, data can be processed, ﬁltered, and aggregated at the\nedge, minimizing\
    \ the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network. This\noptimization\
    \ improves overall network efﬁciency.\nReliable connectivity\n•\nIn healthcare,\
    \ consistent data connectivity is vital. The ultimate connectivity requirements\
    \ of\nHealthcare 4.0 and IoMT can be assisted by distributed computing.\n•\nEdge\
    \ computing allows IoMT devices to continue functioning even during intermittent\
    \ or\nunstable network connections. By storing critical data locally, healthcare\
    \ systems can continue to\noperate even if the network goes down temporarily.\n\
    Real-time analytics and\ndecision-making\n•\nTime-sensitive healthcare applications\
    \ depend on real-time data analysis and prompt\ndecision-making. Distributed edge\
    \ computing enables data processing locally, facilitating instant\ninsights and\
    \ reducing response times.\n•\nThis is essential for monitoring patient vitals,\
    \ detecting anomalies, and triggering\ntimely interventions.\nCost efﬁciency\n\
    •\nOfﬂoading computation and storage to local edge servers can reduce the need\
    \ for expensive cloud\ninfrastructure and bandwidth.\n•\nAlso, it simpliﬁes the\
    \ requirements of the core network. This can lower operational costs\nassociated\
    \ with data transmission and storage, making healthcare services more affordable.\n\
    Ofﬂine assistance\n•\nIn some healthcare scenarios, network connectivity may not\
    \ always be reliable or available.\nDistributed edge computing allows health systems\
    \ to function ofﬂine or with intermittent\nconnectivity by processing data locally.\n\
    •\nThis ensures uninterrupted patient care and data collection even in challenging\
    \ network conditions.\n5.5. Blockchain\nBlockchain is a promising technology that\
    \ can assist Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT applica-\ntions in various ways. It can offer\
    \ robust solutions to address data security, interoperability,\ntransparency,\
    \ and patient control challenges. These are critical issues with Healthcare 4.0\n\
    and IoMT systems [96]. This ultimately improves the efﬁcacy and reliability of\
    \ healthcare\nsystems. Blockchain can assist Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT systems as\
    \ follows [96–98].\n1.\nData security and integrity: Blockchain provides a transparent\
    \ and immutable ledger\nwhere data transactions can be securely recorded. It utilizes\
    \ cryptographic algorithms\nto create a tamper-proof and transparent record of\
    \ all transactions or changes made to\nthe data. Once a block is added to the\
    \ chain, it cannot be altered without consensus\namong the network participants.\
    \ This ensures that patient data remains unchanged\nand maintains its integrity.\
    \ Blockchain ensures the integrity and authenticity of\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n\
    25 of 36\nmedical data IoMT devices generate, reducing the risk of tampering or\
    \ unauthorized\naccess. This strengthens data security and privacy, which is critical\
    \ in healthcare.\n2.\nInteroperability and standardization: IoMT devices often\
    \ come from different manu-\nfacturers and use various data formats and protocols.\
    \ A decentralized and standard-\nized framework can be established with blockchain,\
    \ allowing seamless data exchange\nand interoperability between different IoMT\
    \ devices. This promotes collaboration,\nefﬁciency, and better patient care.\n\
    3.\nDecentralization: By leveraging distributed ledger technology, blockchain\
    \ elimi-\nnates the need for a central authority to govern data transactions.\
    \ This can en-\nhance trust among stakeholders within the IoMT ecosystem, such\
    \ as patients, health-\ncare providers, insurers, and regulators. The decentralized\
    \ nature of blockchain\nensures that no single entity controls the stored data,\
    \ reducing the potential for abuse\nor manipulation.\n4.\nData control and consent\
    \ management: Patients can have greater control over their\nhealth data through\
    \ blockchain. They can grant or revoke access permissions to their\nmedical records,\
    \ ensuring data privacy and enabling consent-based data sharing.\nThis empowers\
    \ patients to have a say in how their data is used, fostering trust\nand transparency.\n\
    5.\nData sharing: Smart contracts are self-executing agreements embedded in the\
    \ blockchain\nthat can be used to deﬁne access rights and data-sharing permissions.\
    \ These contracts\ncan automate consent management, ensuring that data is only\
    \ shared with autho-\nrized entities or for speciﬁc purposes. It eliminates the\
    \ need for intermediaries and\nstrengthens data privacy.\n6.\nPatient-centricity:\
    \ Patients can have greater control over their healthcare information\nthrough\
    \ blockchain. Patients can grant speciﬁc healthcare providers or researchers\n\
    permission to access their data, enhancing patient privacy and consent management.\n\
    7.\nSupply chain integrity: In the healthcare industry, blockchain can improve\
    \ the trace-\nability and transparency of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and\
    \ supplies. It enables\nthe veriﬁcation of the entire supply chain journey, ensuring\
    \ authenticity, reducing\ncounterfeit products, and improving patient safety.\n\
    However, deploying a blockchain in Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT faces many challenges.\n\
    Some of these include the scalability of the blockchain network to handle a massive\
    \ amount\nof medical device data, ensuring data privacy compliance, addressing\
    \ regulatory concerns,\nand establishing standardized protocols for data exchange.\
    \ Considering these challenges\nand potential beneﬁts, designing, and implementing\
    \ blockchain solutions in the healthcare\nsector is essential.\n5.6. Device-to-Device\
    \ (D2D) Communications\nD2D communication allows devices within range of each\
    \ other to make direct contact.\nD2D communication can increase network spectrum\
    \ efﬁciency, energy economy, trans-\nmission latency, trafﬁc ofﬂoading, and core\
    \ network congestion relief [99]. It can assist\nHealthcare 4.0 by enabling direct\
    \ communication between nearby devices without the need\nfor central network infrastructure.\n\
    5.7. Related Work\nThere are many proposals that consider developing robust Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 systems.\nSuch works are built based on previously introduced technologies.\
    \ In this sub-section, we\nintroduce the relevant works, and Table 12 summarizes\
    \ the main features and the used key\ntechnologies for the recently developed\
    \ Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT.\nIn [100], the authors developed a healthcare model\
    \ based on ML for early and accurate\nprediction of different diseases. They used\
    \ seven ML classiﬁcation models, including\nsupport vector machine, neural network,\
    \ decision tree, random forest (RF), naive algorithm,\nK-near neighbor, and adaptive\
    \ reinforcement, to make predictions for nine deadly diseases,\nsuch as breast\
    \ cancer, thyroid, and dermatology. The authors used sensitivity, the area under\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7435\n26 of 36\nthe curve, accuracy, and speciﬁcity as four\
    \ measures of performance to evaluate the pro-\nposed model. The classiﬁer has\
    \ a maximum accuracy of 97.62 percent, a sensitivity of 99.67\npercent, a speciﬁcity\
    \ of 97.81 percent, and an area under the ROC curve of 99.32 percent.\nDoctors\
    \ can detect the conditions early because of this new healthcare approach.\nTable\

    \ of a dynamic cyber security architec-\nture for protecting healthcare IoT infrastructure.\
    \ They simulated the framework using\nevolutionary game theory and evaluated it.\
    \ The simulation ﬁndings showed the defense’s\noptimal response to dynamic and\
    \ adaptive foes. The authors suggested taking quantitative\nmeasurements for future\
    \ work. Also, they suggested designing game simulations to fully\nunderstand and\
    \ predict the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive assault and defense utilizing\n\
    ML and evolutionary game theory.\nIn [102], the authors examined how medical big\
    \ data and wearable IoT healthcare\nsystems may be used to remotely monitor and\
    \ care for COVID-19 patients who had been\nconﬁrmed or suspected. They used information\
    \ gathered from many sectors, including\nAccenture, Amwell, Deloitte, Ericsson\
    \ ConsumerLab, Kyruus, Rockefeller Foundation,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n27 of\
    \ 36\nSyneos Health, and USAID, to conduct analyses and make estimates about the\
    \ use of\nAI-driven biosensors in diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention during\
    \ the COVID-19\npandemic. COVID-19 prevention, screening, and treatment have all\
    \ beneﬁtted from AI-\npowered diagnostic technologies.\nIn [103], the authors\
    \ built an e-health model with multiple patient agent software in-\nstances with\
    \ three layers: sensing, close processing, and remote processing. They described\n\
    a possible 5G device conﬁguration for the patient agent. The dedicated patient\
    \ agent app\ncould control the resources of individual 5G network slices. An investigation\
    \ of the new\ne-health app’s performance indicated that it would use blockchain\
    \ technology to handle\nhealth data in near-real time.\nThe research in [104]\
    \ provided a road map for introducing IoT and AI into healthcare.\nThe study investigates\
    \ the future of healthcare and how AI would be combined with sensor-\nenabled\
    \ IoT-based medical equipment. The groundwork, for future healthcare services,\
    \ has\nbeen laid through a review of the literature on AI, ML, utilizing smart\
    \ systems, and IoT in\nhealthcare. The authors explained how a network of medical\
    \ professionals might remotely\nmonitor patients using wearables supported by\
    \ the IoT and AI. The research stated that\nseamless integration between patients,\
    \ doctors, and other healthcare professionals allows\nfor timely, convenient healthcare\
    \ delivery. The authors investigated how future smart\nhealthcare technologies\
    \ can facilitate cooperation amongst network partners in delivering\ncontinuous\
    \ patient monitoring and care. A comprehensive framework was provided that\naids\
    \ medical professionals in delivering top-notch treatment to their patients. However,\n\
    the study focused on the medical ﬁeld.\nIn [105], the authors proposed a fog-computing\
    \ architecture for processing sensor data\nthat makes efﬁcient use of shared resources.\
    \ The model was built using publish/subscribe\nand distributed hash tables (DHT).\
    \ The authors recommended architecture for efﬁcient\nsharing and use of resources.\
    \ The issues with processing data in the cloud have been\nﬁxed by introducing\
    \ fog computing to Healthcare 4.0. Publish/subscribe and peer-to-peer\n(P2P) overlays\
    \ are used in the proposed framework to satisfy the requirement for fast\nnode\
    \ discovery.\nEnd-to-end security solutions are necessary to prevent and regulate\
    \ health data\nbreaches because of the sensitive nature of this data. Several\
    \ authentication and autho-\nrization systems can protect private information\
    \ gathered by IoT devices in Healthcare 4.0.\nThe transport layer security (TLS)\
    \ protocol aims to make information transmission more\nsecure. Using this protocol,\
    \ a user can avoid the issue of communications getting lost or\nswitched around.\n\
    A tricky ﬂaw in the datagram transport layer security (DTLS) protocol is that\
    \ an\nattacker might ﬂood a server with ClientHello messages. With each new ClientHello\n\
    message, the denial-of-service (DoS) attacker can gain more bandwidth and resources\
    \ by\nestablishing a new connection to the server. The authors in [106] developed\
    \ an intelligent\ngateway-based authentication and authorization model to solve\
    \ these issues. The proposed\nmodel keeps attackers and malicious users from accessing\
    \ important physiological data.\nThe authors used the Contiki Network Simulator\
    \ to demonstrate the improved DTLS based\non smart gateways. The packet loss ratio\
    \ was used as a performance measure for the\nintroduced work. The enhanced DTLS’s\
    \ efﬁcacy was evaluated by timing data transfers\nand handshakes.\nThe meaning\
    \ of fog computing in the context of Healthcare 4.0 was examined in [107].\nFog\
    \ computing has proven to be a successful answer to various healthcare concerns.\
    \ The\nresearch used a framework that compared various healthcare technologies\
    \ against present\ntechnology. Issues and challenges in healthcare have been examined,\
    \ as well as health-\nrelated technologies. Fog computing has been regarded as\
    \ a well-designed data processing\nsolution that combines the beneﬁts of the cloud.\
    \ The work included case studies from rural\nlocations, including ECG monitoring\
    \ and diabetes management.\nIn [108], the authors introduced an AI-driven decentralized\
    \ healthcare system that\ncan access and verify IoT devices while guaranteeing\
    \ PHR’s integrity and openness. The\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n28 of 36\nmethod\

    \ on trustworthy AI utilizing the proposed framework could be carried out\nin\
    \ the future.\nIn [109], the authors focused on the problems facing the healthcare\
    \ system. They\nproposed a system architecture and an algorithm for access control\
    \ policies for participants\nin the EHR system to ensure the conﬁdentiality and\
    \ security of patient information. A\nblockchain-based EHR sharing solution was\
    \ also described. The suggested work eliminates\nthe system’s single point of\
    \ failure and central authority. Immutable ledger technology\nensured system security\
    \ by preventing users from altering the ledger. By adjusting pa-\nrameters, including\
    \ block size, block formation time, endorsement policy, and suggested\noptimization,\
    \ for evaluating metrics, such as latency, throughput, and network security,\n\
    the caliper was used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed\n\
    system’s performance was increased by 1.75 times, and its latency was reduced\
    \ by 1.5 times\nby optimizing the performance. This demonstrates the blockchain’s\
    \ utility and importance\nin a variety of ﬁelds, demonstrating that it has the\
    \ potential to be the next revolutionary\ntechnology to replace present healthcare\
    \ systems.\nIn [110], the authors suggested a novel strategy that used Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 to defend\nagainst central authority failure and implement a decentralized\
    \ approach. The performance\nof the overall system and sub-systems were improved\
    \ using a simulation-optimization\ntechnique. The suggested method was tested,\
    \ conﬁrmed, and validated using simulation\nand implementation. In order to evaluate\
    \ the performance of the system and its dependent\nand independent variables,\
    \ several parameters were used in simulation and implementa-\ntion. The error\
    \ in the implementation and simulation results varied from a minimum of\n0.55\
    \ to a maximum of 4.24 due to variations in the environment and simulator limitations.\n\
    This comparison analysis supported the validity of the proposed approach. The\
    \ authors\nsuggested expanding the work in the future to be implemented on various\
    \ blockchain\nnetworks using various tools and techniques. In addition, there\
    \ will be a comparison of\ncurrent and future approaches.\n6. Research Directions\n\
    The following research directions can assist the evolution of Healthcare 4.0 and\
    \ IoMT.\nThese research directions aim to address challenges, improve healthcare\
    \ delivery, enhance\npatient outcomes, and maximize the beneﬁts of IoMT and Healthcare\
    \ 4.0.\n(a)\nEmphasis on medical data analysis and management: There is great\
    \ demand for\ndeveloping robust data management strategies to handle the vast\
    \ amount of data\nIoMT devices generate. This includes ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy and us-\ning advanced analytics tools to derive valuable insights\
    \ from the data. With the\nmassive amount of data generated by IoMT devices, there\
    \ is a need for advanced\ndata analytics techniques and AI algorithms to extract\
    \ meaningful insights. The\nresearch aims to develop predictive models, machine\
    \ learning algorithms, and AI-\ndriven decision support systems to improve patient\
    \ outcomes, disease prevention,\nand healthcare operations.\n(b)\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy improvement: As healthcare systems become increasingly con-\nnected,\
    \ ensuring the security and privacy of medical data is crucial. Research focuses\n\
    on developing robust security measures, encryption techniques, and protocols to\n\
    protect patient information and prevent unauthorized access. Data security is\
    \ a pri-\nmary concern for medical data due to the sensitivity of medical records.\
    \ Encryption,\nsecure networks, and access controls can help protect data from\
    \ unauthorized access.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n29 of 36\nRegular security audits\
    \ and ﬁrmware updates are crucial in maintaining a secure\nenvironment. Researchers\
    \ are interested in deploying decentralized schemes, e.g.,\nblockchain, to assist\
    \ medical data security. Also, lightweight security algorithms\nare a new direction\
    \ to meet the energy requirements of medical sensors. With the\nvast amount of\
    \ personal health data being collected, there is a risk of unauthorized\nsharing\
    \ or use of this information. Implementing strong privacy policies, acquiring\n\
    informed consent, and applying data anonymization techniques can help protect\n\
    patient privacy. It is important to ensure compliance with relevant data protection\
    \ reg-\nulations. Trust management techniques are a promising way introduced for\
    \ achieving\nthese requirements.\n(c)\nInteroperability: IoMT devices and systems\
    \ often come from different manufacturers\nand may use proprietary protocols,\
    \ leading to interoperability challenges. Research\nfocuses on developing standardized\
    \ frameworks and protocols to ensure seamless\ncommunication, data exchange, and\
    \ integration of IoMT devices and systems across\nhealthcare settings.\n(d)\n\
    Edge computing solutions: IoMT generates a large volume of real-time data, which\n\
    can be challenging to transmit and process in traditional cloud-based architectures.\n\
    Researchers have been investigating the deployment of mobile edge computing and\n\
    fog computing techniques to assist IoMT and Healthcare 4.0. This includes developing\n\
    network structures based on edge units, proposing edge intelligence schemes to\
    \ assist\nmedical data, and developing ofﬂoading schemes that meet network requirements.\n\
    (e)\nQuality of experience improvement: Understanding the user experience, acceptance,\n\
    and adoption of IoMT devices among healthcare professionals and patients is crucial.\n\
    The research investigates usability, user interface design, and human factors\
    \ consid-\nerations to ensure that IoMT technologies are user-friendly, efﬁcient,\
    \ and meet the\nneeds of healthcare stakeholders.\n(f)\nEthical and legal considerations:\
    \ There are ethical and legal implications for pa-\ntient privacy, data ownership,\
    \ consent, and accountability. Research explores the\nethical and legal frameworks,\
    \ guidelines, and policies necessary to govern the use\nof IoMT in healthcare\
    \ settings, ensuring transparency, fairness, and adherence to\nethical principles.\n\
    7. Ethical Implications of Healthcare 4.0\nHealthcare 4.0 presents exciting opportunities\
    \ for improving healthcare delivery, but\nit also raises ethical concerns related\
    \ to discrimination, data privacy, and job displacement.\nIt is crucial for stakeholders\
    \ in the healthcare industry, including healthcare providers,\npolicymakers, and\
    \ technology developers, to collaborate and implement ethical frameworks\nthat\
    \ prioritize patient welfare, privacy, and fair access to healthcare services.\
    \ By addressing\nthese ethical implications proactively, the beneﬁts of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 can be maximized while\nits potential drawbacks can be minimized.\nA.\n\
    Potential for discrimination against certain groups of people:\nHealthcare 4.0\
    \ relies heavily on digital technologies that raise concerns about the fair\n\
    and equitable treatment of individuals. The following are some key concerns:\n\
    1.\nData and algorithmic biasing: If the data used to train algorithms is biased\
    \ or in-\ncomplete, the AI systems may make decisions that perpetuate existing\
    \ healthcare\ndisparities. For instance, if historical data disproportionately\
    \ represents certain groups,\nthe AI might provide less accurate or inadequate\
    \ diagnoses and treatments for other\nunderrepresented groups. Thus, if certain\
    \ groups of people are underrepresented in\nthe training data used to develop\
    \ AI algorithms, the algorithms might not perform as\naccurately for those groups.\
    \ This could lead to biased treatment recommendations\nor misdiagnoses [114].\
    \ In addition, if access to healthcare technologies or AI-based\nservices is restricted\
    \ based on socioeconomic status or geographic location, this could\nexacerbate\
    \ existing healthcare disparities.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n30 of 36\n2.\nPrivacy\
    \ and consent: As digital technologies collect vast amounts of personal health\n\
    data; individuals’ privacy becomes a major concern. Healthcare 4.0 should address\n\
    many privacy and consent issues. Mitigating privacy risks and ensuring secure\
    \ data\nmanagement in Healthcare 4.0 systems can be achieved in several ways,\
    \ as presented\nin Table 13. However, Table 14 presents the potential ways to\
    \ ensure proper patient\nconsent [115,116].\n3.\nHealth insurance discrimination:\
    \ Health data could potentially be used by insurance\ncompanies to assess risk\
    \ proﬁles and adjust premiums accordingly, disadvantaging\nindividuals with speciﬁc\
    \ health conditions or genetic predispositions.\nB.\nMisuse of personal health\
    \ data\nHealthcare 4.0 signiﬁcantly increases the risk of personal health data\
    \ being misused\nor mishandled. The full digitization of healthcare 4.0 systems\
    \ increases the number of\ncyber criminals. Medical data will be targeted for\
    \ malicious purposes. Moreover, the\ncommodiﬁcation of health data could lead\
    \ to scenarios where private companies proﬁt from\nselling or using patients’\
    \ health information for marketing or research purposes without\nadequate consent.\
    \ To address these ethical implications, healthcare organizations and\npolicymakers\
    \ must prioritize cybersecurity measures to protect patient data from breaches\n\
    and unauthorized access. There should be stringent regulations in place governing\
    \ the use\nof personal health data, ensuring that data is only used for legitimate\
    \ purposes and with\nexplicit patient consent [117].\nC.\nJob loss of healthcare\
    \ workers\nThe integration of digital technologies in Healthcare 4.0 will lead\
    \ to the automation of\nmany tasks, which raises concerns about potential job\
    \ displacement for healthcare workers.\nHealthcare institutions should focus on\
    \ workforce planning and invest in upskilling and\nreskilling programs for employees\
    \ to mitigate this impact. Moreover, policymakers can\nimplement regulations that\
    \ balance automation with maintaining high-quality patient care,\nensuring that\
    \ technology complements human capabilities rather than replacing them\nentirely\
    \ [118].\nTable 13. Potential solutions to achieve privacy issues in Healthcare\
    \ 4.0.\nIssue\nPotential Solution\nImplement strong access controls\nStrict user\
    \ authentication mechanisms, e.g., multi-factor authentication, should be\nenforced\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive healthcare data.\nEncrypt sensitive\
    \ data\nRobust encryption algorithms to encrypt data and save patient information\
    \ from\nbeing accessed or manipulated by unauthorized individuals.\nRegularly\
    \ update and patch systems\nKeeping software, operating systems, and network infrastructure\
    \ up to date with\nthe latest security patches.\nConduct thorough risk assessments\n\
    Regularly assess the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the data management\n\
    systems. This includes identifying potential threats, analyzing their impact,\
    \ and\naddressing any identiﬁed risks through appropriate mitigation measures.\n\
    Follow regulatory frameworks and\ncompliance standards\nFollowing regulations,\
    \ e.g., HIPAA and GDPR, ensure data handling in a legally\ncompliant and secure\
    \ manner.\nImplement data anonymization techniques\nHealth data can be de-identiﬁed\
    \ or anonymized to minimize the risk of\nre-identifying individuals.\nMonitor\
    \ and detect security incidents\nImplement robust intrusion detection systems\
    \ and security monitoring tools to\ndetect and respond to any unauthorized access\
    \ or suspicious activities.\nEstablish data breach response plans\nPreparing and\
    \ testing an incident response plan can minimize the impact of a data\nbreach\
    \ or security incident. This plan should outline steps to be taken,\ncommunication\
    \ protocols, and strategies for containment and recovery.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7435\n\
    31 of 36\nTable 14. Potential solutions to ensure data consent in Healthcare 4.0.\n\
    Issue\nPotential Solution\nDigital consent forms\nImplementing digital consent\
    \ forms that patients can read and sign electronically is a vital\nsolution. These\
    \ forms should clearly explain the purpose, risks, and beneﬁts of the proposed\n\
    treatment or procedure, allowing patients to make informed decisions. The system\
    \ can then\nstore and record these consents securely.\nTwo-factor authentication\n\
    Using two-factor authentication methods, such as biometrics or unique codes sent\
    \ to the\npatient’s mobile device, to verify the identity of the patient before\
    \ consenting to any\nprocedure ensures that only authorized individuals can provide\
    \ consent.\nConsent management\nsystems (CMS)\nImplementing CMS allows healthcare\
    \ providers to track and manage patient consent\nthroughout the care continuum.\
    \ CMS automate consent processes, track consent status, and\nensure compliance\
    \ with legal and regulatory requirements.\nAudit trails\nMaintaining robust audit\
    \ trails that record all consent-related activities, including when\nconsent was\
    \ obtained, who obtained it, and any subsequent updates or withdrawals of\nconsent,\
    \ helps establish a transparent record of patient consent.\nEducation and communication\n\
    Ensuring patients are educated about their rights and the importance of informed\
    \ consent is\ncritical. Healthcare 4.0 systems can incorporate patient portals,\
    \ interactive interfaces, and\neducational materials to facilitate patient understanding\
    \ and engagement.\n8. Conclusions\nIoMT and Healthcare 4.0 have the potential\
    \ to revolutionize the healthcare sector. This\nwork discussed the main features\
    \ of the Healthcare 4.0 paradigm and how it will shape the\nfuture of medical\
    \ services from the hardware and communication technology point of view.\nThe\
    \ current challenges of Healthcare 4.0 systems and the main key enabling technologies\n\
    that can solve these challenges were presented. The recent advances and future\
    \ directions\nof Healthcare 4.0 and IoMT are presented, providing a way for researchers\
    \ to go through.\nBy leveraging technology, healthcare systems can become more\
    \ proactive, personalized,\nand efﬁcient. However, data security, privacy, and\
    \ implementation challenges should also\nbe addressed to maximize the beneﬁts\
    \ of these advancements.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.O. and R.A.E.;\

    of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02, 2024 Hodge conjecture
    is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based on its algebraic
    attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation Xingyi Yang and
    1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling has been notably
    propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome
    optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this
    paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without
    model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is
    prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in
    close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across
    neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant
    calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in 3D generation
    tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this
    feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the
    smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing

    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning

    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the Padé AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the Padé AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical
    expressions. Advanced Cardiovascular Health in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare
    Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April 02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare
    4.0, there is increased interest from researchers the world over in the application
    of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence
    (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare challenges. The era of Quantum Computing
    (QC) promises to bring significant advancements in several areas of healthcare
    such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid Quantum/Classical paradigm its
    own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will extend the reach of Healthcare4Q
    with the help of diverse technologies such as quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure
    transfer and storage of data, and quantum computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All
    of these technologies promise to catapult Healthcare4Q to become the most capable
    healthcare framework in the advancement of medical innovations and improvement
    of patient care. An integral part of a person''s health lies in cardiovascular
    health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing cardiovascular health remains vital
    to the broader goals of public health and healthcare sustainability. In this study,
    under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q, we propose a framework called the Quantum
    AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF) that can provide advanced predictive
    intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing historical and real-time data
    and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q. We show that when applied
    to various diagnostics and health indicators such as ECG data, the Quantum AI
    provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared to the classical methods
    thus proving itself to be the critical component that will herald the era of Healthcare4Q.
    QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and
    Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the
    optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating
    quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present
    a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading
    by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the
    ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal
    outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences
    for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during
    loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic
    algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional and 2-dimensional GA components.
    Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods
    in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those
    methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Results
    underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles.
    Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS
    (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS
    (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance
    than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix Addressing Method for
    Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01, 2024 This letter proposes
    a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce the number of controlling
    (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays. Phase shifting of each radiation
    element is accomplished in two stages by the row and column biasing lines located
    at two stacked layers, which offer a pair of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna
    array with M rows and N columns, conventional direct addressing designs need M
    * N biasing lines, while the proposed method needs only M+N biasing lines to complete
    the full-space beam-steering. The proposed method simplifies the routing of control
    lines and the design of driving circuits. Both theoretical and numerical analyses
    are provided to validate this method. Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for
    Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April
    01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware implementations are crucial for the
    widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms like FALCON.
    One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT),
    which needs to be performed with many prime numbers. Having one set of twiddle
    factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these TFs impractical. In this
    paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs on the fly for FALCON-oriented
    NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our approach dynamically generates
    TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing on-chip memory requirements.
    The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant improvements, with the
    proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by 99%, occupying 95% less
    area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional ROM-based implementation.
    Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum clock frequency, indicating
    superior performance in accessing twiddle factors. These findings highlight the
    potential of our proposed architecture for efficient hardware implementations
    of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. Enhancing Renewable Energy-Grid Integration
    by Optimally Placed FACTS Devices: The Ni... Nnaemeka Sunday Ugwuanyi and 5 more
    April 01, 2024 The global shift towards renewable energy (RE) sources, driven
    by climate change and fossil fuel depletion, encounters challenges in integrating
    intermittent sources like wind and solar power into existing grids. Developing
    countries, such as Nigeria, with weak grids, face significant limitations on RE
    penetration. This study focuses on enhancing RE grid integration in Nigeria by
    strategically deploying Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS)
    devices. Results obtained from the Nigerian grid indicate that FACTS devices,
    particularly STATCOMs, can extend the penetration limit by 40%, enabling an additional
    152 MW of wind energy to be integrated without jeopardizing system stability.
    Improved voltage profiles and enhanced stability highlight the effectiveness of
    FACTS devices in facilitating RE integration into weak grids. Thus, developing
    grids can accommodate more renewable energy without extensive reconfiguration
    of the power system architecture. Doppler Shift Distribution in Satellite Constellations
    Akram Al-Hourani April 01, 2024 Doppler shift has significant implications in
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations due to the rapid relative movement of satellites.
    This paper presents a novel approach based on stochastic geometry to capture the
    statistical distribution of Doppler shift in modern mega satellite constellations.
    We derive a simplified expression for both the Doppler shift s-curve and its maximum
    value, highlighting the dependency of Doppler shifts on the zenith angle of the
    closest approach during a satellite pass. Additionally, we present a stochastic
    model for the distribution of these zenith angles within the random constellation
    model. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of the Doppler bound is analytically
    formulated and validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of two major
    satellite constellations currently in orbit. Effect of Presenting Stiffness of
    Robot Hand to Human on Human-Robot Handovers Junya Yamamoto and 2 more April 01,
    2024 In the present study, we focus on the object handover task as a major example
    of collaborative work between a human and a robot. To achieve a smooth handover
    between two different agents, their mutual communication is indispensable for
    understanding the other’s intentions. However, previous research has not dealt
    with a moment during handover in which a robot takes the object from a human grasp
    or in which a robot hands the object to the human. It should be noted that the
    performance during those phases is crucial to the success or failure of the tasks
    because slight changes in the kinematics of the relationship between hands or
    fingers and object result in significant changes in grasping status: the human
    may forcibly pull out the object while the robot is grasping it or drop the object.
    Therefore, this study aims to realize a smooth handover between a human and a
    robot, focusing on the moment of object handover. To this end, this paper proposes
    to present the stiffness of the robot hand to the human. We conducted the subject
    experiments to investigate the effect of this method on humans in the human-robot
    interaction. Experimental results show that this presentation method enables the
    worker to recognize the stiffness of the robot, which is difficult to recognize
    visually, thereby reducing the workload and allowing the worker to respond seamlessly
    to changes in the robot’s stiffness. VABAM: Variational Autoencoder for Amplitude-based
    Biosignal Augmentation within Morp... Junetae Kim and 2 more April 01, 2024 Pulsatile
    physiological signals, characterized by rhythmic fluctuations, are vital for assessing
    health conditions and are widely used in wellness devices and medical equipment.
    Despite their significance, models addressing domain-specific unmet needs and
    considerations have not been developed as much as in other fields. Therefore,
    building on the foundation of variational autoencoders, we introduce VABAM, a
    novel model for the amplitude-based synthesis of pulsatile physiological signals.
    The uniqueness of VABAM lies in its ability to maintain the morphological identity
    of signals throughout the synthesis process, achieved by integrating pass filter
    effects within the variational autoencoder architecture. To assess the effectiveness
    of the model, we developed three novel metrics based on joint mutual information.
    These metrics were aimed at evaluating the disentanglement of latent spaces, influence
    of ancillary information on signal morphologies, and controllability of amplitude-based
    synthesis within morphological identities. Comparative analyses demonstrated that
    VABAM and its variants were notably effective at preserving morphological integrity,
    highlighting their potential to minimize morphological distortions in physiological
    signal processing and their compatibility with artificial intelligence models
    employing frequency and amplitude features. Additionally, the proposed metrics,
    compatible with probabilistic models, were empirically proven to capture the characteristics
    of various models from multiple perspectives. In-and-Out Weight Box: A novel approach
    for better network compression and feature se... DaeYoung Kim April 01, 2024 Under
    the commonalities found in the goals of two areas, neural network compression
    and feature selection for dimension reduction, this research focused on finding
    a new method to address both issues: a method that can lead to easier feature
    selection, and an enhancement in the capacity of information flow control of neural
    network compression techniques, especially clustering based compression. Specifically,
    this research focused on creating a novel and effective framework to transform
    the weight matrix between the input layer and the first hidden layer in neural
    networks to be optimal. In other words, a method that can make the weight matrix''s
    structure itself optimal for information extraction. By proposing a simple, yet
    powerful weight clipping + GMM based method called an In-and-Out Weight Box that
    can intrinsically act similar to filtering while increasing the possibility of
    getting better results in compression, the main aim of research was found to be
    satisfied. Using Glioma Grading data from the UCI Repository for checking performance
    of the In-and-Out Weight box in fitting neural networks, it was found that significantly
    better compression results can be achieved in terms of weight sharing via clustering.
    This research also suggests a new feature selection method based on the In-and-Out
    Weight box constraint called IOW-FI, which can lead to solving limitations or
    problems of filtering techniques such as setting the number of components to be
    selected as efficient features or considering joint distributions of feature space.
    Is Complexity an Illusion? Michael Timothy Bennett April 02, 2024 Simplicity is
    held by many to be the key to general intelligence. Simpler models tend to “generalise”,
    identifying the cause or generator of data with greater sample efficiency. The
    implications of the correlation between simplicity and generalisation extend far
    beyond computer science, addressing questions of physics and even biology. Yet
    simplicity is a property of form, while generalisation is of function. In interactive
    settings, any correlation between the two depends on interpretation. In theory
    there could be no correlation and yet in practice, there is. Previous theoretical
    work showed generalisation to be a consequence of “weak” constraints implied by
    function, not form. Experiments demonstrated choosing weak constraints over simple
    forms yielded a 110 − 500% improvement in generalisation rate. Here we show that
    if one does not presuppose an abstraction layer, then all forms have equal complexity.
    However, in the context of a spatially and temporally extended abstraction layer,
    efficiency demands weak constraints take simple forms, and simplicity becomes
    correlated with generalisation. Simplicity has no causal influence on generalisation,
    but appears to due to confounding. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 508 509 Next

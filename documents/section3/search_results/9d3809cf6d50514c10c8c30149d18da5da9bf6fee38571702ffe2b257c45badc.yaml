    traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted the vision
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and storage memory.
    Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained
    IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides
    a comprehensive survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and
    applications. This article starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT.
    Then, we discuss the issues considering the characteristics of multimedia and
    provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications
    supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road traffic
    management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different
    M-IoT applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of
    Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission
    over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing
    and present the relationship between the M-IoT and emerging technologies including
    event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing, Fog/Edge computing and
    Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better routing
    and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. Finally, we

    Turkey SECTION I. Introduction At the beginning of this century, there is a tremendous
    technological revolution in the field of wireless communication and mobile technology.
    However, this revolution is still absent in agriculture despite advances in technology
    making it possible to build and deploy wireless sensor and control networks in
    agricultural field that would radically improve farm efficiencies. This is because
    the current wireless technologies are too expensive and complicated for use in
    the farm. Nevertheless, it will be wrong to say that wireless applications have
    not penetrated the agricultural sector at all. 2-way radios have long been used
    by farmers in many developed countries with large farmlands to contact their employees,
    farm suppliers, equipment dealers, agents and buyers from anywhere at anytime.
    Today, with the wide spread availability of mobile phones and cellular networks,
    the use of mobile phones in agricultural sector is becoming popular replacing
    the use of 2-way radios. The advantage of using 2-way radios and mobile phones
    is that they are wireless tools that are relatively cheap and very simple to use.
    Additionally, mobile phones have one more important advantage, that is that all
    brands of mobile phones are generally compatible. The last decade has witnessed
    a spectacular growth in cellular networks and wireless broadband internet. These
    days wireless broadband internet networks are widespread. There has also been
    a tremendous growth in mobile communication technology in recent times. Mobile
    phones have become a crucial part of our daily life nowadays. Mobile phones have
    evolved a lot in terms of their form, performance and features. Mobile phones
    are no more only an alternative to landlines for making phone calls but have also
    become a computer, GPS, radio and our lifeline to the Internet. Most mobile phones
    nowadays have an operating system that can run various types of application software,
    and are equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS capabilities. For example, PDAs
    (personal digital assistants), such as the ubiquitous Blackberry, combines cellular
    phone service, internet access and computing services. Not only is the advancement
    in technology, there is also a rising popularity of mobile phones globally, including
    countries like India. In India, mobile technology has unleashed a paradigm shift
    in the communication medium to reach out to the masses. Consequently, India has
    outscored other nations in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of number of mobile
    users. With rapidly increasing tele-density, mobile penetration in rural areas
    is also growing strongly. A multitude of innovative mobile phones that come with
    a number of user-friendly features and advanced capabilities are nowadays available
    with people even in rural India, especially among the agrarian community. Motivated
    by the advancement in mobile technology and the wide-spread use of mobile phones
    in India, as discussed above, researchers in India are aiming at helping the agrarian
    community to improve their agricultural activities through use of mobile phones.
    A. Why Agriculture? In many countries, including India, agriculture accounts for
    the majority of rural employment. It also holds the promise for economic growth.
    In fact, agriculture is approximately four times more effective at raising incomes
    among the poor than other sectors. Improved agriculture also has a direct impact
    on hunger and malnutrition, and decreasing the occurrences of famine. However,
    agriculture is facing a range of serious challenges, particularly in developing
    countries. The growing global population has heightened the demand for food. With
    rising food prices, climate change, and lack of infrastructure in rural areas,
    more effective and modern âsmartâ agriculture is essential. In view of this, wireless
    network technology has been utilized in the agricultural sector. Some of the uses
    of on-farm wireless network are as follows [1]â[3]. Remote monitoring of soil
    moisture, environmental condition, irrigation status, monitoring of greenhouse,
    livestock and storage facilties. Remote control of pumps and robotic vehicles.
    Information transfer for automatic incorporation of environmental data into decision
    support systems and crop models. Communication of text, graphical, voice and video
    messages between operators. Asset tracking such as locating irrigation systems,
    farm vehicles and livestocks. Remote diagnosis in which automatic incorporation
    of environmental data into decision support systems and crop models. In this paper,
    we propose to develop a remote diagnosis system for monitoring, control and management
    of agricultural production through use of advanced technology, especially image
    processing and computer vision, information and communication technology, and
    mobile technology. B. M-Agriculture: Mobile-Based Agriculture Information and
    communication technology, and in particular mobile technologies, are often seen
    as a âgame changerâ in agriculture. The already existing mobile-based agricultural
    information service is a giant leap in the field of agriculture which offers a
    plethora of services, and serves as a tool for information dissemination that
    leverages on the modern technology. Various mobile-based services like SMS based
    information services, voice based agri-advisory services, and videos over mobile
    networks, etc. are utilized for transfer of general know-how on farming techniques
    and trends, information on plants and varieties, and how to grow them, etc. Mobile-based
    agriculture (m-Agriculture) refers to the delivery of agriculture-related services
    via mobile communications technology. In order to inform decisions on agricultural
    measures to optimize plant growth, it provides for individual decision-support
    systems and services which are based on localized contextual information, i.e.
    delivering location-specific information based on climatic patterns, soil and
    water conditions,. It also involves gathering relevant data through mobile technologies
    like automated weather stations or systems equipped with sensors for location-based
    collection. Thus, m-Agriculture involves two-way advisory systems that provide
    individual feedback and advice such as remote diagnosis of diseases by experts.
    These systems typically include the use of smartphones and intermediaries for
    the communication with farmers and require remote sensing instruments and GIS.
    To turn an m-Agriculture initiative into a viable and self-sustaining product,
    certain critical criteria must be addressed. m-Agriculture projects are built
    on the opportunities provided by increasing use of mobile phones by farmers in
    developing countries. Accordingly, the primary objective of this paper is to develop
    a mobile-based vision system for plant disease diagnosis via plant leaf imaging
    and analysis. C. Mobile-Based Vision System for Plant Disease Diagnosis Plant
    diseases are caused by pathogens. Correct diagnosis and identification of these
    pathogens is the most important step in the eventual control of a plant disease.
    Microscopy, culturing, a few simple biochemical tests, and ELISA are the mainstays
    for most routine laboratory diagnoses [4]. Other than these, we also rely on visual
    examination for on-the-field diagnosis. In most of the cases, pests or diseases
    are seen on the leaves, stems or fruits of the plant. Therefore, finding out symptoms
    of the pest or disease attack on leaves, stems or fruits of plants, subsequent
    identification of the pest or diseases, and estimating the percentage of the attack
    play a key role in successful cultivation of crops. However, performance of such
    diagnosis is limited by details that can be visualized by the naked eyes and the
    expertise of the farmer/expert. There is also demand from farmers and agricultural
    administrators for rapid, timely and accurate diagnosis of pathogens to guide
    disease management decision making. Due to shortage of trained field and clinical
    pathologists and other necessary resources, it has become necessary to find innovative
    ways to maximize the delivery of diagnostic services to agriculture. A solution
    to this may be to capture the image of the diseased parts of the plant and then
    study the same for classifying lesion, scoring quantitative traits, calculating
    infected area, etc. Artificial vision system is one of the emerging technologies
    that mimic a human vision system in reality. Image and vision have covered almost
    all fields in our daily life presenting us with ubiquitous devices and ubiquitous
    computing in an anytime-anywhere scenario. These days cameras are standard on
    mobile phones, sometimes with picture quality as good as many stand-alone digital
    cameras. Therefore, it is possible to directly capture the image of the diseased
    part of a plant and process the image to know about the disease and the extent
    of infection. These images are shared with experts for diagnosis and expert opinion
    through specific communication networks and wireless communication channels including
    Wi-Fi and cellular network. Thus, a mobile-based plant disease diagnosis system
    is made available to farmers. Application of computer vision techniques in plant
    research is already in place. One very important aspect in plant research and
    botany is the identification of plant species and genus. Plant species recognition
    depends on many features such as the plant shape, size, and most importantly its
    leaves. The leaf of a plant is characterized in terms of its shape, size, color,
    vein pattern, edge pattern and texture. While the size, color and vein pattern
    may vary from place to place depending on the climatic condition, leaf shape,
    edge and texture features are independent and omnipresent. The leaf shape as an
    important feature defining the plant species has already been proved and used
    by many researchers in automatic identification of plant species, including some
    mobile-based systems [5]â[8]. On the other hand, research in plant disease diagnosis
    using computer vision is very thin. Scientific community have performed some researches
    on specific diseases [9]â[12], but is yet to come up with a general algorithm
    suitable for every disease or at least a majority of diseases. This paper presents
    a scheme for using mobile phones for real-time data capture via imaging of diseased
    plant leaves, on-field image segmentation and spotting of disease patch, and transmission
    of data to plant pathology laboratory for disease diagnosis via analysis of visual
    phenotypes. Through the mobile service linkage available the system will communicate
    plant disease related information between the farmers on the field and the agricultural
    administrator and/or the laboratory. The system will utilize the images of diseased
    patches on the leaf of the plants along with other environmental information such
    as the location, climatic condition, etc. to compute and identify the disease,
    extent of its spread and the possibility of its outbreak. Mobile phones nowadays
    are generally equipped with camera making it possible to capture the images in
    the field and directly transmit the same, as necessary. Further, these mobile
    phones come with good enough computing power to accomplish complete leaf image
    analysis and disease diagnosis in the mobile device itself. However, the primary
    constraint with mobile computing is the limited energy. The leaf image analysis
    and disease diagnosis task is generally computation intensive demanding energy
    too large to perform on a mobile system. This calls for offloading some part of
    the processing task to a central server located at the plant pathology laboratory.
    This, therefore, requires transmission of the leaf image from the mobile device
    to the server. The amount of data that may be transmitted is, on the other hand,
    constrained by the wireless bandwidth. Hence, a trade-off between the offloading
    and the transmission cost is necessary. In our proposed scheme, we propose to
    perform simple plant leaf segmentation only in the mobile device. The segmented
    leaf image is then transmitted, instead of the whole leaf image, thereby saving
    in transmission cost. Fig. 1 depicts the proposed system architecture. A detailed
    description of our proposed scheme is given in the section to follow. Fig. 1.
    Proposed system architecture. Show All SECTION II. Proposed Methodology A. Leaf
    Image Segmentation In image, video and vision applications image segmentation
    is a fundamental step to separate homogeneous regions. For image analysis and
    image understanding, proper segmentation is a necessary condition. Features such
    as color histogram, texture or edge based methods are used for finding homogeneous
    regions in an image [12]. Image segmentation methods are classified as supervised
    or unsupervised. The supervised segmentation approach predefines the characteristics
    of different regions in an image whereas in unsupervised segmentation there is
    no such prior information. Unsupervised algorithms includes splitting-merging
    method [14], local and multi-resolution features [15], Markov random field model
    [16] and many others which are computationally complex and memory consuming. The
    advantage of such algorithms is that no comparison is required against the manually
    segmented ground-truth. Unsupervised image segmentation is very useful in real
    time systems where large variety of natural images need to be segmented. Plant
    leaf image is a natural image full of challenges and hence needs a dynamic adjustment
    of segmentation parameters for better results. For this, cluster-based unsupervised
    image segmentation methods [17]â[19] prove to be useful. In [17], Puzicha et al.
    proposed an efficient novel mixture model to cluster histogram data with multi-scale
    formulation. In [18], Bong and Lam proposed multi-objective scatter for image
    segmentation using concepts of Pareto dominance on gray images (CT scan and SAR).
    The four necessary criteria for unsupervised image segmentation given by Haralick
    and Shapiro [20], [21] are Uniform and homogeneous regions with respect to some
    common characteristic(s). Significant difference between adjacent regions with
    respect to the characteristic(s). Absence of any hole in a region. Simple and
    spatially accurate region boundaries. In our work, we propose to use k -means
    clustering approach [22] for color leaf image segmentation. An image is composed
    of foreground and background. In our work, we assume that the leaf image is available
    with simple and uniform background. The leaf again is composed of two different
    regions - the normal green part and the disease patch. Accordingly, we apply k
    -means clustering for segmentation with k=3 corresponding to the three regions
    in the leaf image - background, normal green leafy part and the disease patch
    region. The RGB leaf image captured by the mobile device is first converted into
    CIE (Comission Internationale de l''Eclairage) L*a*b color model so as to make
    the input image device independent. The CIE L*a*b color space is specified by
    the International Commission on Illumination for use as a reference color model
    since it is close to the color model visible to human eye. A 5Ã5 averaging filter
    mask is applied over the L*a*b image to remove unwanted noise [23]. Following
    this, the clustering algorithm is applied to identify and segment out the three
    different regions from the input image. Fig. 2 shows all the three clusters in
    a leaf image where the first cluster is the background with constant intensity
    value, the second cluster is the green non-diseased portion in the leaf and the
    third cluster is the region of interest (ROI), i.e. the disease patch in the leaf.
    Fig. 2. Results of leaf image segmentation. Show All B. Selection of Diseased
    Patch The image of the diseased leaf captured by the mobile device in the field
    needs to be transmitted to some central server present in the pathology laboratory.
    In [5], White et al. captured and transmitted the complete image to a tablet PC
    located nearby. However, this requires a proper connection and a high speed Internet
    connectivity. Indian telecommunication technology is still in the developing stage
    and except in urban places such high speed connectivity is not available. Whereas,
    the application under consideration is mainly based in rural areas. Thus, transferring
    a complete image to a server needs a high bandwidth. This is taken care of to
    some extent by the image cropping step. Among all the diseased patch obtained
    in a leaf image, the largest size patch is identified, cropped and transmitted.
    By this, only the relevant part of the leaf image is transmitted while discarding
    unnecessary portions of the image. Fig. 3 shows a disease patch cropped out of
    a leaf image. Since the computational requirement of these two steps, viz. segmentation
    and cropping, is generally not high, the energy consumed in the mobile device
    is small enough to support the application. C. Transmission of the Cropped Image
    Finally, the cropped image is easily transferred to a high processing server or
    computing device located at the pathology laboratory through a wireless communication
    channel. The transmission method can be any of the available networks, e.g. 2G,
    3G, 4G, Wi-Fi and so on. In order to achieve high transmission efficiency, only
    the blob corresponding to the largest disease patch is transmitted in color format.
    This ensures that no information regarding the disease symptoms is lost. Other
    than the ROI, all other regions in the cropped leaf image, viz. background and
    the non-diseased leaf portion, as identified via the clustering process, are of
    no use for the purpose of disease diagnosis. Accordingly, we propose to encode
    every pixel in these regions with a single zero bit thereby reducing the transmission
    cost both in terms of bandwidth and power. Fig. 3. The largest disease patch in
    the leaf image of Fig. 2 cropped out. Show All D. Energy Consideration Since mobile
    devices are battery operated, the energy in both computation and transmission
    should be conserved. There are three possibilities through which this architecture
    can reduce the computation and communication cost. They are compute every operation
    on the server, compute feature extraction on the mobile device and analyze it
    on server using machine learning algorithm, and perform low-level image processing
    operations such as pre-processing on the mobile device and the rest of the algorithm
    on the server. In all of these approaches, transmission media is very much required
    and a constant connection is important. In respect of power consumption, the first
    approach will consume less energy but bandwidth requirement will be high. This
    option requires to transmit the whole image captured by the mobile phone. Hence,
    a high-speed broad-band connection is required. In India, transmission media is
    generally very low and thus second approach will be more preferable. Nonetheless,
    this approach consumes huge battery power. Therefore, the third approach provides
    a better trade-off between the two. Suppose that the total process of leaf image
    analysis and disease diagnosis requires C instructions. Also, suppose that the
    size of the leaf image is D bytes. Let the power consumed by the mobile system
    be P c for computing and P t for transmitting data. If the mobile system performs
    the total procedure, the energy consumption is E c = P c Ã C M (1) View Source
    where M is the processing speed of the mobile device in terms of instructions
    per second. If the total procedure is computed in the central server, then the
    energy consumed in transmitting the whole leaf image is E t = P t Ã DÃ8 B (2)
    View Source where B is the network bandwidth in bits/sec. Therefore, computing
    every operation on the server (first option above) is beneficial only when E c
    > E t . This requires D B sufficiently small compared to C M . Accordingly, offloading
    is preferred when the available bandwidth B is very large. As proposed in our
    method, we perform only the segmentation and cropping in the mobile device. Let,
    the number of instructions involved in doing this is Î±C , where Î±<1 . That is,
    Î± is the fraction of total computation involved in the segmentation process. Also,
    let the total data size of the segmented image that is transmitted is Î²D bytes,
    where Î²<1 is the fraction of the total data after cropping. Then the total energy
    consumed by the mobile system in our proposed scheme is E total = P c ÃÎ± C M +
    P t ÃÎ² DÃ8 B (3) View Source Partial offloading, as proposed in our scheme, will
    be beneficial when E total is less than both E c and E t . Given the parameters
    M, P c and P t of the mobile device and the network bandwidth B , the system requires
    to calculate E c , E t and E total and then decide for complete offloading with
    all computations in the central server ( E t minimum), no offloading with all
    computations in the mobile device ( E c minimum), or partial offloading, as per
    our proposed scheme ( E total minimum). It may be noted from (2) that the channel
    bandwidth directly affects the energy consumption of a device. The higher the
    bandwidth, the lower the energy consumption while transferring the image. If the
    bandwidth is low the energy consumption to transmit the same image is more. Therefore,
    there is a need to reduce the image size by some means. Accordingly, segmentation
    plus image cropping is performed, as described above. SECTION III. Experimental
    Results The complete system is designed using OpenCV and Android operating system.
    The minimum hardware requirement for mobile devices is 1 GHz processor and 256
    MB RAM. Here, though multi-core processors are available, the experiments are
    carried out on single core processor to actually measure the computational cost
    and time factor associated with it. A total of 297 diseased leaf samples are captured
    using different mobile devices at different resolutions. The segmentation results
    of few leaf samples are shown in Fig. 4. The computation time with different resolutions
    using the proposed algorithm are plotted in Fig. 5. It is observed that lower
    the resolution, the faster is the computation, as expected. Table I shows the
    relative comparison in the data size and transmission time between transmission
    of the complete leaf image and the segmented leaf image. Clearly, it is seen that
    the segmented leaf image requires less transmission cost to transfer over a wireless
    medium. The transmission link used in our experiments is a high speed wireless
    connection of 54 Mbps. Fig. 4. Segmentation results of four different leaf images.

    images with different resolutions. Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion This paper
    proposes a new CIE L*a*b* color based unsupervised segmentation for natural image.
    Texture feature is used to cluster the leaf image regions employing k -means clustering
    to segment diseased portion from leaf images. The L*a*b* color space makes the
    approach more flexible, robust and device independent. Unsupervised image segmentation
    adds scalability in segmenting images captured by cameras with varying resolutions
    in different mobile phones. The second task of this work is to reduce the communication
    cost such that the application be performed in real time by transmitting only
    the ROI in the leaf image. The third objective of the proposed scheme is to reduce
    the power consumption in the mobile device. The results obtained in our experiments
    show that the proposed method may be effectively used for reducing the total power
    consumption at the mobile end. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Get rights and content Abstract The continuing Machine Learning (ML) revolution
    indubitably has had a significant positive impact on the analysis of downlinked
    satellite data. Other aspects of the Earth Observation industry, despite being
    less susceptible to widespread application of Machine Learning, are also following
    this trend. These applications, actual use cases, possible prospects and difficulties,
    as well as anticipated research gaps, are the focus of this review of Machine
    Learning applied to Earth Observation Operations. A wide range of topics are covered,
    including mission planning, fault diagnosis, fault prognosis and fault repair,
    optimization of telecommunications, enhanced GNC, on-board image processing, and
    the use of Machine Learning models on platforms with constrained compute and power
    capabilities, as well as recommendations in the respective areas of research.
    The review tackles all on-board and off-board applications of machine learning
    to Earth Observation with one notable exception: it omits all post-processing
    of payload data on the ground, a topic that has been studied extensively by past
    authors. In addition, this review article discusses the standardization of Machine
    Learning (i.e., Guidelines and Roadmaps), as well as the challenges and recommendations
    in Earth Observation operations for the purpose of building better space missions.

    SystemsXAIExplainable AI 1. Introduction Earth Observation (EO) satellites have
    allowed us to look at our planet at a scale previously unattainable to humankind.
    From the vantage point of space, it becomes easier to monitor everything about
    our lives on a very large scale, such as our impact on the planetâs ecology (Guo
    et al., 2017) and extent of specific facilities all around the world (Pan et al.,
    2021). This capability has been and continues to be invaluable to understanding
    the world around us and enforcing regulations vital to the well-being of people
    all over the globe. However, as access to space becomes ever more affordable,
    EO assets multiply at an increasingly faster pace (Belward and SkÃ¸ien, 2015).
    Moreover, EO Operations - the sequence of activities that take place in managing
    an EO spacecraft from its launch to its demise - keep growing in number and complexity
    as new assets are put into orbit. These trends could soon lead to a situation
    where available work-power becomes a limiting factor in the deployment of EO systems.
    Orchestrating these operations is, at its core, a control and data processing
    problem - from taking in and analyzing large volumes of telemetry from all EO
    platforms to taking into account their complex dynamics and evolving mission profiles
    when utilizing them. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent in
    our daily lives, whether it is in the form of personalized newsfeeds, shopping
    online or streaming movie recommendations, or even mapping tools that help us
    avoid traffic jams. On a larger scale, AI is already having a significant impact
    on healthcare, banking, agriculture, and a variety of other industries, and its
    impact is expected to grow quickly in the coming years. Machine Learning (ML),
    a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as shown in Fig. 1 wherein machines learn
    from data, has been used in a variety of space-related applications. In our review,
    we considered that ML is a subfield of AI for clarification. Deep learning (DL)
    is a subfield of machine learning. Download : Download high-res image (117KB)

    al., 2021). Human analysts may miss patterns and trends hidden within massive
    amounts of data, but ML can find them. ML, on the other hand, can uncover patterns
    and trends hidden inside massive amounts of data that are invisible to human researchers.
    Modern Earth Observation systems collect a massive amount of data from a variety
    of sensors with varying temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions. Because of
    its complexity, it necessitates the use of innovative procedures and methods to
    extract useful information. Fig. 2 represents a typical machine learning process.

    Fig. 2. Machine Learning workflow (Pant, 2019). 1.1. Machine learning for Earth
    observation ML has taken the data processing world by storm, with one success
    story after another. From object detection and classification (Krizhevsky et al.,
    2012) to natural language processing (Wang, 2021) and nonlinear control (Mnih
    et al., 2013), the capacity of these algorithms to solve different types of problems
    has been nothing short of awe-inspiring. For the purposes of the present review,
    we define ML algorithms as those whose performance critically depends on and generally
    improves with exposure to real-world data of the problem to be solved. So far,
    these techniques have concentrated mostly on the analysis of downlinked imagery
    due to the larger availability of computing power and ease of deployment relative
    to on-board applications, as well as its relatedness to computer vision, one of
    the traditional strong suits of ML. But applications to other aspects of operations
    are now starting to surface. The present review explores the contexts for which
    these applications have been proposed or in which they have been applied, exposes
    the possibilities that they open up and risks that must be avoided, and illustrates
    gaps in research that we believe should be addressed by the Earth Observation
    community. As shown in Fig. 3, ML will enhance space exploration operations in
    a variety of ways, particularly for Earth observation missions. Download : Download

    of ML for earth observation mission. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the manuscript
    discusses the state-of-the-art as well as the future prospects of ML in Mission
    Planning (section 2), GNC (section 3), FDIR (section 4), and on-board image processing
    (section 5). In section 6, we also discussed the useful aspect of using ML models
    in EO operations. We examine how operators might make the most of their limited
    on-board resources by properly optimizing the usage of ML model resources, describing
    a variety of software and hardware solutions geared to that end. In Section 7,
    we also discuss recent initiatives within the space sector to standardize and
    guide the deployment of ML models, as well as the kinds of considerations a designer
    must make in order to avoid frequent errors with this technology. Our objective
    is to give EO Operators a thorough, if not exhaustive, assessment of the current
    situation with regard to ML applications in their area of expertise. The review
    connects EO operators and proponents of ML algorithms for EO Operations problems
    in an effort to spark discussion and stimulate additional application suggestions
    and demonstrations. With one important exception, the review covers all on-board
    and off-board applications of ML to EO but leaves out all post-processing of payload
    data on the ground, a subject that has been intensively researched by other researchers.
    The optimization of tracking, telemetry, and command is another subject we pass
    over. Despite the fact that this was initially our intention, we discovered an
    outstanding and current review by Fourati and Alouini (Fourati and Alouini, 2021).
    We invite interested readers to check out the excellent paper rather than pointlessly
    duplicating their work. This article has been reviewed and updated in comparison
    to the conference paper presented at IAC in 2021. This research, which is highly
    needed in present space industry, was conducted by a group of volunteers from
    the Small Satellite Project Group (SSPG) of SGAC. SGAC is a non-profit, non-governmental
    organization with over 16,000 members dedicated to the peaceful uses of space.
    There are over a hundred active volunteers, in addition to eleven project organizations,
    including the SSPG. The SSPG focuses on how small satellites are utilized in the
    space industry and how they can assist humanity in realizing space''s full potential.
    2. Machine learning in Earth observation mission planning There are many constraints
    to mission planning. Some relate to the target area: It needs to be under the
    satellite and illuminated by the sun at capture time (orbit and time-dependent);
    clouds are to be avoided (weather dependent); the requester may set a deadline
    and/or a priority. Others relate to the satellite, such as limited memory capacity;
    limited transmission capability; reduced communication opportunities with the
    ground antennas; multiple sensors to choose from; and limited maneuverability
    to skew the observation angle and reach areas not directly flown over. All of
    these parameters make optimal scheduling of observations a highly combinational
    problem for a mission that supports multiple independent requests, and it is even
    more complex when they are accomplished by a constellation of satellites. ML proposes
    a series of algorithms that may find better solutions than non-learning algorithms
    or do so more efficiently. There are many different formulations of the observation
    scheduling problem, taking into account different subsets of the constraints presented
    in the previous paragraphs, adapted for different types of missions and ground
    segments. 2.1. Classical approaches Non-ML algorithms to the satellite scheduling
    problems can be classified into two categories: Exact and Heuristic methods (X.
    Wang et al., 2021). Exact methods typically consist of a combination of branch
    and bound methods and mixed-integer linear programming. These methods are computationally
    costly and can become intractable for moderately sized constellations. Heuristic
    methods use an approximated rule to guide the construction of a solution. Greedy
    algorithms construct a solution by gradually choosing the best action at every
    decision step according to some metric, without regard as to how the overall sequence
    of decisions plays out. Other heuristic methods include backtracking through constraint
    programming and search algorithms. Other forms of search include hill-climbing
    or squeaky-wheel optimization, where the geometry of the optimization functions
    is exploited to accelerate the search process. Globus et al. (Globus et al., 2003)
    compare multiple algorithms such as genetic, simulated annealing, squeaky wheel
    and hill-climbing on a problem with one or two satellites. Evolutionary or genetic
    algorithms simulate processes akin to biological evolution to optimize candidate
    solutions according to a hand-crafted fitness function. Mansour et al. (Mansour
    and Dessouky, 2010) studied the performances of a genetic algorithm for a single
    satellite with limited memory and multiple instruments and imaging modes. Li et
    al. (Li et al., 2014) explore genetic algorithms in order to provide scheduling
    in real-time, optimizing the transmission path towards the user. Simulated annealing
    imitates the annealing processes found in metals exposed to high temperatures,
    and it forms the basis for another branch of heuristic algorithms. The simulated
    annealing seems to provide better results, confirmed by Globus et al. (Globus
    et al., 2003) in a complete multi-satellite formulation of the problem, including
    satellite agility and priorities. Lastly, multi-agent systems simulate interactions
    between simple agents representing part of the systems to determine an optimal
    policy. Bonnet et al. (Bonnet et al., 2015) use a self-adaptive multi-agent system
    for real-time and robust adaptation of a multi-satellite problem, including request
    priorities. 2.2. ML-based approaches ML-based approaches can exploit the statistical
    distribution of typical problem settings to accelerate the finding of good solutions
    to the mission planning problem. Wang et al. (X. Wang et al., 2021) present a
    comprehensive review of publications on the agile observation scheduling problem,
    including ML and non-ML approaches. The authors classify approaches along multiple
    axes such as time continuous and discrete-time model, type of solving method and
    also other features such as autonomy, and multi-objective profit function. Neural
    Networks (NNs) are explored by Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2019) in order to provide
    immediate results for a multi-satellite mission using Deep Reinforcement Learning
    (DRL). Peng et al. (Peng et al., 2018) apply recursive NNs in a sequential decision-making
    process in order to achieve low scheduling computation time and high performance
    when compared to a deterministic resolution. Recursive NNs allow the model to
    condition current decisions on past inputs, instead of depending exclusively on
    the present inputs to the system, providing the model with a sort of memory. We
    have not found any applications of Transformers to this problem, a sequence modeling
    technique from the deep learning research field that has shown excellent results
    in other sequential tasks like language modeling and even in image processing
    tasks. Neuroevolutionary techniques combine the advantages of neural models and
    evolutionary algorithms. Du et al. (Du et al., 2020) leverage a prediction model
    trained by a Cooperative Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm in
    order to filter tasks to be scheduled according to the probability to be fulfilled
    before scheduling using genetic algorithms. DRL uses NNs as function approximators
    to approximate hard to determine functions in dynamic programming. This has enabled
    groundbreaking achievements in other control and scheduling problems like playing
    Go or automated driving. Despite its potential, it has not been extensively applied
    to this problem set. Liu (Liu, 2020) applies Proximal Policy Optimization, a method
    of the DRL literature, to mission planning for a single satellite. Unfortunately,
    they do not compare performance to other methods or extend it to a multi-satellite
    setting. Yuchen et al. offer a unique online strategy that combines a Q-network
    with a pruning technique to address the observation sequence planning problem.
    The proposed scheme''s goal is to generate an observation sequence based on the
    Q-learning heuristic rule and increase the neural network''s efficiency in optimization.
    A Q-network-based mission-planning algorithm for the operation of the EO satellite
    is shown in Fig. 4. It shows the suggested algorithm''s overall workflow (Liu
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. ML-based mission planning algorithm (Liu et al., 2021).
    Hadj-Salah et al. (Hadj-Salah et al., 2020, Hadj-Salah et al., 2019) explore the
    application of Actor-Critic (A2C), a DRL algorithm, to the mission planning problem.
    They compare it to random planning and a planning heuristic that compromises between
    greedy and long-term planning. Their models are trained in a simulated mission
    planning environment and then executed in a real test scenario. Their long-term
    version of A2C shows better performance than the heuristic algorithm. In their
    later publication, they augment the training process with techniques from the
    domain randomization and transfer learning literature, meant to increase robustness
    to the gap experienced when passing from the simulated training scenario to the
    real validation scenario. 2.3. Recommendations Mission planning is a very rich
    problem that has been explored for many years using machine learning amongst other
    solutions. Comparing the performances of algorithms presented in different papers
    is not a suitable path because each presents its own definition of the problem,
    with a unique set of constraints, different mission characteristics, variable
    satellite capabilities and potentially incompatible metrics. For instance, a lot
    of schedulers take into account satellite memory, limiting the number of observations
    until a ground station is visible, but few of them also make sure the ground station
    is available for communication with the satellite and not busy communicating with
    another one of the constellations. Song et al. (Song et al., 2020) introduce a
    framework in order to facilitate future comparisons but additional work on model
    standardization is needed before results from different studies can be compared.
    We observe a shifting trend in algorithms applied to this problem over the years
    from genetic or annealing to ML approaches such as NNs. Unfortunately, we found
    no sources comparing the performances of genetic and ML-based schedulers on a
    single problem formulation. Standardizing project formulations, constraints set,
    and optimization metrics seem to be a necessary step for sustainable collaborative
    research in this field. Relying on Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
    (CCSDS) published standards and models could be a first step in the direction
    of a unified approach. 3. Machine learning in Earth observation guidance, navigation
    and control GNC, describe the set of operations needed to move a satellite platform
    or any other vehicle. The guidance relates to planning paths from a current state
    to the desired state. Navigation is the determination of the present state. Control
    is the correct use of spacecraft actuators, such as an engine, to execute the
    desired plan. 3.1. Classical approaches Two main tasks need to be achieved by
    a GNC system: determination of the current state, which is an estimation task,
    and use of the spacecraftâs actuators to go from the current state to the desired
    state, which is a control task. Spacecraft control is typically subdivided into
    at least two different granularity levels, guidance and control, where guidance
    is the high-level control of the spacecraft from a current dynamic state to a
    future one. A guidance module may output the sequence of feasible dynamic states
    necessary to achieve a new orbit from the required orbit. EO Satellite maneuvers
    are often planned and optimized on the ground, and the onboard guidance modules
    are minimal. For the control task, a number of control schemes are used, most
    notably controllers from the robust control literature such as Hâ controllers.
    As for navigation, spacecraft state is typically determined via variants of the
    Kalman Filter (KF), such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)or the Unscented Kalman
    Filter (UKF). These methods are model based, that is, they depend on an explicit
    model of spacecraft dynamics for their calculations. Fuzzy controllers have been
    proposed as a possible improvement to the classical approach. The literature contains
    several works where GNC and Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) controllers
    based on fuzzy logic are compared to their traditional counterparts. For instance,
    Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2001) studied the fuzzy logic controller with the X-38 re-entry
    vehicle. ESA also investigated the usage of fuzzy logic controllers to carry out
    Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) rendezvous autonomously (Ortega, 1995) to
    aid in in-orbit manufacturing. As another example, in (Cheng et al., 2009), a
    simulation of ROCSAT-1 / FORMOSAT-1â²s attitude controller is carried out, where
    the classical setup of a Proportional - Integral (PI) pitch axis controller and
    Proportional - Integral - Derivative (PID) roll/yaw axis controller is replaced
    with two fuzzy controllers initially, and a single consolidated fuzzy controller
    afterwards, yielding considerable improvements against interference as well as
    a lower steady-state error. Nevertheless, despite the body of research backing
    up their effectiveness, there is no widespread use of fuzzy logic GNC controllers
    for space missions. 3.2. ML-based approaches Izzo et al. (Izzo et al., 2018) present
    a survey of Artificial Intelligence applied to GNC which, is not focused on EO
    applications, can nonetheless be useful to practitioners. The survey contains
    a section focusing on ML approaches, on top of other AI approaches such as evolutionary
    algorithms. In another publication (Izzo and ÃztÃ¼rk, 2021), Izzo and ÃztÃ¼rk leveraged
    DRL to plan near-optimal real-time computation of low-thrust transfers. They also
    suggest a new method to generate training data for such problem settings. Although
    originally designed for Earth-Venus transfers, their solution is applicable to
    all low-thrust transfers, but the data generation algorithm and optimality comparisons
    are problem-dependent. ML excels in problems where no structured pre-existing
    model can be exploited. That is not the case for the GNC problem, where the general
    form of the dynamics governing spacecraft are well known and solvable. It is,
    however, the case for visual-based GNC, as no model exists for relating camera
    inputs to dynamic state or control actions. For this reason, much research on
    ML-powered GNC has focused on visual-based GNC (FrÃ©dÃ©ric FÃ©rÃ©sin et al., 2021)
    for autonomous rendezvous. This, however, is not directly relevant to the EO Operations
    community, who are unlikely to engage in autonomous docking as providers. An interesting
    streak of research looks into applications of ML to processing visual navigation
    sensors, particularly Earth and Sun sensors and star trackers. Koizumi et al.
    (Koizumi et al., 2018) present a dl-powered Earth sensor capable of determining
    the attitude of the spacecraft by processing the images captured by a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
    (COTS) camera. It runs a real-time image processing algorithm to extract features
    into the images separating them into distinct feature sets using DL techniques.
    The features sets are then compared to the preloaded data sets to determine the
    position of the spacecraft relative to Earth in the 3D plane. The primary advantage
    of the system is the use of a COTS component and a single board computer. Another
    research thread explores the combination of ML techniques and fuzzy controllers
    (Kim et al., 2016). Classical fuzzy controllers rely on manually set parameters
    that define behavior. This research thread attempts to leverage ML techniques
    to learn the optimal value for these parameters from a training dataset. These
    have the advantage of interpretability - their reliance on explicitly (if fuzzily
    enforced) rules means that they remain grounded on human-interpretable system
    models. Joghataieâ PhD. thesis (Joghataie, 1994) suggests the development of a
    neuro-fuzzy controller, wherein the tuning of the fuzzy logic is performed automatically
    by using neural networks in a hybrid approach. Azarbad (Azarbad et al., 2014)
    suggests a model applied to Global Positioning System (GPS) systems that outperform
    the classical fuzzy controller. A simulation study on MATLAB was done by Baranwal
    et al. in (Baranwal et al., 2018), comparing the performance of a PID controller
    and a fuzzy PID controller for a student satellite team. The EKF-based fuzzy controller
    outperformed the classical controller. The study was done on a 3U CubeSat. Further
    research can be done comparing these controllers with ML-based approaches. We
    have been unable to find a comparison between the three types of controllers,
    i.e., neuro-based controller, fuzzy controller and a hybrid model, as implementation
    details in different studies differ, complicating their comparison. Wang et al.
    (Wang et al., 2019) have developed a DL framework that stabilizes the spacecraft
    using a real-time torque control. It is initially trained in a simulation environment,
    enabling it to learn the required torque output and extrapolate it for unknown
    disturbances. It performs better than a conventional PID controller, as it can
    correct the attitude after unknown disturbance rather than repeatable corrections.
    A similar system is proposed by Yadava et al. (Yadava et al., 2018). They propose
    an Attitude Orbital Determination System (AODS) system that determines the position
    of the spacecraft, taking inputs from the magnetometers (magnetic vectors) and
    sun sensor (sun vector) along with GPS data (position and velocity vector), and
    determines the ideal attitude depending on the position using a neural network.
    The required torque calculations are made and sent to the Reinforcement Learning
    (RL)-based controller to make the required adjustments. The system performs better
    than classical PID controllers as it consumes less computation power for subsequent
    cycles as the algorithm learns. 3.3. Recommendations Most ML for GNC applications
    in the space sector seem to have been explored in the context of space logistics
    and space exploration rather than Earth Observation. Although guidance and control
    for EO platforms are simple compared to these applications, we believe there is
    a potential to adopt some of these technologies. Attitude determination is a domain
    where EO operations have high requirements. We believe that vision-based processing
    applied to this area is just getting started, and that use of more refined neural
    architectures could enable improvements in performance or resource consumption
    compared to current approaches. 4. Machine learning in Earth observation fault
    detection, isolation, and recovery Satellites performing EO tasks have stringent
    requirements in terms of accuracy, continuity and stability of payload operations.
    To this end, Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) is focused on developing
    and improving tools to guarantee and maintain reliable spacecraft operations.
    FDIR describes a set of engineering disciplines focused on safeguarding and maintaining
    the spacecraft in nominal operating conditions. The target of these disciplines
    is represented by faults, irregular occurrences and processes with the potential
    to disrupt the mission up to the point of failure. ML can be an extremely powerful
    tool for FDIR. Indeed, the core capability provided by ML is pattern detection.
    Therefore, ML can be used both to detect anomalies in the telemetry or outputs
    from any subsystem (diagnosis) and identify signs indicating an incipient fault
    (prognosis). This section presents relevant ML literature for four significant
    sub-topics: fault detection, fault diagnosis, recovery, and fault avoidance. 4.1.
    Fault detection Failure detection deals with identifying the presence of faults
    and their rates of occurrence. 4.1.1. Classical approaches In classical approaches,
    the recognition of failures is mainly based on constant thresholds and fixed logic
    diagrams defined during the design process. (Wertz and Larson, 1999) One of the
    key issues with classical fault detection is model brittleness. As fault detection
    schemes are based on hardcoded thresholds, these models are easily disrupted by
    noise and deviations from theoretical assumptions. 4.1.2. ML-based approaches
    An example of an ML-based solution to the issue of model brittleness can be found
    in a paper by Jaekel et al. (Jaekel and Scholz, 2015). This work uses Self-Organizing
    Maps (SOM), an unsupervised variant of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for
    the detection of failures in dexterous manipulators for On-Orbit Servicing (OOS).
    SOM manages to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of incoming data in a simulated environment
    and thus show increased robustness to input variations with respect to traditional
    methods. They can also deal with uncertainties and noise in values. A dexterous
    manipulator on a maintenance satellite captures a client spacecraft having 7 degrees
    of freedom. They inject sensor failures, including sensor outage and drift, during
    arm operations and the results show that SOMs are a robust approach as temporary
    fluctuations in the sensor, outliers and peaks do not unnecessarily stop the current
    operation. But the computational load is relatively high and needs to be optimized
    to reduce system reaction time. The authors suggest improving the precision and
    speed of the method by adding more information from redundant sensors. Ranasinghe
    et al. provides a comprehensive analysis of FDIR (Ranasinghe et al., 2022). Fuertes
    et al. (Fuertes et al., 2018) discuss ML-based fault detection using NOSTRADAMUS,
    an algorithm developed by the Centre National des Ãtudes Spatiales (CNES). NOSTRADAMUS
    uses a One-Class - Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), a common algorithm used to
    detect outliers, to detect the presence of an anomaly in telemetry data. NOSTRADAMUS
    runs on the ground segment, analyzing telemetry as it is downlinked from the satellite.
    The performance of NOSTRADAMUS is compared to algorithms inspired by Novelty Detection
    (ESOC), Project Sybil (Ivano Verzola et al., 2016), and ATHMoS (DLR) (OâMeara
    et al., 2016). NOSTRADAMUS is the best option because it has a 100 % detection
    rate and the minimum false alarm rate (5 percent). The Novelty-inspired algorithms
    show the best performance of false alarm reduction, with 85 percent of valid detections
    and fewer than 1 % of false alerts. CNES is working on an on-board version of
    this algorithm, as well as on extensions to the ground-based variant for processing
    of multiple telemetry variables based on dictionary learning approaches (Pilastre,
    2020). In conversations during their collaboration with this project, CNES teams
    signaled that explainability was a crucial aspect of any technique. Being able
    to understand the features of input data that signal a fault lets the operational
    teams understand the context of their satellite and know which actions must be
    taken to remedy the situation - this is comparable in value to being able to detect
    the anomaly in the first place. Project Sybil is a collaborative effort by DLR''s
    Columbus Flight Control team, ESA''s Advanced Mission Concept Section, and Ludwig
    Maximilians Universitat to apply an outlier identification algorithm to the Columbus
    telemetry database. After data segmentation and computation of its respective
    characteristics, it uses the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
    with Noise (DBSCAN) technique to preprocess the data. It is an unsupervised clustering
    method that divides data into a variable number of clusters based on their relative
    distances. Following this grouping, clusters with less than 5 % of the population
    data are discarded on the assumption that they may indicate a non-nominal working
    mode in the learning dataset. Project Sybill allows for higher mission performance
    by reducing downtime caused by onboard system failures. 4.2. Fault diagnosis Fault
    detection identifies the presence of faults and performance degradation, while
    fault diagnosis identifies the root causes of these events. 4.2.1. Classical approaches
    Though traditionally, fault diagnosis has been achieved by human operators at
    the ground through comparison with hardcoded hand-tuned thresholds. It is difficult
    to deal with large amounts of data using this approach. Iverson et al. (Iverson,
    2008) point out that for efficient utilization of the data, there is a need for
    an autonomous approach that eliminates the necessity of human experts for diagnosis.
    4.2.2. ML-based approaches Ricks et al. (Ricks, 2021) examine fault detection
    and identification for a satellite Electrical Power System (EPS) testbed using
    BNs compiled to arithmetic circuits. BNs can be used to model partial knowledge
    and uncertainty by identifying the system state based on probabilistic relationships
    between a set of system variables at a certain instance in time (MeÎ², 2019). The
    proposed methods work for complex systems exhibiting both continuous and discrete
    behavior. The discussed techniques can handle abrupt continuous faults particularly
    well, which often pose problems. For example, a nominal value region is not enough
    to detect offset faults if they are small enough - the paper uses cumulative sums
    to deal with these. Additionally, âstuckâ faults may be difficult to detect in
    low-noise conditions since fluctuations might be infrequent. The authors employ
    a tunable time interval which will mark the sensor as working abnormally after
    it expires without the readings having made any change. Different types of nodes,
    modeling different behaviours, are grouped to defined sensors and components,
    which in turn are assembled to create the entire EPS functional FDIR structure.
    BNs have also been used by Schumann et al. (Schumann et al., 2011) to detect onboard
    failures and perform diagnoses. A Software and Sensor Health Management (SSHM)
    system is developed for a simple GNC structure of a small satellite using BNs
    that collect data from hardware sensors, software quality signals, software status
    signals and data from the operating system in order to determine whether any failures
    exist, what the most likely causes are, and to provide a statistically sound quality
    measure of the diagnose. The developed SSHM system requires no modification to
    the satellite subsystems for which it performs FDIR - it just uses the sensor
    data outputs. That way, model-level and code-level Verification & Validation can
    be performed independently on the SSHM system to certify that the rate of false
    positives and false negatives is below a selected threshold. This SSHM, applied
    to a simple GNC system, was able to detect and diagnose both hardware and software
    problems successfully. Nevertheless, it remains a simplistic case and more research
    into hierarchical SSHM systems is required in order to apply them to large-scale
    BNs. The approach can further be extended to failures that are not modeled and
    unexpected and due to arising behavior. Although not specifically related to space
    systems, Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2018) reviews the existing techniques for ML-based
    fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. In general, it presents useful research
    and conclusions which we consider can be applied to reaction wheels in the AOCS
    subsystem of spacecraft. K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) is the simplest method reviewed,
    which exhibits ease of implementation but necessitates careful fine-tuning and
    large computation and storage space. The authors cite BNsâ strong prior assumptions
    as the biggest shortcoming of this family of algorithms while mentioning as main
    advantages that it possesses a clear physical explanation of how it detects faults
    and its reduced storage space requirement. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is also
    reviewed, and its high-dimension accuracy is highlighted, even if the physical
    meaning is obscured, unlike with the previous two techniques. Finally, DL techniques
    have the potential to learn from data up to a degree of complexity much higher
    than any of the other techniques without the need for a manually crafted feature
    extractor. However, the main drawback of this approach is the need for large samples
    in order to train the network, which is difficult to obtain unless the spacecraft
    is a new iteration of previously flown models for which data already exists. If
    the satellite is a one-off, this can only be obtained in an approximate manner
    by creating a simulation environment. The authors underline that future ML-based
    fault diagnosis methods should not be purely data-driven but should consider possible
    failure mechanisms, system models and prior knowledge in general to increase diagnostic
    performance. Voss (Voss, 2019) explores the use of DL for fault detection and
    isolation in a simulation environment. A NN is developed, trained offline and
    tested to detect and isolate single faults in the reaction wheels, GPS, star tracker
    and magnetometer subsystems, as well as two simultaneous faults. A case study
    with PROBA-V mission parameters is also performed for the AOCS subsystem only.
    The implemented system yielded mixed results: while some subsystems have a near-perfect
    performance, the network fared poorly regarding others, namely misalignment faults.
    Also, fault isolation was much more reliable than fault detection. On top of that,
    a large dataset is required for this system to work, so creating a simulation
    environment is mandatory, especially for one-off spacecraft, to acquire enough
    data for adequate network training. This study also assumes there is enough electrical
    and computing power available on the satellite to run this deep-learning-based
    solution. We overview techniques for reducing resource consumption of deep neural
    models and other techniques in section 6. 4.3. Recovery In FDIR, recovery entails
    reconfiguring the problematic element and/or the entire spacecraft to restore
    normal system behaviour (Jaekel and Scholz, 2015). 4.3.1. Classical approaches
    Traditional FDIR is able to respond to predefined events by selecting a recovery
    path from the available set of options. However, the status of the system and
    its environment can exhibit various kinds of uncertain behavior due to their dependence
    on the internal subsystem, component reliability factors, external environment
    factors (e.g., illumination conditions, thermal, radiation) and on system-environment
    interactions (e.g., resource utilization profiles, stress factors, degradation
    profiles) (MeÎ², 2019). Due to these uncertainties, the system and its environment
    cannot be completely observed by traditional FDIR concepts that pose limitations
    to autonomous isolation and recovery (MeÎ², 2019). For example, Mars Express lost
    six months of operational hours due to a non-resolvable memory problem that forced
    it into safe mode repeatedly (Jaekel and Scholz, 2015). 4.3.2. ML-based approaches
    Raiteri et al. (Codetta-Raiteri and Portinale, 2015) discuss the use of Dynamic
    Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to address issues like partial observability, uncertain
    system evolution and system-environment interaction, as well as the prediction
    and mitigation of imminent failures. The BNs do not model the relationship between
    variables at previous points in time. DBNs are an extension to BNs that refer
    to past values of certain variables to express dynamic aspects of the system over
    discrete time (MeÎ², 2019). The approach is applied by Raiteri et al. (Codetta-Raiteri
    and Portinale, 2015) onto the power subsystem of a simulated ExoMars rover, by
    simulating different failure scenarios. The DBNs can infer whether the system
    is currently in a normal, anomalous or failed state. On detection of a failure,
    a suitable recovery plan is suggested. A preventive recovery plan may be proposed
    in case an anomaly is inferred. The FDIR presented in this paper also has the
    capability of performing a prognostic state estimation that can also be used for
    preventive recovery. The proposed approach has been implemented in an on-board
    software architecture called Anomaly Resolution and Prognostic Health Management
    for Autonomy (ARPHA). The results show that DBNs are suitable for failure situations
    requiring autonomous (preventive and reactive) recovery. AIKO Technologies have
    developed a software library, MiRAGE, that can enable the spacecraft to make autonomous
    decisions for processing telemetry and payload. The library is meant to be installed
    on the satellites to enable functionalities such as event detection, predictive
    maintenance and autonomous re-planning. 4.4. Fault avoidance Fault avoidance methods
    are concerned with preventing the occurrence of faults. 4.4.1. Classical approaches
    FDIR in past missions worked under the notion that a fault is detected and then
    the algorithm will react, according to predefined scenarios.(Jalilian et al.,
    2017, Olive, 2010). Regarding ML-based models, one of the bottlenecks to having
    an on-board failure avoidance system is that the models are trained on the ground
    with limited data that does not represent actual behavior in space. This gives
    rise to the requirement of real-time access to the data, which can be used to
    represent multiple onboard scenarios, and closely represents spacecraft behavior
    during the mission. 4.4.2. ML-based approaches Especially notable in the context
    of ML-enabled fault avoidance is the work of LabrÃ¨che et al.(Georges et al., 2021)
    discussing the OrbitAI experiment onboard the OPS-SAT spacecraft. OPS-SAT is a
    special ESA satellite deployed with the scope of being a testbench for novel software
    technologies in orbit. OrbitAI uses ML techniques to obtain intelligent FDIR algorithms
    enabling the onboard camera to avoid direct exposure to sunlight. Interestingly
    the ML model used is trained on-board, rather than offline. The model is trained
    with five training algorithms tested of those natively provided in the MochiMochi
    library (olanleed, 2021) for online ML training: Adam, RDA, AROW, SCW, and NHERD.
    When using the figure of merit of balanced accuracy, only one model appears to
    achieve values significantly different from 0.5: the AROW algorithm in three-dimensional
    input space. 4.5. Recommendations FDIR innovation has been applied mainly to deep
    space missions, which need a higher degree of autonomy due to their long communication
    delays inherent to the long distances traveled. However, the analysis of the literature
    suggests that ML in EO FDIR has promising prospects. The approach can be extended
    to diagnose failures that are not modeled, unexpected and due to arising behavior,
    which offers a great advantage in overcoming the model brittleness issues of traditional
    FDIR. ML-based fault detection and diagnosis solutions can be integrated alongside
    the traditional FDIR of the satellite. But ML-based recovery is virtually unexplored,
    and much research is needed in this domain. The majority of the work in this field
    concerns BNs, while other research avenues remain largely unexplored, such as
    ANNs and DL. As it would be shown and discussed in Section 6, power and computational
    resources remain a big concern for ML-based FDIR, especially for small satellites.
    The benefits of ML-based FDIR can be further researched to be implemented in future
    EO satellites to perform FDIR on the AOCS subsystem, GNC, On-Board Data Handling,
    Power subsystem, and detection of faulty sensors. 5. Machine learning in Earth
    observation on-board image processing 5.1. On-board image processing Clouds cover
    66 % of the Earthâs surface and are an obstacle when observing the Earthâs surface
    in certain wavelengths such as visible light. Removal of clouds from satellite
    images is an important preprocessing phase for most of the applications in remote
    sensing. Researchers have explored various forms of Cloud detection like âCloud
    / No cloudâ, âSnow / Cloudâ, and âThin Cloud / Thick Cloudâ, using various approaches
    of ML and classical algorithms (Mahajan and Fataniya, 2020). Cloud detection/filtering
    can be used alongside novelty detection. Novelty detection is to detect unexpected
    features and it is especially important while looking into new environments. Good
    cloud detection algorithms are necessary to optimize bandwidth and memory usage
    in EO missions (Z. Zhang et al., 2019) and before the implementation of segmentation
    and object detection methods. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated
    excellent performance in various visual recognition problems such as image classification
    and enable accurate onboard cloud detection in small satellites. With the increase
    in EO missions coupled with high-resolution modern sensors, there is an increase
    in bandwidth requirement that leads to the need to utilize new techniques to manage
    the bandwidth resources efficiently. 5.1.1. Classical approaches In the majority
    of missions, all images taken are transmitted to the ground, which requires a
    significant amount of bandwidth. Traditionally, data collection is done by specifying
    in advance where and when to take the measurements. Based on the content of the
    data, there is no mechanism to tailor what is downlinked. (Srivastava, 2003, Vladimirova
    and Atek, 2002). Other common approaches include novelty detection based on spectral
    contrast, radiance spatial or temporal contrast. (Shaw and Burke, 2003) But these
    methods are better used for dark grounds like vegetation or deserts as clouds
    contrast in color compared to them. Furthermore, these methods rely on manually
    chosen thresholds, which are time-consuming to find and sometimes brittle. (Arechiga
    et al., 2018). Whereas spatial coherence is a better method of cloud detection
    in areas with little contrast with the clouds (ice sheets). NNs have also been
    shown to have greater flexibility with classifying indistinct classes like clouds
    on snow. 5.1.2. ML-based approaches to on-board image processing For cloud detection,
    Zhang et al. (Z. Zhang et al., 2019) propose a lightweight DNN based on U-Net.
    For performance estimation of the proposed method, training and testing of the
    red, green, blue and infrared waveband images from Landsat-8 were used. The lightweight
    DNN is based on U-Net and obtained better overall accuracy while reaching the
    state-of-art inference speed by applying the LeGall-5/3 wavelet transform on the
    dataset which compresses the dataset and accelerates the network for on-board
    use. Zhang et al. experimental results illustrate that the proposed model maintains
    high accuracy after four-level compression (Z. Zhang et al., 2019). They reduce
    processing time from 5.408 s per million pixels to 0.12 s per million pixels,
    and average memory cost by around 30 %. The suggested method takes advantage of
    established image compression systems in satellites to provide a good chance of
    onboard cloud identification based on DL, hence enhancing downlink data transmission
    efficiency and lowering memory costs. On compressed datasets, U-Net gives improved
    accuracy. In addition, the U-Net framework demonstrated tremendous promise for
    pixel-by-pixel categorisation of remote sensing datasets (Z. Zhang et al., 2019).

    work on the detection of clouds in the H2020 EO-Alert project framework. However,
    the EO-Alert project aims at keeping images of clouds and enriching them with
    alert profiles in case of severe storms for weather broadcasting. The algorithm
    used is ML-based Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and is embedded in a modular
    image processing pipeline. Currently, tests of the pipeline are performed in Matlab
    and are ported on hardware to be flown to space. Srivastava et al. (Srivastava,
    2003) suggested using Kernel methods for better onboard discovery computation
    of cloud detection over snow and ice. This paper proposes a Kernel method that
    can be used for clustering and classifying images on board any satellite. The
    paper discusses a novel variant of the Probabilistic Kernel (P-Kernels) with a
    mixture of Gaussian and spherical covariance structures. It is very sensitive
    to even the smallest changes as it assumes all observations are independent. The
    results showed great promise, with clouds being differentiated much better from
    Greenland ice sheets compared to the Gaussian and Gaussian mixture models. Giuffrida
    et al. (Giuffrida et al., 2020) (Giuffrida et al., 2022) discuss a CNN deployed
    on the PhiSat-1 reconfigurable nanosatellite to analyze imagery from its Hyperscout-2
    payload and select images eligible for transmission to the ground. It is implemented
    on-board the ESA Phisat-I mission to classify cloud-covered images and clear ones.
    Only images with less than 70 % cloudiness are transmitted to the ground. The
    network is trained and tested against an extracted dataset from the Sentinel-2
    mission, which was appropriately pre-processed to emulate the Hyperscout-2 hyperspectral
    sensor. On the test set, 92 % of accuracy is achieved with 1 % of False Positives
    (FP). The results showed a power consumption of 1.8 W, requiring memory of 2.1
    MB, keeping within the power and the memory constraints. (Del Rosso et al., 2021)
    showcase the use of CNNs on multispectral data to detect volcanic eruptions on-board
    a satellite. Onboard detection of disaster events allows prioritizing their downlink
    and thus optimising response times, which can translate into saved lives. Moreover,
    they have released the dataset used for training, a step the rest of the industry
    should imitate if rapid progress is to be encouraged. (Spiller et al., 2022, Thangavel
    et al., 2023, Thangavel et al., 2023 Thangavel et al., 2022 2022a, 2022b) showcase
    the use of CNNs on hyperspectral data to detect wildfire on-board a satellite.
    Other solutions that have not flown yet and are in the concept phase have been
    developed. Maskey et al. (Maskey and Cho, 2020) proposed an ultralight CNN algorithm
    called CubeSatNet, that prioritizes quality data over quantity without changing
    the constraints of size, power, volume, downlink and pointing requirements imposed
    by a 1U CubeSat. The algorithm is trained over 48,000 augmented images from CubeSats
    and validated against 12,000 augmented images from CubeSats to classify images
    as âbadâ when cloudy, sunburnt, facing space or saturated. Images are classified
    as âgoodâ in all other cases. If in orbit, the algorithm would select only âgoodâ
    images to be downlinked and discard images that are covered in clouds or too bright
    or dark. Trained on BIRDS3 satellite images, the algorithm reportedly has an accuracy
    of 90 % and can cut operation time by about 2/3 while significantly improving
    the quality of images received. Murray (Ireland, 2019) proposed a concept of on-board
    processing with two cameras: the nadir-looking camera performs the standard observation,
    whereas a forward-looking camera observes if clouds are coming in the trajectory
    of the satellite. A neural net classification grid is used to identify clouds
    and an algorithm then decides when to capture images with the nadir looking. This
    approach would be oriented towards CubeSats. CastaÃ±o et al. (Ricard CastaÃ±o et
    al., 2007) trained an SVM for estimating the opacity of atmospheric dust and water
    ice on Mars on data from the THEMIS camera mounted on board the Odyssey mission.
    The authors use both a regular SVM and a reduced-set SVM. The reduced-set SVM
    is trained on a reduced synthetic dataset maximizing the similarity of the reduced-set
    SVM to the regular SVM. The reduced amount of support vectors decreases compute
    requirements. They then test both the full-size SVM and reduced-set SVM on flight
    software, showing the capability of such software to run the proposed algorithms.
    The authors mention two challenges related to the analysis accuracy of onboard
    Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) data.
    Firstly, as the onboard data is not calibrated, the deployed models must be robust
    to significant noise. Secondly, the camera''s response function can gradually
    increase or decrease its values due to temperature fluctuations, even when there
    is no change in actual value. The authors suggest characterizing the operation
    of the algorithms in an environment as close as possible to that of the spacecraft.
    Lastly, the Autonomous and Reactive Image Chain (CIAR) project from IRT Saint
    ExupÃ©ry demonstrated cloud segmentation on board the operational test-bed satellite
    OPS-SAT in 2021 (FrÃ©dÃ©ric FÃ©rÃ©sin et al., 2021). Fig. 5 showcases a visualization
    of their results. Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download : Download

    ML-based approaches to novelty detection Wagstaff et al. (Wagstaff et al., 2017)
    show the benefits of reduced downlink data when performing cloud detection and
    filtering for EO missions. Cloud detection is demonstrated using Random Decision
    Forests (RDFs) and Bayesian Thresholding (BT), while a third saliency-based algorithm
    is used for novelty detection onboard EO-1. The RDF method analyzes a window of
    values around the pixel for classifying the pixels. In contrast, the BT independently
    performs the classification of each pixel. BT uses the difference in particular
    wavelengths between dark surface materials and bright cloudy regions. The novelty
    detection algorithm identifies such regions within an image that may contain new
    features. EO-1â²s primary science instrument is Hyperion. Itâs an Imaging Spectrometer
    capable of data collection with high Spatial and Spectral resolution. Using data
    from previous mission phases, both cloud detection algorithms were trained to
    drop useless images from the telemetry downstream. The performance of the algorithms
    has been evaluated onboard over a five-month period from November 2016 through
    March 2017. In comparison to ground testing, the on-board performance showed similar
    or better results on a diverse collection of targets. Both RDFs and BT reached
    an accuracy of more than 90 %. However, in real-time, the RDFs were faster. The
    novelty detection was able to detect new features in remote locations such as
    small lakes and buildings; hence, such images could be given priority for the
    downlink. Such methods must be able to successfully operate on board with limited
    resources while posing a minimum risk to the overall spacecraft. With the advancement
    in computing capabilities, more complex models offering better accuracy can be
    used onboard future EO missions. Chien et al. (Chien et al., 2017) present the
    results of the IPEX, which was based on a CubeSat that did fly from December 2013
    to January 2015 and validated autonomous operations for the computation and generation
    of product onboard the platform hosting the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI)
    mission concept''s Intelligent Payload Module. IPEX was used as a testbed for
    on-board image classification, which was accomplished with the help of machine
    learning-based random decision forest algorithms. In comparison to earlier missions,
    the solution was improved by using an ensemble of several trees to increase the
    classifier''s reliability through statistical regularization without the requirement
    for explicit tree pruning. Furthermore, the system examines spatial neighborhoods
    in each image rather than single pixels to integrate local morphology and texture.
    By classifying every 10th pixel and the vertical and horizontal directions and
    filling in the rest with nearest-neighbor interpolation, runtime was reduced.
    The IPEX classifiers are trained before launch using only four hand-labelled photos
    from a high-altitude balloon mission that used the same type of camera as IPEX.
    This is a very fascinating point. According to the researchers, it was the first
    time that an ML system was trained on a suborbital mission and then effectively
    used in orbit. IPEX also experimented with an unsupervised method for identifying
    photographs with potentially intriguing content, which would be used in conjunction
    with supervised learning. To extract relevant regions for downlink in captured
    imagery, computer vision visual salience software was used. To work with CubeSat''s
    limited resources, the program developed a simple pixel-based measurement of visual
    salience for grayscale images with the local context. To select the five most
    important parts within the image, the method is applied to a down sampled version
    of the image using a 32 Ã 32-pixel window. The pipeline is finished with thumbnails
    of important regions and their salience scores, which are saved and made available
    for downlink and on-the-ground analysis. If necessary, full-resolution images
    can also be downlinked to ground stations. 5.1.4. Recommendations With the strict
    limitation on bandwidth, onboard filtering of useless data enables sending data
    to the ground with minimum compromise on image quality and the need for human
    intervention for decision-making. The results of ML algorithms can be improved
    in terms of accuracy and precision with the availability of newly generated data.
    5.2. Object/image classification Image classification is a task of extracting
    information on the basis of objects in the images instead of individual pixels,
    where âobjectsâ are referred to as meaningful scene components that distinguish
    an image (Deepan and Sudha, 2020). 5.2.1. Classical approaches While current methods
    do extensively apply ML algorithms to great success, image classification is more
    often done on the ground instead of onboard a satellite. (Shaw and Burke, 2003).
    5.2.2. ML-based approaches Arechiga et al. (Arechiga et al., 2018) give an example
    of an on-board processing application where a CNN architecture is used for object
    classification and trained using satellite imagery of Planetâs Open California
    dataset. Nvidia Jetson TX2 is used for implementing this application. The authors
    suggest that more research can be done so that the application can be enhanced
    to classify more objects. Machine intelligence is used to perform onboard analysis
    of EO tasks such as hazard analysis (e.g., wildfire and flood detection), target
    detection, area monitoring, and weather forecasting (Manning et al., 2018). On
    MODIS (Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data, NASA Goddard researchers
    employed machine learning to detect wildfires. In practice, CNNs are used to perform
    two tasks: training and inference. The process of âlearningâ the ideal set of
    weights that maximizes the accuracy of the desired task is referred to as training
    (e.g., image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation). It''s a
    computationally difficult task that''s frequently aided by Graphics Processing
    Unit (GPU). The inference is the process of making decisions based on new data
    using a trained model (with no parameters changed). The inference is a less computationally
    intensive method that has been carried out on Central Processing Unit (CPU), GPUs,
    and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). 5.2.3. Recommendations Similar to onboard
    cloud detection, moving object classification and detection onboard satellite
    platforms allow operators to reduce the load of ground-satellite communications
    links. EO Operators can leverage the huge and quickly expanding research field
    of computer vision. The high-level information gained by using object classification
    can then be used for other tasks, like dynamic mission replanning. 5.3. On-board
    image compression New, complicated onboard sensors can quickly saturate communication
    transceiver downlink bandwidth as well as onboard data storage capacity. Image
    compression codecs that are more efficient are becoming a need for spacecraft
    and can greatly lower the amount of data communicated or stored. However, while
    designing a tradeoff mission, itâs also important to think about whether these
    are computationally intensive and require quick processing to keep sensor data
    rates up. 5.3.1. Classical approaches Systems used a range of lossless and lossy
    compression algorithms to compress data in spaceborne activities (Giuffrida et
    al., 2022; âImage Data Compression,â 2021; âLossless Data Compression,â 2020).
    Where the system bandwidth is too low to support lossless compression, when the
    science value is not compromised by lossy compressionâs distortion, or when other
    sensors that do not play a role in primary data products are included, lossy compression
    is frequently used. An example of this last case can be scene-context cameras.
    5.3.2. ML-based approaches Goodwill et al. (Goodwill et al., 2020) proposed an
    ML-based solution to achieve good reconstruction fidelity after lossy compression.
    The algorithm, CNNâ Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), makes use of a hybrid
    approach combining CNNs and JPEG Compression. The image is fed to a 3-layer CNN
    in the encoder to obtain a compact image representation, which is then encoded
    with JPEG. Based on previous work, the encoder is denoted by ComCNN and learns
    a compact image representation that is half the size of the original image. In
    the decoder, the resulting image is upsampled to the original size and decoded
    with a deeper 20-layer CNN, which reconstructs the original image by learning
    a residual image and adding it to the upsampled image. On an image dataset obtained
    from STP-H5-CSP compressed to the same file size, experimental results for CNN-JPEG
    demonstrate a 23.5 percent and 33.5 percent gain in Peak Signal to Noise Ratio
    (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) over conventional JPEG, respectively.
    At a fixed PSNR, CNN-JPEG increased the average compression ratio by 1.74 times
    on the same dataset. It''s also worth noting that the encoding segment of CNN-JPEG
    in TensorFlow (TF) Lite, when run on the Zynq-7020â²s Cortex-A9 cores, provided
    an average execution time of 16.75 s utilizing a single thread, according to the
    research. Using the TF Lite interpreter to parallelize operations was reportedly
    far from ideal linear speedup. Authors also showed that leveraging the Zynq-7020
    FPGA resources through SDSoC for hardware acceleration helped decrease the average
    execution time of the CNN-JPEG encoder to 2.293 s, with a 7.30 speedup over the
    single-threaded TF Lite solution and 6.87 times speedup over the single-threaded
    TF Lite solution. Vladimirova et al. (Vladimirova and Atek, 2002) discuss the
    development of a lossless compression method without the drawbacks of low compression
    ratios using predictive NNs, coupled with integral wavelet transforms and the
    Peano-Hilbert (PH) Scan algorithm. This is then benchmarked against the Context-Based,
    Adaptive, Lossless Image Codec (CALIC) Method using various image datasets. The
    image is first sent through the Integral Wavelet Transform (IWT)to produce a de-correlated
    image, which is mapped, and a PH scan is performed after which the NN (a two-layer,
    4x106 Ã 1) scans and allocates a probability distribution for the next incoming
    value. On the tested data sets, using only the NN method achieved an average compression
    ratio of 2.530, compared to the CALIC method which achieved a ratio of 1.806.
    Introducing the PH scan brought an 8.5 % improvement compared to the CALIC method
    at 2.747. The IWT + PH + NN method overall achieved an improvement of 13.1 % compression
    ratio over the CALIC method. The paper proposes potential applications of the
    algorithm in previewing a satellite image before a full image is transferred to
    assess the image''s features and would prevent bad images from being sent, such
    as those affected by clouds or images suffering from other distortions. Cai et
    al. (Cai et al., 2003) proposed a novel Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) image
    data compression method. The method is called feature indexing where specific
    features are assigned to a data index system generated by DNNs. The whole program
    is then uploaded to onboard hardware and it stores it as a dictionary for reference.
    The On-Board Computer (OBC) runs a feature isolation program, identifies features,
    and creates a resultant dataset of pure indices based on the directory. This data
    set is then transmitted with the location data and then is decoded on the ground.
    Achieves a compression level of 99.17 % and works far better than standard wavelet
    compression methods. The method was tested against the LIDAR data of the Space
    Shuttle program and achieved the above-mentioned results. 5.3.3. Recommendations
    Exploiting lossy compression to ease downlink clearly represents a path to be
    explored. The work by Goodwill et al. (Goodwill et al., 2020) also emphasizes
    the importance of advancement in the field of hardware acceleration and System
    on a Chip (SoC) FPGAs. Indeed, on-board inference of CNNs is computationally expensive
    for space platforms. Further advancements can possibly support the application
    of more complex algorithms even in constrained environments. 6. Machine learning
    in resource-constrained Earth observation platforms This section addresses the
    topic of ML in resource-constrained spacecraft performing EO tasks. These methods
    represent a powerful set of enabling technologies, relevant both for the emerging
    interest in small satellites and to preserve the operativity of large platforms
    experiencing failures or operating with shared resources. Moreover, the consistent
    technological lag of space hardware makes considerations about reduced available
    SWaP almost always necessary when redeploying architectures developed for Earth-based
    applications into orbit. Within the scope of this work, the constraint on resource
    availability will be limited to on-the-edge computational and sensing capabilities,
    and not extended to the data. It is also out of the scope of the section to address
    scheduling approaches, which optimize the availability of resources to multiple
    subsystems or users. This variability, however, can be also seen as a source of
    constraint over the available budgets. We investigate two ways in which this adaptation
    to technological limitations can be implemented: optimization of the AI architecture
    itself, and optimization of the interplay between the model and the hardware this
    operates on. In general, resource-constrained platforms it is necessary to maintain
    a holistic view of the architecture of the software, the hardware, and the data
    at play. It is worth noting that another emerging technological field presenting
    similar constraints to the space sector is represented by Internet-of-Things (Lane
    et al., 2015), where the target platforms for AI are small, low-power devices.
    6.1. AI architecture optimization 6.1.1. Pruning Pruning is the operation of removing
    or zeroing parameters of a NN model, thus reducing the networkâs size (Han et
    al., 2015). This process is generally performed by associating scores with the
    networkâs elements during training in order to select the ones to prune. The lighter
    model is then further trained and can be iteratively re-pruned several times.
    Multiple pruning strategies exist, such as varying the number and nature of items
    pruned, the number of iterations performed or changing the scoring criteria (Blalock
    et al., 2020). There are also other emerging pruning paradigms that do not rely
    on an iterative process (H. Wang et al., 2021) (Frankle et al., 2021). Pruningâs
    main trade-off is to increase computational efficiency at the cost of quality/accuracy
    and increased training complexity. The objective is to leverage compression rates
    of 4, 8 or even 32 while costing at worst only a few percent of accuracy (Blalock
    et al., 2020). Performing pruning along this objective remains a delicate task
    as literature demonstrates that keeping good performances is dependent on the
    pruning method. The main challenge of implementing pruning is thus to determine
    and test which pruning methods to use in order to achieve the required compression
    while keeping acceptable performances for a representative type of datasets. Although
    the lack of standards in evaluation impedes the comparison of the multiple existing
    studies, they all advertise significant compressing at low accuracy cost, including
    several algorithms confirmed by multiple papers (Blalock et al., 2020). Pruning
    has been successfully applied in many image processing use cases but has also
    been proven on voice processing (He et al., 2014), credit classification (Tang
    et al., 2018), and multiple other types of datasets (Lazarevic and Obradovic,
    2001). Additional engineering and more complex training on the ground in order
    to significantly reduce the onboard execution constraints make pruning an attractive
    trade-off and a strong technological enabler of NN implementation in space. Pruning
    is now developed enough to have documented implementation and examples in ML frameworks
    such as TF (âPruning in Keras example | TensorFlow Model Optimization,â 2022).
    So far, pruning has been used as part of complex NN applications for space but
    only on the ground with applications such as image classification (Browne et al.,
    2020, Castelluccio et al., 2015, Kavzoglu and Mather, 1999, Maggiori et al., 2017).
    There are some applications aiming towards on-board implementations like remote
    sensing image classification (Pitsis et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2020), vehicle
    detection in satellite images (Tan et al., 2020) and image anomaly detection (Ma
    et al., 2019). Unfortunately, the authors were unable to find documented evidence
    of a pruned NN that flew on a space mission. 6.1.2. Filter compression and matrix
    factorization In its section concerning âconvolutional filter compression and
    matrix factorization,â the paper by Goel et al. (Goel et al., 2020) presents methods
    to adapt neural networks to low-power platforms by operating at a layerâs level.
    The distinction operated between the two distinguishes between the types of network
    elements that are being optimized. Neural Networks can be algebraically represented
    as n-dimensional matrices known as tensors. Matrix factorization approaches reduce
    the complexity of these underlying tensorial structures, to obtain compressed
    networks without significant loss of accuracy. Filter compression methods, on
    the other hand, reduce the number of parameters in the network architecture by
    acting on the structure of filters in the so-called convolutional layers. In particular,
    Goel et al., observe that filter compression methods are capable of achieving
    state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision, albeit at times at a high computational
    cost. As computer vision tasks are essential in EO operations, this class of methods
    appears to be the most significant within the scope of this paper. Two architectures
    emerging as relevant for filter compression are SqueezeNet (Iandola et al., 2016)
    and MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017). Both these architectures have found applications
    in the EO community. For example, modified SqueezeNets have been used by Haikel
    (Haikel, 2018), Alswayed et al. (Asmaa et al., 2020) and Alhichri et al. (Alhichri
    et al., 2018)for the classification of remote sensing images (both in drone and
    satellite images). In particular, Alswayed et al. report results comparable to
    or outperforming the state of the art at the time of publication. Poortinga et
    al. have used a MobileNet-based architecture to map sugarcanes in satellite data
    of Thailand (Poortinga et al., 2021), obtaining significant accuracy for the task.
    Zhang et al. (B. Zhang et al., 2019) also have used an architecture capitalizing
    on MobileNet, reporting results outperforming the state of the art at the time.
    Similarly, Yu et al. (Yu et al., 2020) present a MobileNet-based method to classify
    remote sensing imagery and report outperforming many state-of-the-art models while
    requiring a smaller amount of training data. In their report paper, Hoeser et
    al. (Hoeser et al., 2020) note that: âIt is important to note the small group
    of six items which use MobileNets, of which five were published in 2019â. They
    describe an onset of interest in parameter efficient models with high accuracy
    and they prove that such models can compete in Earth observation studies. 6.1.3.
    Architecture search Neural Architecture Search (NAS) refers to a set of tools
    and processes for the automatic generation of optimal architectures for an ANN.
    NAS is a specific instance of automated machine learning (AutoML), the process
    of automating the overall ML construction process (He et al., 2021). As shown
    by Chan et. al (Chan et al., 2018), this process can be specialized to address
    a constraint on available resources. Seminal developments in NAS emerged in late
    2016, from the work of Zoph and Le (Zoph and Le, 2017) and Baker et al. (Baker
    et al., 2017). In a survey on the subject, Elsken et al. (Elsken et al., 2019)
    report three key parameters to operate a classification of NAS processes. These
    are: â¢ Search space, â¢ Search strategy, â¢ Performance estimation strategy. Being
    an approach to adapt the heavy computational cost of NN to resource-constrained
    platforms, NAS has naturally found application in many space-related use cases.
    EO, there has been quite a research on hyperspectral images classification using
    NAS, with development performed by Liang et al. (Liang et al., 2020) have employed
    NAS (and pruning) to detect aircraft in remote sensing images. Mobile Neural Architecture
    Search (MNAS) (Tan et al., 2019) is a probable candidate in implementing NAS to
    EO satellite inference on the edge application. 6.1.4. Knowledge transfer and
    distillation In Knowledge Transfer (KT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) a small,
    lightweight network is trained to reproduce the behavior of a large, computationally
    intensive network without having to duplicate the architecture of the latter fully.
    This leads to small networks both providing results comparable to those of large
    networks and deployable on resource-constrained platforms. According to the paper
    of Goel et al. (Goel et al., 2020), in KT the smaller network is trained using
    data labeled by the larger network (defined as âsynthetically labeled dataâ by
    Ba and Caruana (Ba and Caruana, 2013)), while in KD a small network (student)
    is trained by a large network (teacher) to replicate the latterâs output. Within
    the scope of this section, it also appears relevant to discuss transfer learning,
    which has attracted considerable interest from the space community. De Vieilleville
    et al. (de Vieilleville et al., 2020) proposed a distillation method to perform
    DNN-mediated segmentation of EO images on board of CubeSats. In this work, they
    show that a 10 to 30-fold reduction of the free parameters of the network mediated
    through distillation leads to weakly worse performance (+5/-10 % accuracy). Similarly,
    (Chen et al., 2018) provide a detailed distillation implementation and results
    showing a strong reduction of the NN execution load while keeping a steady accuracy
    in remote sensing scene classification. (Bazzi et al., 2020) applied distillation
    for mapping irrigated areas using remote sensing data. Since 2019, self-distillating
    networks are emerging (Chen et al., 2021) with one successful implementation for
    cloud detection in remote sensing by (Chai et al., 2020) achieving 200-fold compression.
    Industrialization is not as developed as pruning as there are only a few open
    access examples of implementations but no widely developed library. Unfortunately,
    the authors were unable to find documented evidence of a distilled NN ever flown
    and used on a space mission. 6.2. Hardware acceleration Computing limitations
    are demanding to ML-based applications because of the significant amount of data
    to be processed for DL. Many NN models require high-end GPU devices to run in
    inference, and even more so during training. In deploying ML to an EO satellite,
    it is appropriate to consider the inferencing phase due to volume, power, and
    mass constraints, especially under CubeSat standards. Progress in commercially
    available off-the-shelf hardware in mobile edge computing has a progressive effect
    in finding their way to CubeSats in implementing DL algorithms for space applications
    (Kothari et al., 2020). With CPUs considered to be general-purpose computers,
    AI-specific hardware such as GPUâs, FPGA, and Application-Specific Integrated
    Circuit (ASIC) takes the center stage which is designed to accelerate the computation
    of linear algebra and specializes in performing fast and matrix multiplications
    with higher performance-per-watt ratios. Furthermore, advanced next-generation
    architecture for onboard computing which heavily depends on artificial intelligence
    is developed like Artificial Intelligence-Onboard Computing (AI-OBC) (Huq et al.,
    2018) based on distributed on-board architecture consisting of CPU, Visual Processing
    Unit (VPU), emerging AI accelerator class of microprocessor for running machine-learning
    applications to train DNN and FPGA connected through CubeSat Service Protocol
    (CSP) through which ML and training are carried out in real-time with COTS components
    to reduce cost and development time. One other form of tailored hardware optimization
    is the adoption of spiking neural networks (Kucik and Meoni, 2021) and their deployment
    on optimized hardware. This approach, which is much closer to the way the brain
    seems to function, can allow for dramatic energy savings through minimization
    of energy use during neuron activation. 6.3. Quantization / BNNs In quantized
    networks, the number of bits used to represent numbers defining a model is reduced.
    This provides a decrease of orders of magnitude in computing, memory and power
    requirements, for a comparatively low decrease in performance. Quantization may
    be applied to weights, activation functions or gradients of a network, either
    during or after training. (Guo, 2018, Qin et al., 2020, Simons and Lee, 2019).
    Quantization has been explored in research for remote sensing image segmentation
    and processing but appears to never have been flown in space. Perhaps the most
    common established quantization technique is reducing the bit-width of weights
    after training. However, very low bit widths, typically of four or less, usually
    incur heavy losses. This can be mitigated by performing model training under the
    reduced bit-width quantization, known as Quantification-Aware Training (QAT).
    Good results have been achieved with quantization, even going all the way to a
    single bit. Accuracy on par with full-precision NNs was achieved for standard
    datasets in publications such as Binary-Connect, Exclusive-NOR Network (XNOR-Net),
    and Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ) (Courbariaux et al., 2015, Rastegari et
    al., 2016, Zhu et al., 2017). Quantization of already existing NNs such as AlexNet
    (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) (Simonyan
    and Zisserman, 2015) applied to the ImageNet dataset has been carried out without
    any accuracy loss while reducing their sizes up to 50 times (Han et al., 2016).
    Quantization both before and after model training is provided today either as
    part of mainstream DL libraries (âPost-training quantization | TensorFlow Lite,â
    2022.; âQuantization â PyTorch 1.9.1 documentation,â 2022.) or third-party libraries
    such as Larq (âLarq | Binarized Neural Network development,â 2022.) and FINN (Alam
    et al., 2022) respectively. Although there exists no consensus on why quantization
    works, a candidate explanation argues that large amounts of pathway redundancy
    in NNs make the expressivity loss a minor concern. Theoretical analysis in that
    regard is still limited. Anderson and Berg (Anderson and Berg, 2017) found that
    statistical properties of the computation are kept even when a network is binarized.
    Molchanov et al. (Molchanov et al., 2017) indicate that nearly 99 % of weights
    can be pruned in certain NNs and achieved a 68-times sized reduction on VGG-like
    networks without loss of accuracy. Quantization techniques can be divided into
    two main categories: Deterministic and Stochastic. Guo classifies deterministic
    quantization methods (Guo, 2018) into: â¢ Rounding: Floating-point values are assigned
    their nearest fixed-point representation. â¢ Vector Quantization: Weights are clustered
    into groups, with the centroid of each group replacing the real weights. â¢ Quantization
    as an optimization: Here, the quantization is treated as an optimization problem,
    which involves minimizing an error function taking into account real and quantized
    weight values. Regarding stochastic quantization techniques, they separate them
    into: â¢ Random Rounding: The quantized value is obtained by sampling a discrete
    distribution parameterized by the real values themselves. â¢ Probabilistic Quantization:
    Weights are assumed to be discretely distributed, with the methods trying to estimate
    which distribution function it is. Deterministic quantization has seen extensive
    success, with rounding being the most commonly successfully employed type of quantization,
    such as Rastegari et al. (Rastegari et al., 2016) and (Polino et al., 2018), where
    a general rounding function was introduced. In particular, Binary-Connect Courbariaux
    et al. (Courbariaux et al., 2015) used binary rounding, achieving 98.8 % accuracy
    on the MNIST dataset. Also noteworthy is the use of vector quantization in Gong
    et al. (Gong et al., 2014), where a network compression ratio of 24 was obtained,
    losing only 1 % of accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. However, Stochastic quantization
    has not experienced such a resounding success, perhaps due to an over-reliance
    on statistical assumptions which are not guaranteed to hold. Quantization approaches
    may quantify several or all of the following: â¢ Weights: The action of quantizing
    weights yields a smaller network size and can accelerate the training and inference
    process. However, this comes at a price: NNs will have a harder time converging
    when training with quantized weights, and a smaller learning rate is required.
    Additionally, the gradient cannot back-propagate through discrete neurons, leading
    to the use of straight-through estimators in order to estimate them, usually with
    a high variance. â¢ Activations: The goal of quantized activations is replacing
    inner products with binary operations, reducing memory constraints since the operation
    precision is reduced, all while accelerating network training. In fact, activations
    may fill more memory than weights (Mishra et al., 2017). Note that quantized activation
    will cause what is called a âgradient mismatchâ, where the gradient of the activation
    function is different from the one obtained from the straight-through estimator
    used. â¢ Gradients: Quantizing the gradients is still a relatively new avenue of
    research in NN quantization. The main objective here is not reducing the model
    size, but aiding in distributed network training, where several computing nodes
    need to share information of the gradient values between them. The smaller the
    size of the data the nodes need to share, the faster parallel training can be
    performed. Quantized gradients need to be carried out with care since unsuitable
    implementations run the risk of causing the gradient descent algorithm not to
    converge. 7. Machine learning standardization and issues in Earth observation
    operations Interest in AI and ML has increased in the past years. Many groups
    in different industries are working on creating guidelines, best practises, and
    standards to help make sure these systems are used correctly. But the process
    is far from over, and so far, the space industry has only given us a real-world
    example of something similar. Standards, guidelines, and other documents discussed
    in this section blur the line between definitions of AI and ML (Graham et al.,
    2023). While we find this fact misleading, we have kept the original usage from
    the sources in order not to alter their message. These bodies of work aim at aiding
    ML system developers to avoid common pitfalls and problems associated with these
    systems. We provide in this section a cursory overview of what these problems
    are in order to raise awareness amongst EO platform operators. We do this so that
    the designers and operators of EO platforms are aware of what ML systems are capable
    of and are not capable of doing when it comes to making decisions that are reliable,
    intelligible, and appropriate for usage in situations with high stakes. Because
    of the high expense of these possible applications on-board a big satellite platform,
    these conditions apply to the majority of those applications. To put it another
    way, any operator who is contemplating delegating decisions regarding the success
    or failure of their mission to ML systems should make it a priority to employ
    ML systems that are reliable and can be explainable. We do this so that EO platform
    designers and operators are aware of what ML systems can and cannot do when it
    comes to taking decisions that are trustworthy, understandable, and fit for use
    in high stakes scenarios. These conditions apply to many of the potential applications
    on-board a large satellite platform, due to their cost. In other words, using
    trustworthy, explainable ML systems should be important to any operator thinking
    of charging such systems with decisions deciding the success or failure of their
    mission. 7.1. Guidelines and roadmaps International Standards by International
    Standardization Organization (ISO) committee (âISOISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 - Artificial
    intelligence,â 2017.) are currently available or under development. These standards
    and projects represent the united efforts of experts and entities in providing
    guidance and focus on the standardization of Artificial Intelligence, with currently
    more than twenty under development and six already published. We found ISO/IEC
    TR 24030:2021 to be particularly interesting as it covers 132 use cases, as well
    as the projects under development concerning Functional Safety and AI, data quality
    and AI explainability. The ISO is not alone in working on AI standardization,
    though. The Chinese Big Data Security Standards Special Working Group of the National
    Information Security Standardization Technical Committee (NISSTC) wrote the Artificial
    Intelligence Security Standardization White Paper (TÃ¶rnblom and Nadjm-Tehrani,
    2019). The focus of this White Paper ranges from the security of AI to main security
    threats, risks, and challenges. Seven recommendations have been made on the importance
    of improving a system of AI security standards, the need to speed up the development
    of standards in key areas, promoting the application of AI security standards,
    strengthening the training of AI security standardization talent, participating
    in international AI security standardization, establishing an AI high-security
    risk early warning mechanism, and improving AI security supervision support capabilities.
    Germany developed an Artificial Intelligence Standardization Roadmap (Wahlster
    and Cristoph Winterhalter, 2020), continuously updated, as a joint effort between
    DIN and DKE. The roadmap strongly supports the idea that standardization would
    improve the explainability and reliability of AI, thus favoring its application.
    In the roadmap, AI''s explainability and reliability, they deal with data reference
    models for the interoperability of AI systems, development of an AI basic security
    standard, practice-oriented initial criticality checking of AI systems. In addition,
    the work provides extensive analysis on the definition of AI as well as classification
    schemes to evaluate AI-based systems. The work is particularly interesting also
    for spotlighting issues as the risk-based assessment of applications, trustworthiness,
    ethical approach and AI application lifecycle. In addition, in each section of
    the roadmap, specific needs in the direction of standardization are pinpointed.
    The European Commission (EC) shaped a white paper (âWhite Paper on Artificial
    Intelligence,â 2020.) setting out policies to achieve the uptake of AI in the
    European Union (EU) and to address risks associated with the use of AI technology.
    Along the sections of the document, it gives particular attention to the opportunity
    to create an ecosystem of excellence. Six actions have been highlighted, among
    which: focusing on SMEs and ensuring that each member state has a digital hub
    highly specialized in AI; strengthening publicâprivate partnerships in AI, data
    and robotics; and promoting the use of AI in the public sector. An overview of
    the most significant risks is also provided, with more emphasis on ethical and
    trustworthy AI. The National Science and Technology Council from the USAâs Executive
    Office developed an AI Research Development Plan in 2016, later updated in 2019
    (Faisal DâSouza, 2019). The Plan does not define specific research agendas for
    Federal agency investments but highlights strategies to reach a given portfolio.
    While it must be noted that the utmost focus of the strategies is not on the standardization,
    strategy 4 âEnsure the Safety and Security of AI Systems'''' and Strategy 6 âMeasure
    and Evaluate AI Technologies through Standards and Benchmarksâ are covering aspects
    strictly related to standards and certifiability. It is worth mentioning great
    attention to the development of shared public datasets and open-source libraries,
    as means to keep the technological lead. Although slightly different in scope,
    as more oriented towards certification rather than standardization, it is worth
    mentioning the White Paper (Gregory Flandin et.al., 2021). The document aims at
    âsharing knowledge, identifying challenges for the certification of systems using
    ML, and fostering the research effortâ. A thorough discussion on the features
    that an ML-based system should possess to be certified is carried on, leading
    to the identification of seven challenges to tackle: probabilistic assessment,
    resilience, specificality, data quality, explainability, robustness, and verifiability.
    7.2. Issues and techniques In this section, we offer a brief discussion of the
    potential unique issues one may encounter when developing and operating a system
    that incorporates ML. Whenever possible, we discuss some current approaches to
    bridge these issues. This discussion is meant to be illustrative to the reader
    and an encouragement to explore the topics in further detail, but it attempts
    to be comprehensive on neither scope nor depth. Furthermore, the topic is under
    active research and is likely to expand in the coming years. 7.2.1. Explainability
    ML models, and particularly large models with lots of free parameters such as
    large decision trees or NNs, can act as black boxes. The process by which they
    arrive at the final output can be too complex to be directly interpreted, thus
    becoming as inscrutable as if the modelâs internals had been inaccessible in the
    first place. However, transparency, explainability, and interpretability are very
    important for any technical system with a moderate or large impact, be it in terms
    of dollars or human lives. Therefore, model explainability is very important in
    fields such as aerospace, medicine, insurance, banking, and more. Explainability
    is a hard problem because of several reasons. Firstly, it is user-dependent: the
    type of explanation expected by an average user will differ from that expected
    by a regulator or an engineer. This leads to the question âHow detailed must the
    explanation be, and what must it cover?â. Secondly, the expected outcome of transmitting
    an explanation can be hard to define, should the receiver become more able to
    predict model output after receiving explanations? Must the explanation point
    univocally to the features of the input data that had the largest impact on the
    produced results, and is this limited to input data, or does it also include training
    data? Perhaps it should illustrate a counterfactual - Â«What would need to change
    for the decision to have been different? Â» Or perhaps something else entirely?
    And are the previous goals mutually exclusive?â. There are a huge number of techniques
    to answer some of these and related questions. The field of Explainable AI (XAI)
    for short, is huge and expanding rapidly. Providing an overview of this field
    is not within the scope of the current publication, but we recommend our readers
    to consult the Interpretable Machine Learning book (Molnar, 2021) or one of the
    numerous reviews on the topic to learn more (Linardatos et al., 2021, Tjoa and
    Guan, 2020). 7.2.2. Robustness and reliability Reliability is the rate of failure
    of a system when operating in nominal conditions (e.g. 10-9 catastrophic failures
    per flight hour (âAC 25.1309-1A - System Design and Analysis â Document Information,â
    1988)). Since a rate of system error can be extremely challenging to calculate
    without operating the system, heuristic development rules like no single point
    of failure are accepted as valid ways to achieve the goal. This acceptance stems
    from either a competent authority, which implicitly accepts the risk of not properly
    achieving the desired reliability level or historical data when available. Neither
    is a possibility for current ML-based systems, due to an absence of historically
    validated, robust, and widely accepted heuristic design rules. For Machine Learning
    systems, reliability comes from two distinct factors: accuracy and robustness.
    An ML classifier with higher accuracy is less likely to misclassify an input,
    hence is more reliable. Performance does not usually come into play for classical
    software systemâs reliability as accuracy for a valid set of inputs and execution
    path is 100 %. This section does not concern itself with increasing model accuracy,
    a topic that is the main focus of each application-specific research field mentioned
    so far. Accuracy for an ML model is calculated over the data points in the test
    dataset and only those. While this is also true for classical software testing,
    in the latter the notion of input equivalence classes provides assurance that
    the software system will continue to perform acceptably for inputs outside the
    test set. Correctness equivalence classes for ML models do not currently exist.
    A similar notion of robustness can be used instead. A robust model has bounded
    accuracy loss for inputs that are within a bounded distance of the input distribution.
    This fact can be used to construct arguments for the reliability of an ML model.
    Equivalence class discovery for random forest models is a topic under active research
    (Cheng and Yan, 2021, TÃ¶rnblom and Nadjm-Tehrani, 2019). When demonstrating model
    robustness, several problems arise: Firstly, how does one quantify the distance
    between input data? Although several measures exist, they are often hard to relate
    to humans'' tacit notions of input distance. It is easier to qualitatively say
    to what degree an image does not depict a cat than it is to quantify it in a single
    measure. This only becomes harder for more abstract forms of input such as satellite
    telemetry data. Thus, relating system-level specifications to notions of input
    distance is sometimes complex. For a given distance definition, formal verification
    methods attempt to formally prove certain properties of DL models, including robustness
    (Katz et al., 2017, Mirman et al., 2018, MÃ¼ller et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2018).
    They allow a user to build a model tolerant to a certain distance between inputs.
    Equivalent research exists for other ML models, such as random forests (RFs) (TÃ¶rnblom
    and Nadjm-Tehrani, 2019), but the literature is significantly less developed.
    Note that these approaches allow a designer to fight adversarial examples, a specific
    and concerning failure mode for ML models (Chen et al., 2019, Goodfellow et al.,
    2015). Nonetheless, the literature on the generation and defeat of adversarial
    examples is highly active and ever-evolving, as measures, countermeasures, and
    counter-counter-measures get deployed. It is out of scope for this review to delve
    any deeper into that. Secondly, there is the well-known issue of generalization.
    A model may offer very good performance on a dataset and very poor performance
    on the actual population, in the phenomenon known as overfitting. The PAC-Bayes
    approach offers generalization bounds that specify a minimum number of samples
    from distribution for a desired performance and training process reliability levels
    within that distribution. These bounds, however, are often extremely conservative,
    and improving them is another active field of research (Shalev-Shwartz, 2014).
    Since it is hard to quantify these bounds appropriately, the only recourse for
    organizations to ensure performance is to collect massive amounts of data, which
    is prohibitively expensive or downright impossible in many cases. Since generalization
    and robustness shortcomings are highly model-specific, one approach to tackle
    them focuses on applying mixtures of models working in tandem, known as ensemble
    models, and selecting an output based on the collective response of the ensemble
    (Pang et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2021). Thirdly, and also related to the second
    issue, there is the phenomenon of domain drift (Shweta, 2019). Models do not just
    overfit to a given dataset but also to the current population. And, as time goes
    by, systems change. An FDIR system monitoring battery health will see its voltage
    decrease over time as the battery ages. The statistical distribution of deviations
    around the nominal value is also likely to change. The performance of the ML model
    will thus decrease over time as the world changes around it. Fine-tuning on new
    data can mitigate this issue but can trigger the phenomenon known as catastrophic
    forgetting (Nguyen et al., 2019), where the model loses performance on old and
    new data. A solution is to retrain it from scratch on new data, but this entails
    capturing that data and retraining the model, which increases operating costs
    and risks in hard to predict ways. Alternative solutions exist but they come with
    their own drawbacks. Training a model on a dataset representative of the whole
    systemâs life cycle can mitigate the issue but requires larger models and better
    data capture at the projectâs start. Lastly, models also overfit the specifics
    of the system theyâre trained for. A model trained for one specific satellite
    may have issues adapting to another satellite instance, or model. Version improvements
    such as equipment changes may bring performance hits with them too. While research
    fields like transfer learning, domain adaptation and domain generalization (Zhao
    et al., 2020) attempt to address the issue, they are far from universally reliable
    at the moment. This is particularly concerning for the space industry, where mass
    manufacturing and standardized equipment is the exception rather than the norm
    and can pose a serious challenge to the industryâs adoption of ML technologies.
    Sometimes, when adapting to new platforms, new input data will be available or
    new output data may be required. In this case, the field of transfer learning
    is applicable, which includes both domain adaptation and domain generalization.
    In short, despite the aforementioned techniques, ML models are extremely brittle
    to deviations in input data from the training dataset, and it can be assumed that
    deviations from the training dataset will break the system. Therefore, building
    proper datasets is a key task of any ML system designer or operator, a topic which
    we address in the next section. 7.2.3. Dataset construction Datasets are the lifeblood
    of ML. Therefore, it is only right to have standards assigned for data to avoid
    anomalies and have a perfect collection that will help produce the right results.
    Cappi et al. (Cappi et al., 2021) propose a Dataset Definition Standard (DDS),
    which, while not specifically geared toward space activities, can be applied to
    EO data from either payload or satellites. It aims to provide a standard for training,
    validating, or testing datasets. It explains in detail the recommendations to
    be followed while collecting data and how to annotate it and perform functions.
    The paper talks about many important aspects any dataset should possess, from
    how it must cover as many situations as possible that could be encountered during
    model development to how a history of every single change to every data must be
    kept helping with traceability and avoid discrepancy. The paper provides clear
    recommendations for labeling and annotation of data and how the dataset should
    be segregated for training, validation and testing. The US Geological Survey (Larry
    R et al., 2019) provides dataset standards for their various operations like Biological,
    Climate and Forecast and Mapping. Cleansing âdirty dataâ is mentioned as a common
    problem faced by data scientists. They also take it a step further with geological
    mapping by producing a set of parameter standards to be followed while collecting
    data which define a set of rules for individual parameters within the dataset.
    The parameter standards cover a wide range of qualities like the date/time, geographic
    coordinates, codes, etc. the satellite data should contain. Report (Larry R et
    al., 2019) explains how exactly a topographical map of anything in the US should
    be produced and one important aspect of it is the data standards including which
    standards the file formats of the data should be stored in. For the data quality
    standards, they delve into it by discussing various components like currency,
    consistency, completeness, and accuracy. The paper covers every aspect of mapping
    data from dealing with off grid and oversized maps, data sources and resolutions
    to how cartographic features should be interpreted. The primary space operation
    in Earth Orbit is remote sensing. As a result, they are the primary data-producing
    activities. Therefore, remote sensing standards are relatively well developed
    when compared to other ML operations in the space industry. Authors (Di, 2008,
    Di and Kobler, 2000) go in-depth about all standards of remote sensing including
    the dataset standards. Di and Kobler (Liping Di and Ben Kobler, 2000) introduce
    NASAâs well developed EO Systemsâ Data Information Systems (EOSDIS). As the EOSDIS
    will process data from various fields it is not feasible for the system to deal
    with every single data collected one by one. This has led to EOSDIS establishing
    standards to deal specifically with remote sensing data. 7.3. Recommendations
    As outlined above, ML systems face a number of issues precluding their application
    in many scenarios where they would otherwise be useful. We believe the fundamental
    research being carried out on ML model robustness is of great interest and recommend
    that any practitioner follow it closely. For certain small-scale problems, work
    on formal verification of ML models may already be enough to ascertain that the
    network responds appropriately within the input regime, and input data outside
    of this regime can be purged by data verification systems implemented in classical
    software. Further, we recommend that any practitioner keep a careful watch for
    ways in which the lifecycle operation of a system will deviate from the training
    scenarios, and mitigate the risks issued from model brittleness to these differences.
    The system must undergo a verification process to be verified and validated. The
    critical levels of various ML models are displayed in Table 2. Table 2. ML Certification
    Criticality levels (Winter et al., 2021). Criticality Level (CL) Impact Potential
    (Examples) ML Application Requirements 1 There is no risk of harm to living beings,
    no risk of loss of confidential data, and no ethical or privacy concerns. Basic
    minimum requirements of a competently developed ML application are fulfilled.
    2 Living beings could be harmed with limited, no permanent damage. Temporarily
    unavailability of non-critical data and services, violation of ethical concerns
    without identifiable harm to actual persons. The ML application is developed according
    to industry standards and follows best practices that are regarded as state of
    the art. 3 Living beings could die or be restricted for life; the environment
    could be damaged. Manipulation of data with severe financial consequences and
    loss of control of the system to malicious attackers. The ML application is developed
    and documented with great care. Safety & Security is ensured with processes and
    techniques that go beyond traditional best practices and industry standards. 4
    Many living beings could die or could be restricted for life; the environment
    could be damaged permanently. Loss of information which endangers the existence
    of the organization. Long-term unavailability of critical data or services without
    which the organization cannot function. The ML application is developed and documented
    with great care. Safety & Security is ensured with processes and techniques that
    go beyond traditional best practices and industry standards. All components of
    the ML application are formally secured and validated. Major certification topics
    must be re-examined, even though known certification procedures for traditional
    applications cannot be used in a clear manner in the context of ML. This technology''s
    total effectiveness and safety would be enhanced with a comprehensive certification
    strategy for machine learning applications, which would boost public acceptance
    and trust. Winter et al (Winter et al., 2021) proposal for certification criteria
    for supervised learning with low-risk potential is shown in Fig. 6. Download :
    Download high-res image (128KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. ML
    Certification workflow (Winter et al., 2021). ML explainability is another core
    issue; explainability of model decisions can and does take precedence over model
    performance in scenarios with high-impact decisions or where (human) learning
    from the modelâs decisions is key. Current model explainability methods can offer
    insight into the relevant features of input data used for a modelâs decision,
    but they can also provide misleading or unhelpful signals. For applications where
    explainability is an important feature of the system, dictionary, tree, or kernel-based
    models and other easily explainable methods should be compared with harder-to-explain
    models for a performance-explainability trade-off. National recommendations, white
    papers and initial official standards in the AI and ML field attest to the growing
    interest in the subject. While the scope of these is much broader than the space
    sector alone, some considerations can be applied to ML for space applications
    too. Data quality and availability will play an important role in the adoption
    of ML across EO Operations and will certainly be demanded by supervisory and regulatory
    agencies performing standardization and certification. This need goes beyond the
    mere abundance of data. Relevance, cleanliness, and useability will require careful
    attention and control. The industry can leverage work from other fields such as
    the aforementioned dataset standards to achieve this. Publicly available datasets
    can also be a boon to adoption, such as those listed in (Cole, 2022, Rieke, 2022).
    8. Discussion & conclusion In the area of ML in EO Operations, this evaluation
    effort covers different aspects, including ground operations, enhanced GNC, on-board
    image processing, FDIR, and standardization. It examined the state of the field,
    which serves as a baseline, and brought to light intriguing trends. We have discovered
    that there is mounting evidence in numerous application sectors that EO missions
    can benefit from ML usage on-board. Case studies uncovered have demonstrated advancements
    in platform autonomy and performance. New capabilities, such as automated payload
    data filtering by sending only pertinent photos to the ground, can lower downlink
    bandwidth requirements, which is crucial for smaller satellites but also lessens
    radio frequency band saturation. Better visual-based processing also makes it
    possible for spacecraft to navigate using their visual systems, and RL shows promise
    in developing more effective nonlinear controllers. Better autonomous decision-making
    for EO missions is made possible by autonomous FDIR operations, allowing current
    teams to manage more operations more efficiently and lowering satellite operating
    costs. On-board processors must meet high criteria imposed by ML algorithms. A
    significant difficulty is the need to optimize ML models for space applications
    at the hardware and software levels. The good news for space platform operators
    is that this reflects and exemplifies the considerably more difficult task of
    installing ML on edge platforms. The community can benefit from a sizable and
    growing body of knowledge and expertise. From the perspective of on-board EO applications,
    ML has mostly been used for cloud detection and novelty/change detection. These
    applications frequently use vision-based techniques. EO applications could learn
    technical knowledge from other technical disciplines that have extensively researched
    vision-based ML methods and solutions. There are a few examples of SAR-based images
    as well, though. This would imply that there is still an opportunity for advancement
    and growth of these sensors in all-weather, all-day usage. A parallel but closely
    related track to research and applications is being standardized. There are currently
    no established standards for ML in the space industry. Key areas, including explainability,
    robustness, and data structure creation, are the subject of rigorous research.
    EO Operators creating ML applications ought to make use of this area for improved
    performance and dependability. These research areas should be taken into account
    by organizations intending to publish standards and guidelines, but they must
    be avoided at all costs to prevent over-prescription of remedies that might compromise
    the success of standardization development. Another important element that unites
    all ML-based EO Operations is the availability of data. The ability to use more
    data for machine learning in EO operations might significantly advance technology
    and benefit all participants, including business, academia, and space agencies.
    There are not many open datasets available right now, and those are mostly designed
    for image processing or visual navigation applications. The technological improvement
    favored by open datasets in a wider range of applications is a significant long-term
    goal for the space sector, even while it may be counter to a particular organization''s
    short-term goals to disclose private data. We think the field should concentrate
    on producing and disseminating such open datasets, and we encourage players without
    a profit motive like space agencies, to take the lead in attaining this goal.
    The fact that currently, few EO missions have used ML in orbit is a common finding
    across the subtopics of this review. This can be ascribed to the space industry''s
    lengthy lead periods and slow cycles, which contrast with other sectors, such
    the automotive industry, which have embraced the technology. We anticipate that
    these cycles can be sped up as technology demonstrators move quickly from test
    benches to orbit with the advent of New Space and faster access to space. Further
    enhancing the efficiency of ML deployments in the EO Operations industry and the
    space industry at large, increasing the number of missions can result in better
    data collecting and platform standardization. Based on the preceding critical
    review, it is quite evident that incorporating ML into EO operation can maximize
    its potential and promote additional study. The following key topics will be the
    focus of EO research in light of current trends and requirements: 1. Investigating
    the Machine Learning-based Mission Planning and Scheduling (MPS), 2. Examine the
    potential for Machine Learning techniques to improve Guidance, Navigation and
    Control (GNC) in space operations, 3. Examine the potential of ML techniques to
    assist with on-board data processing (OBDP), 4. Explore the effectiveness of incorporating
    ML models into resource-constrained platforms, 5. Investigate the effectiveness
    of Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) using Machine Learning techniques.
    Not to mention, we have found that the use of ML for EO operations frequently
    lags behind the state-of-the-art. Transformer models on sequential and other data
    are one example of a technique that has achieved significant success in research
    and operational environments but has not yet been publicly used for EO Operations
    issues. Similar to formal verification and other verified robustness techniques,
    there are very few applications for resource reduction strategies like pruning,
    distillation, or quantization. Researchers and operators can use this critical
    assessment as a resource for further ML deployment and experimentation in demanding,
    complicated future EO missions that are more autonomous, communicate only useful
    data, and require much less involvement. Declaration of Competing Interest The

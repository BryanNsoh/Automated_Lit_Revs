    • A method for modelling field-scale fluxes with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 is
    tested. • It combines machine-learning sharpener and physically-based disaggregation
    approach. • Resulting fluxes have relative error less than 20% in agricultural
    setting. • Resulting fluxes show correct spatial and temporal patterns at field
    scale. • Comparison with flux towers indicate better accuracy than low resolution
    fluxes. Abstract The Sentinel satellite missions are designed to provide remote-sensing
    observational capability to many diverse operational applications, including in
    the field of agriculture and food security. They do this by acquiring frequent
    observations from a combination of optical, thermal and microwave sensors at various
    spatial resolutions. However, one currently missing capability, that would enable
    monitoring of evapotranspiration, crop water stress and water use at field scale,
    is the lack of high-resolution (tens of meters) thermal sensor. In this study
    we evaluate a methodology for bridging this data gap by employing a machine learning
    algorithm to sharpen low-resolution thermal observations from the Sentinel-3 satellites
    using images acquired by high-resolution optical sensors on the Sentinel-2 satellites.
    The resulting dataset is then used as input to land-surface energy balance model
    to estimate evapotranspiration. The methodology is tested using Terra and Landsat
    satellite observations, due to lack of sufficiently long time-series of Sentinel
    observations, and benchmarked against fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal
    observations acquired by the Landsat satellites. We then apply the methodology
    to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to confirm its applicability to this type
    of data. The results show that the fluxes derived with sharpened thermal data
    are of acceptable accuracy (relative error lower than 20%) and provide more information
    at flux-tower footprint scale than the corresponding low-resolution fluxes. They
    also replicate the spatial and temporal patterns of fluxes derived with high-resolution
    thermal observations. However, the increase in error of the modelled fluxes compared
    to using high-resolution thermal observations and the inherent limitations of
    the sharpening approach point to the need to add high-resolution thermal mission
    to the Sentinels'' constellation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    flux 1. Introduction The Sentinel satellite missions are opening an operational
    era for the use of remote sensing observations in many domains, due to their range
    of spatial and spectral resolutions, frequent revisit times and long term guarantee
    of data continuity (Donlon et al., 2012, Drusch et al., 2012, Torres et al., 2012).
    Among those domains are agriculture and food security, for which Sentinel data
    has been used to operationally create dynamic cropland masks (Valero et al., 2016),
    perform crop type mapping (Inglada et al., 2015), monitor rice production (Torbick
    et al., 2017) or estimate plant parameters such as leaf area index (Campos-Taberner
    et al., 2017, Clevers et al., 2017), all at field-scale spatial resolution ( 10–20 m).
    Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from satellite based observations
    are also of high interest in agriculture and food security domains as well as
    in other applications such as water resource management (Anderson et al., 2012).
    To be of most use, the ET maps should have a spatial resolution on the order of
    spatial scale of the predominant landscape feature (Guzinski et al., 2014, Kustas
    et al., 2004), which in terms of agriculture is a field that often ranges from
    hundreds (10 m by 10 m) to thousands (100 m by 100 m) of meters square (Lowder
    et al., 2016). At the same time, to reliably estimate the actual ET and crop water
    stress it is preferable to utilise satellite observations both in visible/near-infrared
    (VISNIR) and thermal-infrared (TIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (Anderson
    et al., 2012, Hoffmann et al., 2016a). However, the Sentinel satellite constellation
    contains only one TIR sensor (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer - SLSTR)
    with a spatial resolution of 1000 m at nadir (on board of the Sentinel-3 satellite),
    while having multiple sensors with VISNIR observations capability ranging from
    a spatial resolution of 10 m to 1000 m (on board of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3
    satellites). Even though recent studies have been highlighting the importance
    of high-resolution TIR observations for ET estimation (Fisher et al., 2017, Sobrino
    et al., 2016a) and a number of satellite mission concepts are (or have been) proposed
    (Crebassol et al., 2014, Jul, Lagouarde et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2015) or even
    launched (Hulley et al., 2017), a high-resolution TIR satellite mission which
    could act as a companion to the high-resolution VISNIR Sentinel-2 satellites is
    not expected to be launched within the closest number of years. Therefore, a method
    is required to bridge the spatial gap between the currently available Sentinel
    constellation''s TIR and VISNIR observational capabilities in order to optimally
    exploit the synergies of both types of sensors for field-scale ET estimations.
    A number of techniques have been developed for sharpening lower spatial resolution
    TIR observations with higher spatial resolution VISNIR observations (Chen et al.,
    2014, Bindhu et al., 2013, Bisquert et al., 2016, Gao et al., 2012). Most of those
    techniques consist of two general steps. In the first step, a relationship is
    derived between the TIR data and high-resolution VISNIR data aggregated to the
    resolution of the TIR data. In the second step, this relationship is applied to
    high-resolution VISNIR data to obtain TIR observations at the same high resolution.
    A post-processing step is sometimes also included which, for example, removes
    the bias between TIR datasets at the two resolutions. This sharpened TIR data
    can then be used in land-surface energy flux models to estimate high-resolution
    ET. Similarly, a number of techniques have been developed for disaggregating low-resolution
    land surface energy fluxes to higher spatial resolutions (Guzinski et al., 2014,
    Norman et al., 2003). Those techniques rely on the higher spatial resolution TIR
    data (for example coming from the Landsat series of satellites), which are assumed
    to have lower accuracy than the coarser resolution TIR data. Furthermore, it should
    be also possible to sharpen the estimated low-resolution land surface fluxes using
    purely high-resolution VISNIR data following the same approach as for sharpening
    low-resolution TIR data. Both of those approaches (i.e. sharpening low-resolution
    TIR data using high-resolution VISNIR data and using the sharpened output to estimate
    high-resolution ET; and directly sharpening estimated ET using high-resolution
    VISNIR data) are applicable to the Sentinel-2 (S2) –Sentinel-3(S3) satellite constellation.
    In this study we evaluate a number of combinations of the sharpening and disaggregation
    approaches for their ability to produce high-resolution ET maps in a river catchment
    in western Denmark. The evaluation includes the validation of the fluxes against
    two flux towers located in the catchment (one in an agricultural site and the
    other in a coniferous plantation forest) as well as comparison of spatial and
    temporal patterns of high-resolution ET produced by the different techniques.
    Due to the lack of sufficient number of Sentinel-3 images, we use Terra and Aqua
    (MODIS sensor) satellite data as a proxy for Sentinel-3 and Landsat data as a
    proxy for Sentinel-2. Even though the spectral bands of the sensors on board those
    pairs satellite are not exactly the same, the spatial resolutions are similar
    (≈1000 m for Terra/Aqua and S3 TIR data, and 30 m for Landsat VISNIR data compared
    to 10–20 m for S2 VISNIR data) and thus the study provides guidance on the optimal
    approach for deriving high-resolution ET with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 observations.
    2. Methods 2.1. Data sharpening scheme The data sharpening method used in this
    study is based on Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) introduced by Gao et al. (2012).
    In the current study it was implemented as an open-source Python application,
    which is freely available online (https://github.com/radosuav/pyDMS, last accessed:
    01/06-2017). The DMS is a machine-learning algorithm that derives a statistical
    relationship between the predictor high-resolution variables aggregated to low-resolution
    data pixels and the low-resolution variables that need to be sharpened. It then
    applies this relationship to the high-resolution data to derive high-resolution
    representation of the low-resolution data. The current DMS implementation is based
    on an ensemble of decision-tree regressors, with each decision-tree trained with
    a random subset of the training samples drawn with replacement in a method known
    as Bagging (Breiman, 1996). The final value of the regression is an average of
    the values produced within the ensemble. The training sample is composed of the
    fine resolution data which passes a homogeneity threshold when aggregated to the
    coarser resolution (i.e. the coefficient of variation of high-resolution pixels
    falling within a low-resolution pixel must be below a certain threshold). All
    samples falling within a single regression tree leaf node are further fitted with
    a multivariate linear model. Therefore, once the DMS is trained an output value
    for a given input is determined by locating a regression tree leaf to which the
    input belongs and running the corresponding linear model, for an ensemble of regression
    trees. The ensemble decision tree regression is performed both locally (in a moving-window
    fashion) and globally (i.e. to the whole study area shown in Fig. 1). The results
    are then combined based on residuals between the regression outputs and the low-resolution
    training data (Gao et al., 2012). Also residual analysis and bias correction between
    regression outputs and low-resolution data is applied at the end of the sharpening
    process to ensure consistency (i.e. conservation of emitted longwave energy in
    case of thermal data) between the sharpened high-resolution pixels and their corresponding
    low-resolution pixel. Download : Download high-res image (728KB) Download : Download

    Landsat scene used in DMS. 2.2. Land surface fluxes'' modelling scheme The land
    surface fluxes'' modelling scheme is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB)
    modelling scheme proposed by Norman et al. (1995) and further evolved in Kustas
    and Norman (1999). Briefly, the model splits the directional radiometric land
    surface temperature into its two main components: the temperatures of vegetation
    and soil. Based on this, net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of
    vegetation and soil are estimated separately, before being combined to obtain
    the bulk surface fluxes. The transfer of heat between the two components and the
    atmosphere is modulated by “resistances” (in analogy to electrical systems) which
    depend on aerodynamic and meteorological conditions. Those resistances can be
    in parallel or series configuration, and in this study the latter one was used
    since it better accounts for the interaction between turbulent fluxes originating
    from the two components (Li et al., 2005, Morillas et al., 2013). In addition,
    the ground heat flux of the soil is estimated following the method of Santanello
    and Friedl (2003). At both the component and bulk levels the model enforces the
    principle of conservation of energy. For more implementation details the reader
    is referred to the full source code of the Python implementation of the model
    used in this study which available online (https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB/releases/tag/v1.4,
    last accessed 21.10.2018) and the referenced publications. 2.3. Flux disaggregation
    scheme The flux disaggregation scheme is described in Guzinski et al. (2014) and
    is based on the assumption of evaporative fraction (EF - fraction of total available
    energy used for latent heat flux) remaining stable during the late-morning and
    early-afternoon hours under cloud-free conditions. The EF is estimated independently
    from TSEB fluxes derived using the low-resolution and high-resolution data. The
    high-resolution EF is then aggregated to the lower resolution and compared against
    the low-resolution EF. If the fine-resolution EF is higher (lower) than coarse-resolution
    EF in a given coarse-resolution pixel then the air temperature at blending height
    of that pixel is decreased (increased), in order to decrease (increase) the latent
    heat flux and the fine-resolution fluxes are recalculated. This is done under
    the assumption that the coarse-resolution temperature data produces more accurate
    flux estimates and therefore the high-resolution fluxes have to be adjusted to
    match the low-resolution ones (a valid expectation in case of Landsat and MODIS
    thermal sensors as well as in the case of sharpened thermal images). 2.4. Evaluated
    model configurations In this study we compare the high-resolution ( 30 m) flux
    estimates derived in three different ways: using Landsat LST in TSEB together
    with the disaggregation scheme and low-resolution fluxes derived with MODIS LST
    (disTSEBL); using DMS sharpened MODIS LST directly in TSEB (TSEBM,DMS); and finally
    using DMS sharpened MODIS LST in TSEB together with the disaggregation scheme
    (disTSEBM,DMS). The first model configuration is used as benchmarks for the latter
    two. In addition TSEB was also run with low-resolution MODIS data (TSEBM) to allow
    evaluation of the benefit (or lack thereof) of deriving the fluxes at higher resolution.
    All those model runs were repeated twice: once with tower-based meteorological
    inputs (optimal case) and once with modelled meteorological inputs (typical case
    for regional applications). The two meteorological datasets are described in Section
    3. Finally, the application of DMS to low-resolution fluxes (instead of low-resolution
    LST) was also tested (TSEB-DMSM) but only when modelled meteorological data was
    used, since regional scale flux estimates are needed for training the DMS. 3.
    Data 3.1. Study sites and tower-based measurements The study area is located in
    the Skjern river catchment on the western side of Denmark''s Jutland peninsula
    (Fig. 1). It is a heavily agricultural area consisting mostly of fields of winter
    and summer barley, potatoes and plantation forest. Even though it experiences
    a mild maritime climate with an average temperature of 8 °C and average annual
    rainfall of 850 mm, irrigation of the crops is still required due to the predominantly
    sandy nature of the soil (Ringgaard et al., 2011). The Skjern catchment is the
    location of the Danish Hydrological ObsErvatory (HOBE) which maintains three eddy-covariance
    (EC) flux towers within the area (Jensen and Illangasekare, 2011). The measurements
    from two of those towers, one located in a barley field near the town of Voulund
    (referred to as VOU tower) and the other in a conifer plantation forest with an
    average tree height of 20 m close to the town of Gludsted (referred to as GLU
    tower), are used in the current study. The area around the VOU tower is heterogeneous
    at 1 km scale, with multiple fields as well as shrubs and forests falling within
    a 1 km radius. The GLU tower, on the other hand, is surrounded by the plantation
    forest for at least 1 km in each direction but becomes heterogeneous upon closer
    inspection with different tree stands, clearings and forest roads visible at higher
    resolutions. The VOU tower has the EC system located at 6 m height above ground
    level (agl) and an air temperature and humidity sensor located at a height of
    4 m agl. At the GLU tower the EC system is at a height of 38 m agl and air temperature
    and humidity were measured at a height of 30 m agl. Both towers also have sensors
    for measuring four components of net radiation (incoming/outgoing and shortwave/longwave)
    as well as heat plates in the vicinity of the towers for the measurement of ground
    heat flux. More detailed description of the towers'' location and set-up can be
    found in Ringgaard et al. (2011), while the pre-processing applied to tower measurements
    is described in Guzinski et al. (2014). Meteorological measurements from the flux
    towers (air temperature and humidity, wind speed, and incoming solar radiation)
    were used as inputs to the TSEB model for the local-scale model runs. The fluxes
    measured by the towers (sensible heat, latent heat, ground heat and net radiation)
    were used to validate the TSEB model outputs. The energy balance closure at both
    towers was enforced by assigning the residual energy to the latent heat flux,
    as was done in previous studies utilising the same data (Guzinski et al., 2013,
    Guzinski et al., 2014, Hoffmann et al., 2016b). Flux tower footprint were estimated
    as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). 3.2. Satellite data The low-resolution
    (≈1000 m) data originates from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra and Aqua satellites.
    Four products from Collection 6 were used: MOD11A1 - instantaneous land surface
    temperature and emissivity (LST), at daily timestep (Wan, 2014); MCD15AH2 - 8 day
    leaf area index (LAI) composite (Yan et al., 2016); MCD43A3 - 16 day albedo composite;
    MOD13A2 - 16 day vegetation indices composite. The products that are provided
    with 500 m resolution (MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3) were resampled to 1000 m using pixel
    averaging. The albedo used in the models was derived from MCD43A3 white and black
    sky albedos with an assumption that in clear-sky atmosphere 80% of the light is
    direct and 20% diffuse. This was then further split into canopy and soil components
    using fraction of vegetation cover (see below) and the assumption that in the
    visible part of the spectrum albedo of soil is twice that of vegetation and in
    the near-infrared albedo of soil is 70% of that of vegetation. This assumption
    is based on standard spectral profiles of soil and vegetation (Baldridge et al.,
    2009) and while it might have an effect on the component fluxes originating from
    soil and vegetation, its impact on the bulk fluxes should be minimal, especially
    for moderate to dense canopies (e.g. LAI > 1). Emissivity was similarly split
    into soil and vegetation components by assigning vegetation the value of 0.995
    and estimating the soil emissivity using fraction of vegetation cover and emissivity
    from MOD11A1 product. While MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3 products are derived from observations
    taken by both Terra and Aqua satellites, it was decided to use only Terra observations
    for the instantaneous land surface temperature model inputs since the overpass
    time of Terra is closer to that of Sentinel-3. The high-resolution (30 m) data
    came from the sensors on board Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites.
    The atmospheric correction of both thermal and shortwave images was performed
    as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). Vegetation indices were calculated directly
    from the top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectances while Landsat LST was derived as described
    in Guzinski et al. (2014). It should be noted that while thermal data is acquired
    by the Landsat satellites at a resolution ranging from 60 m to 120 m (depending
    on the satellite), it is resampled to 30 m using cubic convolution before distribution
    to the users and therefore in this study was assumed to have a resolution of 30 m.
    High resolution LAI and albedo were derived by running the DMS (see Section 2.1)
    with TOC VISNIR Landsat reflectances and MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3 MODIS products respectively.
    The DMS and TOC VISNIR Landsat reflectances were also used to sharpen the MOD11A1
    MODIS LST products to be used as a replacement of Landsat LST, as well as to sharpen
    flux outputs of the low-resolution TSEB model runs. In all cases the moving-window
    size for local regression was set to 30 by 30 MODIS pixels and the homogeneity
    threshold for both local and global regressions was set automatically to select
    the 80% most homogeneous pixels from the aggregated fine-resolution image. The
    linear regression extrapolation was limited to 25% of the range of the training
    samples falling within the corresponding regression tree leaf node (see Section
    2.1). The DMS was applied on a scene-by-scene basis, meaning that the Landsat
    scenes were not combined into a larger multi-temporal training data set but each
    Landsat scene was used individually to sharpen MODIS product or TSEB output corresponding
    to the scene acquisition date. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were used to derive fraction of vegetation
    that is green and actively transpiring (fg). In most land cover classes (see Section
    3.3 below) fg was estimated as following the approach of Guzinski et al. (2013).
    The only exception was in croplands where fg = EV I during crop senescence (set
    as between day-of-year 160 and 230) and fg = 1 during other periods, in order
    to avoid issues present in this land cover class detailed in Guzinski et al. (2013).
    MODIS LAI (both original resolution and sharpened) was assumed to represent green
    LAI and hence was divided by fg to obtain Plant Area Index (PAI) which was then
    used as input into for modelling intercepted radiation and wind attenuation processes.
    NDVI was also used to estimate fractional vegetation cover (fC) as where NDVIS
    is the vegetation of bare soil and assigned a value of 0.15 and NDVIV is NDVI
    of full vegetation cover and assigned a value of 0.9 (Gutman and Ignatov, 1998).
    3.3. Ancillary data Apart from the data coming from satellite observations, the
    TSEB model requires two other spatially distributed datasets. The first one is
    a land-cover map which, together with a look-up table, is used to assign input
    surface parameters that cannot be directly retrieved from satellite observations,
    e.g. vegetation height or average leaf size. In this study the land-cover map
    was based on Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 version 18.5, downloaded from the Copernicus
    Land Monitoring Service (http://land.copernicus.eu, last accessed 21.08.2017).
    The map was reclassified from Corine classes to those shown in Fig. 1 and resampled
    from the original 100 m resolution to either 30 m resolution (using nearest neighbour
    approach) for the high-resolution model runs or to 930 m resolution (using mode
    approach) for the low-resolution runs. Afterwards both maps were used to assign
    input parameters based on Table 1. Vegetation height (hC) has the largest influence
    on the modelled fluxes from all the parameters listed in Table 1. Therefore in
    land cover classes where it changes throughout the growing season (grasslands
    and croplands) it was scaled with PAI using power law, with maximum value indicated
    in Table 1 reached when PAI was 5 in croplands and 4 in grasslands and a minimum
    value set to 10% of the maximum value. Table 1. TSEB model parameters assigned

    0.40 0.40 0.40 The second ancillary dataset (required for regional-scale runs)
    is the input meteorological data, which in this study are obtained from the ERA-Interim
    reanalysis data set (Dee et al., 2011) produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range
    Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Three ERA-Interim products were used: the 2 m air temperature
    (2T), 2 m dew point temperature (2D) used to calculate the vapour pressure, and
    the 10 m horizontal wind speed (10U and 10V). Although the 2T product nominally
    represents the air temperature at 2 m height, in this study it was assumed to
    represent regional-scale blending-height air temperature (due to low spatial resolution
    and smoothness of the product) and therefore was placed at 100 m agl. To compensate
    for the height difference the 2T air temperature was reduced by 1 K, in accordance
    with dry adiabatic lapse rate, before being used as input to the models. The wind
    field was assumed to be at 10 m above the canopy. The meteorological data are
    provided at a 0.75° spatial resolution and were subset and resampled for the high
    and low-resolution model runs. In the temporal domain the data were linearly interpolated
    between the 3-hourly ERA-Interim time steps. The only meteorological dataset which
    came from field-based observations instead of the reanalysis dataset was the incoming
    shortwave radiation, based on the assumption that clear-sky shortwave radiation
    is uniform at regional scale and on the findings of Guzinski et al. (2014). 4.
    Results In this section we validate the high-resolution modelled fluxes against
    flux tower measurements at the VOU and GLU sties. In addition we evaluate the
    differences between the fluxes modelled with Landsat LST and sharpened LST in
    the spatial and temporal domains. This analysis focuses on the agricultural site
    since this is where high-resolution observations provide the most utility. Finally,
    we apply the proposed methodology to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data and compare
    with fluxes obtained using Landsat-8 LST at regional scale. 4.1. Voulund agricultural
    area Table 2 summarizes the performance of the TSEB algorithm when run at Landsat
    resolution using tower-based meteorological inputs, with the scatterplot of modelled
    versus measured fluxes shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, Table 3 and in Fig. 3 show
    the results when tower-based meteorological measurements are replaced by ERA-Interim
    fields. Concurrent cloud-free observations by Landsat and Terra satellites over
    the VOU site were present on 19 dates during the study period. However, due to
    issues with tower-based flux measurements, the modelled H, LE, Rn and G could
    be compared to measurements on 19, 15, 16 and 18 dates respectively. Table 2.

    The results at the agricultural site indicate that although the fluxes derived
    with sharpened MODIS LST do not provide the same accuracy as fluxes derived with
    Landsat LST (especially in case of sensible heat flux), they still provide an
    improvement compared to MODIS coarse scale fluxes, in particular if the disaggregation
    approach is being used. The RMSE of H decreases by 12 to 14 W/m2(around 20%) and
    correlation increases by 0.03 to 0.05 between the TSEBM and disTSEBM,DMS runs,
    depending on which meteorological inputs were used. A smaller decrease in RMSE
    (6 to 9 /m2) and larger increase in correlation (0.13) is also present between
    those two runs in case of LE. This implies that by sharpening the coarse LST with
    finer resolution optical data it is possible, to a certain degree, to separate
    the fluxes originating from within the flux tower footprint from the fluxes falling
    outside of it. Sharpened coarse-resolution modelled fluxes (configuration TSEB-DMSM)
    are also closer to the tower measurements compared to the original resolution
    coarse fluxes but the improvements are not as large as when sharpened model inputs
    are used. The ground heat flux modelled at high spatial resolution has lower correlation
    compared to the low resolution G, regardless of the model configuration used.
    This might indicate inaccurate estimation of net radiation of the soil at higher
    spatial resolution but due to the small magnitude of G it should not significantly
    impact the other fluxes. It is also worth noting that at the VOU site there is
    an increase in modelled H error when switching from Landsat LST to sharpened LST,
    while there is a slight decrease in error when switching from tower-based meteorological
    inputs to ERA-Interim dataset. For example, the decrease in RMSE of H for the
    disTSEBM,DMS runs driven by the two types of meteorological inputs is 3 W/m2(correlation
    decreases from 0.76 to 0.73) while the increase in RMSE between disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS
    is 15 to 18 W/m2(correlation decreases by 0.16). In case of latent heat flux the
    situation is somewhat different, with RMSE increasing by 16 W/m2 and correlation
    decreasing by 0.14 when tower-based data is replaced by ERA-Interim for the disTSEBL
    run, while the RMSE of LE increases by 2 W/m2 between the disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS
    runs when using tower-based dataset and decreases by 3 W/m2 when using ERA-Interim
    datasets. 4.2. Gludset plantation forest The statistical evaluation of modelled
    fluxes at the GLU site is shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4 for runs in which tower-based

    2.4. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the web version of this article.) At the GLU site there
    is a strong and consistent underestimation of Rn (bias ranging from −24 W/m2 to
    −51 W/m2) despite very strong correlation (r always above 0.97) for all model
    runs. Based on this high correlation, the underestimation can probably be attributed
    to consistent overestimation in the parameterization of reflectance (albedo) and/or
    transmittance of the short-wave radiation by canopy or soil. This bias seems to
    mostly transfer to the estimates of H in case of tower-based meteorological inputs
    and estimates of LE in case of ERA-Interim inputs. In addition the estimation
    of G has very low correlation, but due to low G values under the forest canopy
    that should not have a significant impact on the accuracy of other modelled fluxes.
    At the forest site, the RMSE of H and LE from the TSEBM run is lower than that
    of disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS runs with both types of meteorological inputs, with
    the exception of high-resolution H estimated with ERA-Interim dataset which has
    lower error than the low-resolution H. This could be because the forest site is
    homogeneous at low spatial resolution while becoming heterogeneous at higher resolutions,
    which is directly opposite of the agricultural site. In addition, forest canopy
    is more complex than that of crops, with possibility of within-canopy heat storage
    or different wind attenuation compared to a vertically homogeneous canopy (Massman
    et al., 2017). Those factors could be more influential when modelled at higher
    spatial resolutions. This, together with large shifts in bias between H and LE
    when using the two types of meteorological inputs, make it hard to come to any
    firm conclusions with respect to the applicability of the sharpened LST in forested
    land covers. However, similarly to the situation at VOU, disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS
    provide the most accurate high-resolution flux estimates. 4.3. Spatial pattern
    comparison In the above sections the fluxes modelled by different configurations
    of model inputs and approaches were evaluated against measurements from two flux
    towers. Even though tower footprints were taken into account, those evaluations
    can be essentially considered to be performed at a single point. However, it is
    also important to evaluate how similar or different are the fluxes produced by
    the different model runs in a spatial context. In particular, we focus on fluxes
    produced by the disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS model runs driven by tower-based meteorological
    observations (see Table 2 and Fig. 2) in the area surrounding the VOU flux tower.
    Since disTSEBL uses LST derived from actual thermal observation it is considered
    as the reference dataset. disTSEBL models fluxes at the time of Landsat overpass
    while disTSEBM,DMS at the time of MODIS overpass and therefore a direct comparison
    of the fluxes is not possible. Instead evaporative fraction is used, under the
    assumption that it remains constant during the morning hours in cloud free conditions.
    Fig. 6 shows a visual comparison of EF on three selected dates, while Fig. 7 shows
    the scatterplot of disTSEBL versus disTSEBM,DMS EF on the same dates but only
    from pixels which were classified as belonging to cropland land cover class. The
    three dates were chosen such that on the first date (beginning of the growing
    season) the EF at VOU is high, in the second it is intermediate and in the third
    it is low (end of the growing season). Fig. 6 shows that in general the EF modelled
    with sharpened LST is able to capture the spatial patterns of the reference dataset,
    although with somewhat reduced range. This reduced range is evident at the beginning
    of the season (Figs. 6 top row and 7a) when the contrast of reflectance between
    the different fields is quite low due to limited amount of green crops present
    on the fields. In that case the higher values of LST (lower EF) are not well captured
    by the LST sharpening process. Similarly, in the middle of the season (Figs. 6
    middle row and 7b), the contrast of reflectance between the different fields is
    also low (due to most fields being covered with green crops) and high EF values
    are not well represented. On the other hand, when the contrast in the reflectance
    between the fields is high (Figs. 6 bottom row and 7c) the variability of EF is
    very well captured by the sharpened LST. Therefore, one possible limitation of
    the sharpening method is that it might require contrasting surfaces at different
    vegetation densities. Download : Download high-res image (870KB) Download : Download

    with disaggregation (x-axis, disTSEBL) was plotted against EF modelled using sharpened
    MODIS LST and TSEB with disaggregation (y-axis, disTSEBM,DMS). The plot includes
    all pixels from the area shown in Fig. 6 which fall into cropland landcover class.
    Another contributing factor could be that the first two scenes were acquired by
    Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on Landsat 5, while the last scene was acquired by
    Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7. This has two consequences:
    firstly ETM+ has increased radiometric sensitivity, accuracy and dynamic range
    over TM (Barsi et al., 2007); and secondly due to orbit of Landsat 5 only two
    thirds of the catchment area shown in Fig. 1 are captured during an overpass which
    leads to less training points for the DMS. Both of those issues should be resolved
    when using Sentinel-2 optical observations to sharpen Sentinel-3 TIR data, hopefully
    leading to wider range of modelled ET: firstly Sentinel-2 optical sensor has 12
    bit radiometric resolution (compared to 8 bit resolution for Landsat 5 and Landsat
    7) and low radiometric noise; and secondly Sentinel-2 has wider swath width than
    Landsat satellites (Kääb et al., 2016). One other difference observable between
    the EF derived by disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS is the sharpness of the latter (Fig.
    6). This is due to the Landsat LST being resampled to 30 m from the acquisition
    resolution of between 60 m and 120 m (depending on the Landsat satellite), while
    the MODIS LST is sharpened using the Landsat reflectance observations which are
    acquired at 30 m resolution. When sharpening Sentinel-3 TIR data with Sentinel-2
    optical data an even sharper (20 m resolution) image should be obtained. 4.4.
    Temporal pattern comparison One of the main reasons for obtaining high-resolution
    estimates of land surface energy fluxes is to be able to follow the temporal evolution
    of agricultural water use and plant water stress at field scale. Therefore, it
    is important to evaluate how accurately the fluxes estimated with sharpened LST
    can follow that temporal evolution. Similarly to Section 4.3 we use EF for this
    evaluation and consider the fluxes derived with Landsat LST as the reference dataset.
    For both types of LST inputs the TSEB model was driven by tower-based meteorological
    observations and the disaggregation approach was used. Fig. 8 shows the temporal
    evolution of EF for two agricultural fields throughout the study period. The relative
    location and size of the two fields (labelled (a) and (b)) are shown in the left
    panel of Fig. 9. It can be seen that both fields are much smaller than the spatial
    resolution of MODIS and SLSTR thermal observations (around 1 km) and that the
    distance between them is on the order of one low-resolution LST pixel. It can
    also be seen in Fig. 9 that the two fields do not always follow the same cultivation
    calendar. Despite this, EF modelled with sharpened LST is able to follow quite
    closely the temporal pattern of the reference EF, with r of 0.87 and Root Mean
    Square Difference (RMSD) of 0.08 for field (a) and r of 0.83 and RMSD of 0.09
    for field (b). Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    web version of this article.) However, upon closer inspection some deficiencies
    of the sharpened LST approach become evident. Fig. 9 shows that while in the 2013
    growing season field (a) remained essentially bare until June (with crop cover
    visible only in the image from 21.07.2013), field (b) was sown with winter crop
    the previous season and so was covered with green vegetation from May through
    June and then being already harvested for the image on July. The EF shown on the
    right end of Fig. 8 reflects this temporal sequence in case of model runs using
    Landsat LST (disTSEBL - red crosses) but not necessarily when using sharpened
    LST (disTSEBM,DMS - green x’es). In field (a) disTSEBL EF starts around 0.6 at
    the beginning of May 2013 then drops to 0.4 and gradually increases to 0.5 as
    the vegetation grows, while in field (b) it remains around 0.6 throughout May
    and June 2013 as the green vegetation matures and drops to around 0.4 at the end
    of July when the field does not contain photosynthetic vegetation anymore. disTSEBM,DMS
    EF follows the reference EF quite closely in field (a), with the exception of
    the estimate at end of May 2013 when it is overestimated, but in field (b) drops
    to 0.4 at the end of May and remains constant during the following two modelled
    dates. Especially in field (b) the behaviour of disTSEBL EF appears more realistic,
    which might indicate that the sharpened LST is not able to fully capture the dynamics
    of this field. 4.5. Comparison of fluxes derived with sharpened Sentinel-3 LST
    and Landsat LST at regional scale The suitability of applying the proposed methodology
    for deriving high-resolution fluxes with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 images was
    also evaluated. The scenes were acquired on the morning of 17th of May 2017 and
    cover an agricultural area in the Po Valley in northern Italy. A Landsat-8 (L8)
    image was acquired over the area on the same morning, allowing for comparison
    of high-resolution fluxes estimated using S3 LST sharpened with S2 optical data
    against fluxes estimated using L8 LST in a region of interest (ROI) of 83 km by
    40 km (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (880KB) Download : Download

    Land surface energy fluxes were first derived at the Sentinel-3 resolution using
    the TSEB model and then at the Sentinel-2 resolution using the TSEB model and
    the disaggregation approach. The S3 LST was obtained following the split-window
    approach proposed by Sobrino et al. (2016b). For high-resolution application the
    LST was sharpened to 20 m using the DMS approach and all 12 S2 bands, atmospherically
    corrected using Sen2Cor tool (Louis et al., 2016) and (in case of bands with different
    spatial resolution) resampled to 20 m. LAI was retrieved from the atmospherically
    corrected Sentinel-2 reflectances using the biophysical processor available in
    the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software and resampled to S3 resolution
    for the low-resolution run. Due to the lack of established S2 or S3 albedo product
    or algorithm, the albedo data was taken from a MODIS MCD43A3 product and resampled
    for the S3 resolution run or sharpened with DMS for the S2 resolution run. The
    meteorological inputs were taken from the ECMWF analysis data which is included
    in the Sentinel-3 SLSTR data file, with the exception of incoming shortwave radiation
    which was estimated using the approach of Weiss and Norman (1985). The landcover-based
    parameters were set according to reclassified Corine map, as described in Section
    3.3. To derive the reference high-resolution fluxes the same inputs were used
    except DMS-sharpened S3 LST was replaced with L8 LST. Maps of latent heat flux
    derived using Sentinel-3 LST, DMS-sharpened Sentinel-3 LST and Landsat-8 LST of
    three zoomed-in subsets of the ROI are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that at
    the original S3 resolution it is not possible to distinguish fluxes coming from
    individual fields or natural landscape features (e.g. riparian zones). However,
    at the S2 resolution those features become quite apparent both when using sharpened
    S3 LST and L8 LST. The spatial patterns shown in the two high-resolution latent
    heat flux maps are quite similar, although the fluxes estimated using L8 LST show
    larger dynamic range. Download : Download high-res image (887KB) Download : Download

    evaporative fraction for all the agricultural pixels within the ROI (over 7 million
    points) are shown in Fig. 12. The plot and statistics for latent heat flux confirm
    the findings described above: the correlation between LE modelled with the two
    types of LST is high (0.89) and using DMS sharpened S3 LST leads to underestimation
    of high-value fluxes and overestimation of low-value fluxes. The correlation between
    the sensible heat fluxes is significantly lower (0.67) which leads to the correlation
    between EF estimates to lie between the two values (0.79). It is not immediately
    clear why the correlation of H is so much lower than that of the other fluxes
    (correlations of G and Rn are 0.99 and 0.90 respectively). However, the response
    of the TSEB model to the changes in input LST is non-linear and this contributes
    to the different correlations of the different fluxes. Download : Download high-res

    5. Discussion 5.1. Potential for applicability in operational setting High resolution
    estimates of evapotranspiration have many operational uses, in particular in the
    domains of agriculture and water resources management (Anderson et al., 2012).
    For example, they allow for field-scale water accounting or precision irrigation.
    In Section 4 we have shown that by using 1 km LST sharpened to 30 m it is possible
    to obtain instantaneous ET estimates at field scale with a relative RMSE of 15%
    (when using local meteorological observations) to 19% (when using reanalysis meteorological
    fields). The bias of the modelled ET is significantly smaller and those errors
    should reduce when instantaneous outputs are averaged to daily, weekly or monthly
    values. This level of accuracy is similar to what is achieved with field measurements
    and therefore the estimates can be considered as reliable for water accounting
    (Karimi et al., 2015). It was also demonstrated that fluxes derived using sharpened
    low-resolution (Terra or Sentinel-3) LST capture the spatial patterns of fluxes
    derived using high-resolution (Landsat) LST well but with a narrower dynamic range
    if the optimal conditions for sharpening are not met. The temporal patterns shown
    by the two types of modelled fluxes are also similar. This confirms the applicability
    of the proposed method to be used with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to obtain
    high-resolution evapotranspiration estimates. At both sites the fluxes derived
    from sharpening the low-resolution estimates (TSEB-DMSM) were not as accurate
    as the fluxes derived with sharpened LST (disTSEBM,DMS), with the exception of
    LE at the agricultural site where the RMSE of the two runs was the same. This
    indicates that it is preferable to sharpen the low-resolution data (in case of
    this study LAI, LST and albedo) and use them as inputs to the TSEB model, rather
    than sharpening the TSEB model outputs using DMS to achieve higher spatial resolution
    flux estimates. In case of applications utilising S2 data, LAI (and possibly albedo)
    can be derived directly at fine resolution (see Section 4.5) thus improving the
    high-resolution model parametrization. Furthermore, sharpening the fluxes directly
    may cause a lack of energy closure at fine scale that needs to be taken into account.
    In the current study reanalysis meteorological dataset (ERA-Interim) was used.
    These data are usually released with up to 3 months delay, which is fine in case
    of end-of-season water accounting but not suitable for irrigation advice. In that
    case another meteorological dataset, e.g. ECMWF forecast products (Andersson,
    2015) would have to be used. This could have a significant impact on the modelled
    flux accuracy, especially if the forecast air temperature or wind speed are not
    well captured and this should be evaluated in future studies. In case of regional
    or local applications, it is possible to use near-real-time observations from
    ground stations and thus avoid this issue. 5.2. Limitations of the proposed approach
    The approach to sharpen low-resolution LST with high-resolution optical data is
    based on the assumption that there exists a statistical relation between the two
    dataset. The sharpening methodology used in this study (see Section 2.1) permits
    this relation to be non-linear and even very complex but it still must exist.
    While there is no general, globally transferable relation between TIR and optical
    data, it is possible to derive it when the two datasets are limited in space and
    time. This study shows that in such localised cases it is possible to use the
    sharpened LST to derive the land surface fluxes at high spatial resolution with
    acceptable accuracy. However, even then the range of high-resolution fluxes will
    not be as large as it would be if high-resolution LST observations were used,
    due to the aggregating effect present in the low-resolution observations. Another
    inherent limitation of estimating ET using DMS sharpened LST is the underlying
    assumption that the TIR and optical datasets contain the same or related information
    about the modelled physical phenomena. In practice they might contain complementary
    information. For example, crop water stress can be observed in the TIR domain
    some weeks before it becomes visible in the optical domain but both types of observations
    are required to map the water stress in different stages of the crop phenological
    cycle (Hoffmann et al., 2016a). On the other hand, Sentinel-2 bands in the shortwave
    infrared (SWIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum do contain information about
    vegetation water content (Ceccato et al., 2001) and (under certain assumptions)
    about soil water content (Sadeghi et al., 2017). Therefore, more research is required
    to determine whether the DMS sharpened LST is suitable for applications such as
    early detection of vegetation water stress and precision irrigation, in which
    crops are subject to certain stress without provoking a decrease in yield/biomass.
    In other applications, such as in regional field-scale water use mapping (e.g.
    Senay et al. (2016)) the use of sharpened LST as input to ET models should produce
    acceptable results. The above mentioned limitations, together with results presented
    in Section 4, point to the need for direct high-resolution TIR observations to
    complement the existing capabilities of the Sentinel satellite constellation.
    While the methodology proposed in this study is valuable for filling in the currently
    present data gap, it does so with a reduced accuracy compared to what would be
    possible with a high-resolution TIR sensor and might not be suitable for all TIR-based
    applications. Further research into different types of sharpening procedures and
    ET models will probably improve on the results presented in this study but it
    is highly unlikely that the need for high-resolution evapotranspiration estimations
    will ever be fully met without a dedicated high-resolution TIR sensor. 6. Conclusion
    The Sentinel constellation of satellites provides a suit of observational capabilities
    for operational use in agricultural applications. However, one currently missing
    feature is high-resolution TIR sensor which could be used to (among other applications)
    estimate evapotranspiration and water use at field scale. This study evaluates
    a method to fill this data gap by sharpening low-resolution TIR observations from
    Sentinel-3 satellites using high-resolution optical observations from Sentinel-2
    satellites. The evaluation is performed at two study sites, both located in a
    temperate climatic zone: an agricultural site with field sizes smaller than low-resolution
    pixel size and plantation forest site larger than low-resolution pixel size. Due
    to lack of long enough timeseries of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations and
    due to the need for high-resolution TIR data to use for benchmarking, the method
    was evaluated using MODIS and Landsat observations and later applied to Sentinel-3
    and Sentinel-2 images to confirm its applicability to this type of data. The results
    at the agricultural site indicate that although the fluxes derived using sharpened
    LST are not as accurate as those derived using high-resolution LST, they are still
    an improvement compared to low-resolution fluxes. For most accurate results the
    fluxes derived using sharpened LST should be refined with a disaggregation scheme
    which utilises low-resolution fluxes. Sharpening the low-resolution fluxes directly
    did not produce as good results. The fluxes derived with sharpened LST are able
    to satisfactorily capture the spatial patterns of different evapotranspiration
    rates of the different small-sized fields (although with reduced range), especially
    when high contrast is present within the scene. The temporal evolution of evaporative
    fraction throughout multiple growing seasons is also generally well represented
    when using sharpened LST even though certain critical events are missed. At the
    forest site the utility of sharpened LST is harder to evaluate due to the nature
    of the site (homogeneous at coarse scale but heterogeneous at fine scale) and
    the difficulties in modelling ET in forest ecosystems. Follow on studies are planned,
    which will utilise purely Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations and which will
    be conducted in irrigated croplands located in semi-arid and Mediterranean climates,
    where high LST contrast should be present at both low and high spatial resolutions
    and where water conservation issues are most critical. In addition, different
    LST sharpening techniques and ET modelling schemes will be tested. This study
    demonstrates that although modern data fusion techniques can be employed to partially
    compensate for the current lack of high-resolution TIR observations from Sentinel
    satellites, they cannot fully cover this data gap. Therefore, Sentinel constellation
    should be complemented with TIR observations at high spatial (and temporal) resolution
    to optimally exploit the existing capabilities in agricultural applications. Software

    \ advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water\nstatus\
    \ are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation.\
    \ This paper summarises\nthe use of remote sensing for the estimation of water\
    \ status in horticultural crops. The remote\nmeasurements of the water potential,\
    \ soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and\nvigour for water\
    \ status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters\n\
    directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically\
    \ important for irrigation\nmanagement in farms. The review is organised into\
    \ four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;\n(ii) the remote sensor suite;\
    \ (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of\n\
    water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural\
    \ crops. Finally, the\nauthors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects\
    \ and research gaps in the estimation of the\ncrop water status for precision\
    \ irrigation.\nKeywords: UAS; UAV; drone; unmanned; satellite; water stress; irrigation;\
    \ vegetation index\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the water status of crops is\
    \ important for optimal management and application\nof water to accommodate for\
    \ inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as\nmaximum\
    \ water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of\
    \ optimal water\nmanagement in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become\
    \ increasingly important in light\nof recent water scarcities through reduced\
    \ allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater\nareas under production\
    \ [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to\n\
    the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change\
    \ coupled with the\nnecessity to increase food production due to an increase in\
    \ global population has placed pressure on\nhorticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies\
    \ in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].\nHorticultural\
    \ crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water\
    \ resources.\nInformed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing\
    \ crop quality and yield are\nthe primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture.\
    \ These goals can be achieved by improving\nour understanding of the water status\
    \ of the crops at key phenological stages of development.\nTraditional decision-making\
    \ for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from\na combination\
    \ of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments\
    \ of\nsoil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements\
    \ of crop water\nstatus using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques\
    \ [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine\nground-based measurements, e.g., pressure\
    \ chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make\ndecisions on irrigation\
    \ [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010140\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 35\ncumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable\
    \ amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the\nmeasured leaf is assumed to represent\
    \ the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and\na few crops are\
    \ assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block.\
    \ As a\nresult, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit\
    \ quality [19–22]. This is\nespecially evident for non-homogenous blocks where\
    \ spatial variability of soil and water status is\nexpected [23–25].\nTo address\
    \ some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement\ntechniques\
    \ were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger\
    \ area, and\non a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned\
    \ aircraft systems (UAS), presents a\nﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors\
    \ as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure\ncrop water status [30].\
    \ Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used\n\
    to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers\
    \ to more eﬃciently\nschedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply).\
    \ In this regard, UAS platforms provide a\nconvenient methodology to monitor the\
    \ water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at\nthe canopy level\
    \ [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based\
    \ remote\nsensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].\n\
    This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand\
    \ the\ncrop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance),\
    \ soil moisture, ET, and\nphysiological attributes, all of which can contribute\
    \ to understanding the crop’s water status to\nimplement precision irrigation.\
    \ Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,\na comparison\
    \ has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation\n\
    satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information.\
    \ In the following sections,\nwe provide an overview of the most common remote\
    \ sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors\nused for remote sensing,\
    \ and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote\n\
    sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed\
    \ by an overview of\nthe current research gaps and future prospects.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms\nGround-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous\
    \ water status measurement from\na spatial location. For decision-making purposes,\
    \ the data is generally collected from multiple\nlocations across a ﬁeld, which\
    \ allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].\nThis\
    \ scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone,\
    \ especially for water\nstatus measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and\
    \ observing farms at a larger spatial scale\nprompted the launch of several earth\
    \ observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude\nof 180–2000\
    \ km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently,\
    \ UAS\n(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground\
    \ measurements and\nrelatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41].\
    \ In the context of water status estimation for\nhorticultural crops, all the\
    \ aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the\nuser\
    \ requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage\
    \ and shortcomings.\nThe decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data\
    \ from one or more of these platforms will\ndepend on the spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful\nfor regional-scale\
    \ characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.\n\
    Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like\
    \ remote sensing,\nhowever, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move\
    \ within the horticultural rows obtaining\nwater status measurements of adjacent\
    \ plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a\nrelatively larger\
    \ area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].\n2.1. Satellite\
    \ Systems\nThe use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch\
    \ of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].\nThe subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos\
    \ in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n3 of\
    \ 35\nsystems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including\
    \ spatial and spectral\nresolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the\
    \ same families, with newer sensor models\nand improved capability, resulted in\
    \ the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,\nSPOT, RapidEye,\
    \ GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved\
    \ the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form\
    \ of the satellite termed Nanosat or\nCubesat has been developed, which can be\
    \ deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),\nenabling frequent\
    \ and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs)\
    \ [52].\nThe earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS,\
    \ RapidEye, and GeoEye,\nhave been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1).\
    \ These satellite system oﬀer camera systems\nwith spectral bands readily available\
    \ in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and\nthermal infrared\
    \ (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s\
    \ water\nstatus indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI),\ncrop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the\
    \ ﬁeld- and regional-scales.\nTable 1. Some satellite systems that have been used\
    \ to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nSatellites\nBand Numbers:\

    \ = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge,\
    \ WV = water vapour.\nThe reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop\
    \ reaching the sensor is recorded at a\nspeciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed\
    \ wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is called spectral\
    \ resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution\nindicates\
    \ the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface.\
    \ Commonly used\nearth observation satellite systems possess between four and\
    \ 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm\nFWHM spectral resolution. The bands are\
    \ generally designated for the visible and NIR region with\nextended capabilities\
    \ in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band\n\
    combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and\
    \ TIR bands [23,25,53,54].\nWith the plethora of satellite systems currently available,\
    \ user requirements on band combination\nmay be achieved by using multiple satellites.\
    \ However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the\nexisting capabilities\
    \ is not possible.\nThe ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image\
    \ is called the spatial resolution,\nwhereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates\
    \ a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,\ndue to their lower spatial\
    \ resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For\
    \ a\nsmaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single\
    \ row of the horticultural crop,\nor a single canopy, this spatial resolution\
    \ is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image\ncomprises\
    \ of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus,\
    \ the spectral\nresponse on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed\
    \ spectral signal from the canopy,\ninter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The\
    \ mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural\ncrops with large inter-row\
    \ surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving\n\
    the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial\
    \ resolution 10–15 m) to\nsuch as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does\
    \ not necessarily resolve single canopies of many\nhorticultural crops.\nCurrent\
    \ satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this\
    \ resolution\ncorresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example,\
    \ freely available Landsat-8 and\nSentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days,\
    \ respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n\
    4 of 35\nTerra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days),\
    \ its spatial resolution is relatively\ncoarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for\
    \ horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone\nrepresent\
    \ the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data\
    \ acquisition,\nthere are often delays in data transfer to the ground station,\
    \ handling, and delivery to the end user.\nThe end user then needs to process\
    \ the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can\nbe a combination\
    \ of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].\n\
    Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination\
    \ sensitive and\nweather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite\
    \ revisit day to avoid data corruption\ndue to, for example, cloud cover [23,53].\
    \ Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by\ncloud at any one\
    \ time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data\
    \ acquisition.\nTime-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal\
    \ adaptive reﬂectance fusion\nmodel, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion\ntechniques blend the frequent (however\
    \ low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite\ndata [62,63].\
    \ The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce\
    \ frequent and\nhigher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring\
    \ of water status.\nThe clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability\
    \ to capture data at a large scale and at an\naﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can\
    \ download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with\nthe satellite\
    \ data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle\
    \ (in the order of days\nto weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc\
    \ applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.\n2.2. Manned Aircraft System\nOperating\
    \ within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to\
    \ remotely\nacquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the\
    \ satellites) and over a larger region\n(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing\
    \ aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned\naircraft employed in\
    \ agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and\n\
    faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally\
    \ ﬂown lower\nand slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of the manned aircraft,\ncompared to UAS, lies in their ability to\
    \ carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,\nHySpex SWIR-384,\
    \ Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft\
    \ is,\nhowever, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling\
    \ inﬂexibility, costs, and\nproduct turnaround time. As a result, these platforms\
    \ are barely used as compared to the recent surge\nin the use of UAS, speciﬁcally\
    \ for horticultural crops [68–70].\nIn horticulture, manned aircraft was used\
    \ to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature\nand water stress using speciﬁc\
    \ thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)\nairborne\
    \ hyperspectral camera system [71,72]. This work found moderate correlations (R2\
    \ = 0.45–0.57)\nof ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72],\
    \ and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)\nof canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size\
    \ (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for\nremote sensing of a large\
    \ region was highlighted in recent work that characterised regional-scale\ngrapevine\
    \ (Vitis vinifera L.) water stress responses of two cultivars, Shiraz and Cabernet\
    \ Sauvignon, in\nAustralia [64]. Airborne thermal imaging was able to discriminate\
    \ between the two cultivars based on\ntheir water status responses to soil moisture\
    \ availability (Figure 1).\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n5 of 35\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140 \n5 of 35 \n \n \nFigure 1. Water status of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon\
    \ under similar soil moisture as captured from \nmanned aircraft [64]. \n2.3.\
    \ Unmanned Aircraft Systems \nBoth the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant\
    \ of UASs are used in agricultural remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages\
    \ and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this\
    \ regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their categorisation\
    \ \n[74], and overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters\
    \ [75], in the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors,\
    \ a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter,\
    \ among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree\
    \ of freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse \nVTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\
    \ the pros of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing, making \nthem a promising platform\
    \ for agricultural purposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the \napplication\
    \ of UAS, their future prospects, and knowledge gaps are discussed in [53,78–81].\
    \ While \nmany horticultural crops have been studied using UAS technology, the\

    \ variant of UASs are used in agricultural remote sensing.\nEach variant has its\
    \ advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, ﬂexibility, and coverage.\n\
    In this regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their\
    \ categorisation [74], and\noverview of structural characteristics, as well as\
    \ ﬂight parameters [75], in the context of agricultural use.\nDepending on the\
    \ number of rotors, a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a quadcopter, a hexacopter,\n\
    or an octocopter, among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can ﬂy with\
    \ a higher degree of\nfreedom [76], while ﬁxed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward\
    \ at a certain speed to maintain thrust.\nAs a result, rotary-wing UAS provides\
    \ ﬂexibility and speciﬁc capabilities, such as hovering, vertical\ntake-oﬀ and\
    \ landing, vertical (up and down) motions, or return to the previous location.\
    \ On the contrary,\nﬁxed-wing UAS ﬂy faster, carry heavier payloads, and have\
    \ greater ﬂying time enabling coverage of\nlarger areas in a single ﬂight [77].\
    \ Recently developed ﬁxed-wing UAS with vertical take-oﬀ and landing\ncapabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse VTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\n\
    the pros of both ﬁxed-wing and rotary-wing, making them a promising platform for\
    \ agricultural\npurposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the application\
    \ of UAS, their future prospects,\nand knowledge gaps are discussed in [53,78–81].\
    \ While many horticultural crops have been studied\nusing UAS technology, the\

    Both the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant of UASs are used in agricultural\
    \ remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis\
    \ sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this regard, the literature\

    \ overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters [75], in\
    \ the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors, a rotary-wing\
    \ UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter, among\
    \ others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree of\
    \ freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse \nVTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\
    \ the pros of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing, making \nthem a promising platform\

    \ spectral bands, and temporal \nresolution to collect data on any good weather\
    \ day. However, like satellite and manned aircraft, the \nUAS is inoperable during\
    \ precipitation, high winds, and temperatures. By easily altering the flying \n\
    altitude, the UAS provides higher flexibility to observe a larger area with lower\
    \ spatial resolution or \nsmaller area with much greater detail [103]. Temporally,\
    \ the UAS can be scheduled at a user-defined \ntime at short notice, thus accommodating\
    \ applications that are time-sensitive, such as capturing vital \nphenological\

    \ sensors and \ninterchangeability between sensor payloads; thus, any desired\
    \ combination of sensors and spectral \nbands can be incorporated to target specific\
    \ features. \nUAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be\
    \ incorporated into the grower \ndecision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images\
    \ currently has a turnaround time of \napproximately one day to one week, subject\
    \ to the size of the dataset, computational power, and \nspectral/spatial quality\
    \ of the product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance,\
    \ \nwhereas the spatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. \nHigher spectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric \neffects. Following post-processing of\
    \ aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be \nhighly correlated\
    \ with ground-based data [82,102,106]. \nThe most common UAS-based sensor types\
    \ to study the crop water status are the thermal, \nmultispectral and RGB, while\
    \ hyperspectral and LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) sensors are \nused less\
    \ often [23,79,107]. Spectral sensors provide the capability to capture broader\
    \ physiological \nproperties of the crop, such as greenness (related to leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content and health) and biomass, \nthat generally correlate with crop water\
    \ status [82,108]. Narrower band spectral sensors provide \ndirect insight into\
    \ specific biophysical and biochemical properties of crops, such as via photochemical\
    \ \nreflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF),\
    \ which reflects a plant’s \nphotosynthetic efficiency [109,110]. Thermal-based\
    \ sensors capture the temperature of the crop’s \nsurface, which indicates the\

    \ has a turnaround time of approximately\none day to one week, subject to the\
    \ size of the dataset, computational power, and spectral/spatial\nquality of the\
    \ product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance, whereas\
    \ the\nspatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. Higher\nspectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric eﬀects.\nFollowing post-processing of\
    \ aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be highly\ncorrelated\
    \ with ground-based data [82,102,106].\nThe most common UAS-based sensor types\

    \ pointclouds\nwith suﬃcient accuracy for canopy level assessment [111–118].\n\
    3. Remote Sensor Types\n3.1. Digital Camera\nA digital camera typically incorporates\
    \ an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.\nThe lens quality of the\
    \ camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 35\ncamera determines its spatial resolution and\
    \ details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad\nspectral bandwidth within\
    \ the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the\n\
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve\
    \ dimensional properties\nof the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of\
    \ the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on\nthe dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need\n\
    practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more quickly use available\nwater resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.\nThe evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the\
    \ spatial\nvariability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The\
    \ macro-structure of horticultural\ncrops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing\nplants, can be identiﬁed\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\n\
    conﬁguration in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM) generated from a digital\
    \ camera can also\nenable understanding of the water status in relation to the\
    \ aspect and slope conﬁguration of the terrain.\n3.2. Multispectral Camera\nA\
    \ multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nMost common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include\
    \ rededge and NIR\nbands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure\
    \ 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of\nthe spectral band is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\
    \ to perform\nwith consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric\
    \ calibration and atmospheric\ncorrection [123–125].\nTheir spatial resolution\
    \ has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural\napplications enabling canopy\
    \ level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as\nrelatively\
    \ low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n7 of 35 \n \nof the camera determines its spatial resolution\
    \ and details within an image. The RGB camera uses \nbroad spectral bandwidth\
    \ within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received \n\
    at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to\
    \ retrieve dimensional \nproperties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure\
    \ of the field, and the spatial information. \nBased on the dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the \nresource need\
    \ practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more \nquickly use available water resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if \nirrigation is not sufficient. The evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be \nuseful to understand\
    \ the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements.\
    \ \nThe macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the \nfraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the \nallocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\
    \ configuration in the form of a digital elevation model \n(DEM) generated from\
    \ a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation\
    \ \nto the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. \n3.2. Multispectral\
    \ Camera \nA multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Most \ncommon airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which\
    \ include rededge and NIR bands in \naddition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g.,\
    \ Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral \nband is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural\
    \ \ncrops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\

    \ between the red and NIR band is unique to live green vegetation\nand is captured\
    \ by vegetation spectral index called NDVI (Table 2, Equation (3)). Once the vegetation\n\
    starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region\
    \ is reduced, while the\nreﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress\
    \ is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 35\n\
    easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations\
    \ with a wide\narray of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content,\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,\nand occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].\n\
    The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the\
    \ red and NIR\nbands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested\
    \ that the sharp transition between\nthe red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able\
    \ to provide additional information about vegetation and\nits hydric characteristics\
    \ [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge\nband\
    \ was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration\
    \ map [127]. Given the\nsensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications,\
    \ such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to\nthe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological\n\
    indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].\n\
    3.3. Hyperspectral\nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled\
    \ at a narrower wavelength intervals\nspanning from visible to NIR spectrum at\
    \ a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning\nat contiguous\
    \ narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional\
    \ (two\nspatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral\
    \ data cube. The hyperspectral\ndata cube is a hyperspectral image where each\
    \ pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire\nspectral reﬂectance\
    \ curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral\n\
    sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer),\
    \ whiskbroom\nscanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131].\
    \ A point spectrometer, samples\nwithin its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce\
    \ an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a\npoint [130,132]. A whiskbroom\
    \ scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a\ntime.\
    \ As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data\
    \ cube, and as the\nplatform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a\
    \ hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom\nscanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous\
    \ detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of\ntravel and scans the entire\
    \ row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive\nrows\
    \ form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent\
    \ scanning\ntechniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ [135,136]. The point spectrometer\noﬀers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [137,138].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n8 of 35 \n \nstarts to experience stress\
    \ (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the\
    \ \nreflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in\
    \ the vegetation profile and \neasily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this\
    \ reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide \narray of crops response including\
    \ vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, \nand\
    \ occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. \nThe rededge band covers the portion of\
    \ the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR \nbands where reflectance\
    \ increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition \nbetween\
    \ the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information\
    \ about \nvegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised\
    \ difference red edge (NDRE) \nindex, the rededge band was found to be useful\
    \ in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration \nmap [127]. Given the\
    \ sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought\
    \ stress \n[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) along with \nstructural physiological indices were found to be\
    \ useful to study water stress in horticultural crops \n[34,82,129]. \n3.3. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower\
    \ wavelength \nintervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high\
    \ spectral resolution (Figure \n3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths,\
    \ a hyperspectral sensor produces a three \ndimensional (two spatial dimensions\
    \ and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data \ncube. The hyperspectral\
    \ data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial \ninformation,\
    \ as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating\
    \ principle \nand output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can\
    \ include a point spectrometer (aka \nspectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner,\
    \ pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A \npoint spectrometer,\
    \ samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral\
    \ \nresolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys\
    \ a single detector onboard \nto scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner\
    \ rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of \nthe data cube, and as\
    \ the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral\
    \ \nimage [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors\
    \ arranged in the \nperpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row\
    \ of pixels at a time. As the platform moves \nforward, the successive rows form\
    \ a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager \nusing different\
    \ scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ \n[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral\
    \ sensors [137,138]. \n \nFigure 4. The data cube structure of different spectral\

    \ high resolution contiguous spectral\nsampling, possesses tremendous potential\
    \ to detect and monitor speciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses [139].\nNarrowband\
    \ hyperspectral data was used to detect water stress using the measurement of\
    \ ﬂuorescence\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 35\nand PRI over a citrus orchard\
    \ [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a\n\
    vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging\
    \ [140]. High-resolution\nthermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ was used to map canopy stomatal conductance\n(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards\
    \ where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the\nlarge volume\
    \ of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine\
    \ learning\nwill likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment\
    \ to model water stress [141].\nSee Reference [54] for a comprehensive review\
    \ of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect\nplant water status.\n\
    3.4. Thermal\nThermal cameras use microbolometers to read passive thermal signals\
    \ in the spectral range of\napproximately 7–14 µm (Figure 3b). Small UAS are capable\
    \ of carrying a small form-factor thermal\ncamera with uncooled microbolometers,\
    \ which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,\ntherefore, does not achieve\
    \ the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal\ncameras.\
    \ An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal\
    \ radiation\nsignal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as\
    \ raw data number (DN) values.\nThe result is a thermal image where each pixel\
    \ has an associated DN value, which can be converted to\nabsolute temperature.\
    \ A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms\n\
    and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in\
    \ the literature [23,53,73].\nThermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar\
    \ temperature of plants. The foliar temperature\ndiﬀerence between well-watered\
    \ and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for\nwater stress\
    \ prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform,\
    \ the\ncanopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large\
    \ scale.\nThermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is\
    \ the maximum resolution of\nUAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market)\
    \ and high price-tag [53]. The small number of\npixels results in low spatial\
    \ resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability\
    \ to\nﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective\
    \ spatial resolution may\nbe inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural\
    \ crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2\n640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length\
    \ when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m\nresults in a spatial resolution\
    \ of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,\nalmond,\
    \ citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120\
    \ m in Australia\n(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to\
    \ observe a single canopy.\nAnother challenge with the use of thermal cameras\
    \ is the temporal drift of the DN values\nwithin successive thermal images, especially\
    \ with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack\nof an internal cooling\
    \ mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the\nmicrobolometers\
    \ experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature\n\
    target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially\
    \ when the internal\ntemperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during\
    \ camera warmup period or during the\nﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in\
    \ cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user\nmay need to provide\
    \ suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],\n\
    shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera\
    \ [142], calibrate the\ncamera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.\n\
    3.5. Multi-Sensor\nTo carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be\
    \ considered that includes, in\naddition to the sensors, an inertial measurement\
    \ unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) for the georeferencing\
    \ purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in\na multi-sensor\
    \ scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This\
    \ has\nlimited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate\
    \ ﬂights for each of\nsensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying\
    \ higher payloads due to the much larger\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 35\nthrust-to-weight\
    \ ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement\
    \ in\nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload\
    \ 5–6 kg readily available) to\nonboard multi-sensors.\nWater status of crops\
    \ is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the\nphysiology\
    \ of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological\n\
    factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used\
    \ to acquire measurements\nof the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status\
    \ assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\ncombination of sensors found in the\
    \ literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR\nbands) and\
    \ thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status\
    \ of the crop\nusing various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural\
    \ properties, with the aim of\nimproving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].\n\
    4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture\n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely\
    \ Sensed Images\nGeoreferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed\
    \ images such that the pixels\nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the\
    \ images are correctly associated with their position on\nEarth. The georeferencing\
    \ process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known\nas ground\
    \ control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to\
    \ the aerial\nimages [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference\
    \ aerial images by using the\naccurate position of the camera, or by co-registration\
    \ with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].\nIn the case of UAS-based images,\
    \ the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended\nforward overlap (>80%)\
    \ between successive images.\nThe ﬂight path is designed to ensure the\nrecommended\
    \ side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured\n\
    series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique\
    \ to generate a 3D\npointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly\
    \ used SfM software to process the\nremote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan\
    \ and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the\nSfM software for assessment\
    \ of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model\n(DSM),\
    \ DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be\
    \ applied to any\nsensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral\
    \ cameras [126,164,165].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n10 of 35 \n \nsensor [126].\
    \ The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much\
    \ larger \nthrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155].\
    \ Similarly, recent advancement in \nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have\
    \ enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) \nto onboard multi-sensors.\
    \ \nWater status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors\
    \ including the \nphysiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and\
    \ vigour of the crop, and meteorological \nfactors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this\
    \ reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements \nof the different\
    \ aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\
    \ \ncombination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including\

    \ investigate the water status of the crop \nusing various indicators, such as\
    \ PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of \nimproving\
    \ the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. \n4. Techniques of Remote Sensing\
    \ in Horticulture \n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images \nGeoreferencing\
    \ provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n11 of 35\nThe complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral\
    \ observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,\nimaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging\
    \ spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and\nan IMU for georeferencing\
    \ the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,\n\
    generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation\
    \ in SfM to produce a\ngeoreferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].\n4.2. Calibration\
    \ and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images\nEnsuring consistency, repeatability,\
    \ and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent\nradiometric, spectral,\
    \ and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration\n\
    is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s\
    \ optical properties\nand shift in spectral band position are corrected during\
    \ the spectral calibration process. Radiometric\ncalibration enables conversion\
    \ of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.\nInﬁeld\
    \ operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance\n\
    from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance\
    \ aﬀect the\nradiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired\
    \ spectral response by the sensor\nmay not represent the change in plants response\
    \ but the change in incident radiation on the plant.\nThe most common method to\
    \ convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line\n\
    relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon®\
    \ or calibration targets.\nThe use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector\
    \ [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR\nsensor enables absolute radiometric\
    \ calibration to generate radiance [130].\nThe calibration of the broad wavelength\
    \ multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than\nthe hyperspectral. Generally,\
    \ multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such\nas NDVI.\
    \ The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by\
    \ the change\nin illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally\
    \ [29,101]. In this regard,\nradiometric calibration of the multispectral camera\
    \ has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and\nvicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180].\
    \ Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a\ndownwelling light sensor, which\
    \ is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.\nHowever,\
    \ the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on\
    \ multispectral\ncameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting\
    \ in unstable correction, indicating\nthe inability of the sensor to incorporate\
    \ the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].\nThe radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object\ntemperature\
    \ curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known\
    \ object\ntemperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy\
    \ and SNR of the camera under\nvarying ambient temperatures can be improved by\
    \ using calibration shutters, which are recently\navailable commercially. Furthermore,\
    \ for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires\nconsideration\
    \ to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference\n\
    targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181].\
    \ Temperature\naccuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets\
    \ three times (at the start, middle\nand end of UAS operation) and using three\
    \ separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].\nAdditionally, using\
    \ the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction\n\
    models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared\
    \ to uncorrected\northomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally\
    \ ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the\nﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots”\
    \ of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and\ncorrection of\
    \ the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143].\
    \ In this\nregard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of\
    \ thermal cameras onboard a UAS is\nprovided in the literature [143].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Data Extraction\nA key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared\
    \ to agricultural crops arises due\nto the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation\
    \ cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n12\
    \ of 35\nof the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution\
    \ of the image. Most of the pixels\ntowards the edge of the canopy contain a blend\
    \ of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,\nshadowed leaves, and inter-row\
    \ bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,\nsuch as\
    \ grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.\nThe canopy data from orthomosaic\
    \ has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based\napproach.\
    \ Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely\
    \ eliminated\nthe mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques,\
    \ such as applying global threshold\nand masking, have been used. Binary masks,\
    \ such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from\nthe sampling [82,84]. Combining\
    \ the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the\npixels associated\
    \ with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.\n\
    The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some\
    \ crops due to pixel\nheterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop\
    \ pattern variability.\nIn the object-based approach, using object detection techniques,\
    \ neighbouring pixels with\nhomogenous information, such as spectral, textural,\
    \ structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped\ninto “objects”. These objects\
    \ are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation\n\
    using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine,\
    \ random forest,\nand maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment,\
    \ OBIA has been adopted\nto classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186].\
    \ Consideration should be provided on\nthe number of features and their suitability\
    \ for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational\nburden, as well as to\
    \ maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability\n\
    between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in\
    \ object-based approach of\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed\
    \ to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].\nOther techniques found in the literature\
    \ include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been\ndemonstrated in palm\
    \ orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using\n\
    image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193].\
    \ Similarly, the gridded\npolygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS\
    \ and QGIS, can be used in combination\nwith zonal statistics for this purpose.\
    \ When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration\nwith the high-resolution\
    \ images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better\n\
    delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors,\
    \ which are usually\nlow in resolution, are generally employed along with high-resolution\
    \ digital cameras.\n4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status\nA crop’s biophysical\
    \ and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and\n\
    quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential\
    \ (Ψleaf), stem water\npotential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195].\
    \ With regard to horticultural crops, water\nstatus has been assessed using a\
    \ number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).\nTable 2. Commonly used vegetation\
    \ and thermal indices to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nIndicators\n\

    A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance\
    \ the energy\nﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both\
    \ biotic and abiotic), the rate of\ntranspiration decreases, which results in\
    \ higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to\nunderstand the water\
    \ stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation\n\
    with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables\
    \ mapping the spatial\nvariability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature\
    \ alone, however, does not provide a complete\ncharacterisation of crop water\
    \ status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,\ndepending\
    \ on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence\n\
    (Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf,\
    \ and gs in horticultural\ncrops [85,99,182].\n4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices\n\
    The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are\
    \ thermal\nindices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212].\
    \ These indices provide\nsimilar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of\
    \ numbers to represent the level of water stress.\nThe CWSI is normalised within\
    \ zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers\nbetween zero\
    \ and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications\
    \ to\nassess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond\
    \ [91,198], citrus [85,110], and\nothers [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between\
    \ the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the\ncanopy presents quantiﬁable\
    \ relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in\nEquation\
    \ (1) [208,212].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n\
    (1)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of\
    \ (Tc − Ta) which are found in\nthe water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy\
    \ transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,\nrespectively. Assuming\
    \ a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),\n\
    which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCWSI = (Tc − Twet)\n\x10\nTdry − Twet\n\x11\n(2)\nwhere Twet\
    \ is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry\
    \ is the\ntemperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be\
    \ well-correlated with direct\nmeasurements of crop water status in the horticultural\
    \ environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,\na correlation of CWSI with various\
    \ ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],\nand gs [18,90,100],\
    \ have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed\n\
    the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].\nCWSI is a normalised index, i.e.,\
    \ relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,\nwhich is speciﬁc\
    \ to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator\
    \ of crop\nwater status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties\
    \ of grapevines at diﬀerent locations\ndoes not conclusively inform that they\
    \ have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,\nthe degree of correlation\
    \ can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]\nwhere\
    \ early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover,\
    \ phenological\nstage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and\
    \ water stress [197]. Thus, water stress\nin a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location\
    \ and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique\ncorrelation with CWSI\
    \ and, therefore, needs to be established independently.\nThere are multiple methods\
    \ to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which\ncould result\
    \ in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to\
    \ measure the\ntwo reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be\
    \ estimated by inducing stomatal closure,\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n14 of 35\n\
    which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum\
    \ jelly e.g.,\nVaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata\
    \ and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.\nTwet can be estimated by measuring\
    \ leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the\nleaf, which\
    \ emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that\
    \ the stress\nlevels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity\
    \ to repeat the measurement for\nevery test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome.\
    \ In an alternative (second) approach the range can\nbe established based on meteorological\
    \ data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet\nmeasured from\
    \ an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents\
    \ a problem\nregarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar\
    \ to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic\nand optical properties [54,87]. The third method\
    \ uses the actual temperature measurement range\nof the remote sensing image [33,97].\
    \ This method is simple to implement, however, works on the\nassumption that the\
    \ ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry.\
    \ Fourth,\nthe reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving\
    \ for the leaf surface energy balance\nequations, however, are limited by the\
    \ necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].\nStandard and robust\
    \ Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,\n\
    especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to\
    \ the adaptation of diﬀerent\napproaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the\
    \ instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI\nis not known. Nonetheless,\
    \ adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for\nmonitoring\
    \ the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].\n\
    4.4.3. Spectral Indices\nCrops reﬂectance properties convey information about\
    \ the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has\nhigher reﬂectance in the NIR band.\
    \ Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,\nwhich provide\
    \ information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf\
    \ biochemistry,\nand water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral\
    \ data, several Vis, such as green\nnormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI),\
    \ renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),\noptimized soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI),\
    \ and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate\
    \ with the\nwater stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely\
    \ studied VI in horticulture, in this\nregard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).\nNDVI\
    \ = Rnir − Rr\nRnir + Rr\n(3)\nwhere Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,\nrespectively. In horticulture,\
    \ NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water\nstatus\
    \ of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore\
    \ remaining\ncooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when\
    \ unirrigated. With regard to\nirrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices\
    \ (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial\nvariability and to identify the\
    \ area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are\nnot\
    \ expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants\
    \ that are needed to\nmake decisions on irrigation scheduling.\nThe multispectral\
    \ indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have\nproven\
    \ to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water\
    \ stress [219]. The ratio\nof canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation\
    \ dryness index (TVDI),\nwas found to be useful for the study of water status\
    \ in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that\nvegetation with larger\
    \ NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under\n\
    stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water\
    \ stress, the TVDI is\nmore suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress\
    \ as the surface temperature can rise rapidly\neven during initial water stress\
    \ [200].\nSimilarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote\
    \ sensing of water status are\nPRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been\
    \ directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140\n15 of 35\nSeveral hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been\
    \ identiﬁed [139]; however, their\napplication in remote sensing of horticultural\
    \ crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to\nwater absorption\
    \ bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the\n\
    water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be\
    \ highly correlated with\nplant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as\
    \ deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely\ntrack the changes in the\
    \ plant water status of various crops [202,203].\nWBI = R970\nR900\n(4)\nOther\
    \ water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural\
    \ crops can\nbe found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess\
    \ the capability to reﬂect the\ninstantaneous water status of the plant, which\
    \ can be useful for quantitative decision-making on\nirrigation scheduling.\n\
    4.4.4. Soil Moisture\nThe moisture status of the soil provides an indication of\
    \ the available water resource to the crop.\nSoil moisture is traditionally measured\
    \ indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface\nof the soil.\
    \ A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution\
    \ of moisture,\nboth vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale\
    \ variability. For instance, the root\nsystem of some horticultural crops, such\
    \ as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,\nwhile customer-grade\
    \ soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil\n\
    moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are\
    \ point measures and\nnot necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation\
    \ of soil moisture across spatial and\ntemporal scales is of interest for various\
    \ agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and\nmicrowave remote\
    \ sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions\n\
    could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave\
    \ radiometry,\na component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown\
    \ to be a reliable approach to estimate\nsoil moisture via satellite-based remote\
    \ sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS)\
    \ [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].\n\
    The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application,\
    \ is their\ndepth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order\
    \ of tens of kilometre) [227–229].\nAs an airborne application, the volumetric\
    \ soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of\nthe GNSS interference\
    \ signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite\n\
    and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil\
    \ moisture across spatial,\ntemporal and depth scales.\n4.4.5. Physiological Attributes\n\
    Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations,\
    \ and canopy\nsurface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing\
    \ a delineation algorithm on the 3D\nmodels, the 3D attributes of the crops and\
    \ macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].\nCrop surface area\
    \ and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal\n\
    resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation\
    \ within an irrigation\nzone may experience a level of water stress due to the\
    \ gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.\nUsing the structural measurements, such\
    \ as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each\nrow, LAI, and porosity,\
    \ among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,\nlarger\
    \ canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area\
    \ [116,157]. Using\nthe temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the\
    \ vigour can be computed. Monitoring\ncrop vigour over the season and over subsequent\
    \ years can provide an indication of its health and\nperformance, e.g., yield,\
    \ within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to\n\
    horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption,\
    \ whereby canopy size\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n16 of 35\ncan be used to determine\
    \ its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,\n\
    width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning\
    \ of horticultural\nplants [116,119].\nLAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes\
    \ obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,\nhigher LAI is equivalent\
    \ to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy\n\
    transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water\
    \ requirement and\nproductivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such\
    \ as row and plant spacing, may assist in\ninter-row surface energy balance to\
    \ determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the\nstructural\
    \ properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can\
    \ serve as\nanother indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological\
    \ attributes have been used\nto understand plant water status and its spatial\
    \ variability, they have not been directly applied to make\nquantitative decisions\
    \ on irrigation.\n4.4.6. Evapotranspiration\nThe estimation of ET via remote sensing,\
    \ numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been\nextensively studied and\
    \ reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface\n\
    energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP),\
    \ water balance,\nwater-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.\nSEB models\
    \ are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated\
    \ as a\nresidual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The\
    \ models are either one-source\n(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for\
    \ the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source\n(canopy and soil surfaces\
    \ treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models\n\
    were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm\
    \ [248,249] and\nMapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized\
    \ Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].\nSEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect\
    \ ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing\nthe spatial scope,\
    \ while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using\n\
    hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g.,\
    \ MEP) models rely\non accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air\
    \ temperatures, which can be erroneous\nunder non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy\
    \ days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to\ncapture ambient air\
    \ temperatures required by the model.\nAmong the existing methods, FAO’s PM is\
    \ the most widely adopted model to estimate reference\nET (ETref or ET0) [252].\
    \ The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal\n\
    radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253].\
    \ Remote sensing\nprovides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional\
    \ to global scales [241] by estimating\nreﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation.\
    \ One of the advantages of using the PM approach is\nthat it is parametrised using\
    \ micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic\nweather\
    \ stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is\
    \ not dynamic\nas inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation\
    \ [241]. From a practical standpoint,\nPM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction\
    \ with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are\nclosely related to the\
    \ light interception of the canopy [254].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned\
    \ as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate\nETc measurements,\
    \ kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using\
    \ ET0 [255].\nIn this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing\
    \ to study spatial variability in kc and\nETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery\
    \ can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration\nrate is closely related\
    \ to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with\ncanopy\
    \ reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature\
    \ ratio, canopy\ntemperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above\
    \ canopy threshold, can be used to\nestimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found\
    \ to be the most accurate [24].\nET at a larger scale is typically estimated based\
    \ on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution\nof satellites is, however,\
    \ low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n17 of 35\n(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle).\
    \ In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in\nspatial resolution\
    \ for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation\
    \ of ETc at\nthe ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected\
    \ to have great application prospects\nin the future [240,259,262,263]. In this\
    \ regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates\nmay focus on temporal\
    \ downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],\ninterpolation\
    \ between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites\
    \ [25,260], and\nspatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example\
    \ of early satellite-based remote\nsensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration\
    \ Project (MOD16), which was established in\n1999 to provide daily estimates of\
    \ global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a\npair of NASA\
    \ satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs)\
    \ [269].\nThese estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux\
    \ tower estimates of ET despite\ndiﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with\
    \ each of these techniques.\nUASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral\
    \ and thermal imagery to compute\nET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271].\
    \ Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the\nshadowed-pixel is possible, which\
    \ showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in\ngrapevine [101]. Using\
    \ high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for\n\
    horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring\
    \ of ETc at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision\
    \ irrigation of horticultural crops in\nthe future [259].\n5. Case Studies on\
    \ the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection\nThe increasing prevalence\
    \ of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much\ninterest in\
    \ the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to\
    \ inform orchard\nor farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling\
    \ [272,273]. Traditional methodologies\nto assess crop water stress are constrained\
    \ by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying\nspatial variability,\
    \ high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both\
    \ inexpensive\nand portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274],\
    \ including through precision irrigation\npractices [1], result in higher production\
    \ eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement [275,276].\
    \ This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired\nfrom\
    \ remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural\
    \ applications of UAS\nplatforms for crop water status measurement were in orange\
    \ and peach orchards where both thermal\nand multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally\
    \ the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water\nstatus [102]. Here,\
    \ we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms\n\
    to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically\
    \ important\nhorticultural crops, grapevine and almond.\n5.1. Grapevine (Vitis\
    \ spp.)\nThe characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a\
    \ vineyard provides valuable\nguidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82],\
    \ and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently\ncharacterised by the use of remote\
    \ sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards\nfor crop\
    \ water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard\
    \ in Hanwood\n(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS\nplatforms began to be used in vineyards for\
    \ vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this\ncrop used a fuel-based\
    \ helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision\nA40M)\
    \ and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed\
    \ strong (inverse)\nrelationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed\
    \ strong correlations between thermal\nand multispectral VIs, and traditional,\
    \ ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and\ngs [182]. In this\
    \ study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8\
    \ versus\nboth Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable\
    \ indicators of vine water status.\nThermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI,\
    \ were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 140\n18 of 35\nthe day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig,\
    \ requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or\nnon-water stressed baselines\
    \ (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or\nNWSB\
    \ using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from\
    \ all canopy\npixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically\
    \ obtained from well-watered\ncanopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour\
    \ pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water\nstress indices have also shown\
    \ to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent\ngrapevine\
    \ cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the speciﬁc\nwater needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have\
    \ used UAS-based multispectral-based\nVIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].\nUsing UAS-based\
    \ multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher\n\
    accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral\
    \ indices based\nestimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).\n5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)\n\
    Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on\
    \ irrigation\napplications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with\
    \ seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].\nThe requirement for prudent irrigation\
    \ management in the face of decreased water availability is\ncritical for maintaining\
    \ tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based\n\
    remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water\
    \ status in almond\norchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree\
    \ the crown temperature data from\na California almond orchard; this temperature\
    \ was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence\nbetween crown and air (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study\nfound\
    \ a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same\
    \ authors conducted\na follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species\
    \ including almond. The negative relationship\n(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;\nmorning\
    \ measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger\n\
    relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation\
    \ of orchard\nwater status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of\
    \ UAS-based crop water stress data.\nBeyond the characterisation of crop water\
    \ stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to\nuse this data\
    \ to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.\n6. Future Prospective and\
    \ Gaps in the Knowledge\nPrecision irrigation is a promising approach to increase\
    \ farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable\nproduction, including for horticultural\
    \ crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms\n\
    alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks.\
    \ The automation\nof UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point\
    \ that even novice users can adopt\nthe technology with ease. It is also expected\
    \ that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing\nimages will become automated\
    \ to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal\nsolution\
    \ may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional\
    \ estimation and\nplanning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286],\
    \ proximal sensors for\ncontinuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to derive decision-ready products [84,282]\nthat can be used for making irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological\ndevelopments in\
    \ this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually\n\
    transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.\n\
    Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in\
    \ temporal and\nspatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can\
    \ deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit\ninformation of water status, the\
    \ size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.\nHence, further\
    \ improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers,\
    \ or zoned\ndrip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS\
    \ measurements. Nonetheless, the\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n19 of 35\nrequired resolution\
    \ of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of\
    \ the crop.\nFor ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution\
    \ remote sensing imagery\nmay suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].\n\
    Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based\n\
    approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical\
    \ and mechanistic\nmodels, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance\
    \ models, incorporate both direct and indirect\nmeasures of the canopy, therefore\
    \ establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a\nsimilar\
    \ approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing\
    \ models can\nbe improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.\n\
    Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally,\
    \ the advent of new\nthermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress\
    \ indices that are more sensitive to canopy\ntranspiration. The most widely-adopted\
    \ thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is\nnormalised to local\
    \ weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,\nthe\
    \ relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental\
    \ conditions\n(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident\
    \ radiation and high humidity) and\nphenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result,\
    \ corresponding ground-based measurements are required\nfor each temporal remote\
    \ measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal\n\
    assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation\
    \ of meteorological\ndata along with the thermal response using novel indices.\n\
    In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal\
    \ downscaling\nto achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may\
    \ be achieved by fusion of multiple\nsatellite observations, such as freely available\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal\nresolution will require\
    \ interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal\nmodels\
    \ of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually\
    \ satisfy the\nrequirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued\
    \ advancement and greater availability\nof Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate\
    \ method to capture high-resolution data at a higher\na greater temporal resolution,\
    \ which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural\ncrops [299–301].\n\
    Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect\
    \ to a\nnumber of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal\
    \ response, meteorological\ndata, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure\
    \ of the block (farm).\nClearly, there is\nan opportunity for a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques which\
    \ incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop\n\
    water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms,\
    \ hyperspectral\nremote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop\
    \ water status. A quantitative product,\nsuch as SIF, derived from hyperspectral\
    \ data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water\nstress [204,205,304].\
    \ In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances\n\
    in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of\
    \ SIF may be unique and\npowerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.\n\
    Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring\
    \ of changes in crop\nwater status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition\
    \ at critical phenological stages of crop\ndevelopment have been recommended for\
    \ irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid\nregions, irrigation\
    \ is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing\
    \ of\nremote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently\
    \ logistically unfeasible.\nThe fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous\
    \ ground-based proximal or direct sensors,\nincluding weather station data, can\
    \ potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.\nThis approach\
    \ will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms,\
    \ to\nestimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers\
    \ would beneﬁt from the\nknowledge of crop water requirements for the determination\
    \ of seasonal irrigation requirements to\nsustainably farm into the future.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n20 of 35\nOne vision for the future of precision irrigation\
    \ is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage\nirrigation water at the sub-block\
    \ level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and\nproximal data\
    \ acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status\
    \ and\nrequirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid\
    \ developments in cloud\ncomputing and wireless technology could assist in the\
    \ quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing\ndata soon after acquisition\
    \ [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to\ndevelop\
    \ smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis\
    \ for diagnosis\nand decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take\
    \ advantage of precise irrigation\nrecommendations using information sourced from\
    \ a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily\nschedule, continuous ground-based\
    \ proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be\nstored\
    \ on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with\
    \ post-processing\nalgorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications\
    \ [311,314].\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the\
    \ use of remote sensing to determine the water\nstatus of horticultural crops.\
    \ One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools\navailable\
    \ for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess\
    \ the required bands\nto study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites\
    \ are more suitable for scouting, planning,\nand management of irrigation applications\
    \ that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is\nnot time-constrained.\
    \ Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the\n\
    cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform.\
    \ UAS-based remote\nsensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level\
    \ observation achievable), coverage (over\n25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight),\
    \ spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using\
    \ a UAS platform.\nWe envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites\
    \ are used for planning, and UAS used in\nconjunction with a network of ground-based\
    \ sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.\nThe plant’s instantaneous\
    \ response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via\nindices,\
    \ such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example,\
    \ SIF),\nmaking them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Broadband\nmultispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous\
    \ water status of crops, making them\nsuitable for general assessment of crop\
    \ water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral\nimagery may be the\
    \ simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as\n\
    instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling,\
    \ further developments\nare required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed\
    \ indices to decide when and how\nmuch to irrigate.\nAuthor Contributions: Performed\

    \ The Author(s) 2022\nAbstract\nRobust information on consumptive water use (evapotranspiration,\
    \ ET) derived from remote sensing can significantly benefit \nwater decision-making\
    \ in agriculture, informing irrigation schedules and water management plans over\
    \ extended regions. To \nbe of optimal utility for operational usage, these remote\
    \ sensing ET data should be generated at the sub-field spatial resolu-\ntion and\
    \ daily-to-weekly timesteps commensurate with the scales of water management activities.\
    \ However, current methods \nfor field-scale ET retrieval based on thermal infrared\
    \ (TIR) imaging, a valuable diagnostic of canopy stress and surface \nmoisture\
    \ status, are limited by the temporal revisit of available medium-resolution (100 m\
    \ or finer) thermal satellite sensors. \nThis study investigates the efficacy\
    \ of a data fusion method for combining information from multiple medium-resolution\
    \ \nsensors toward generating high spatiotemporal resolution ET products for water\
    \ management. TIR data from Landsat and \nECOSTRESS (both at ~ 100-m native resolution),\
    \ and VIIRS (375-m native) are sharpened to a common 30-m grid using \nsurface\
    \ reflectance data from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Periodic 30-m\
    \ ET retrievals from these combined \nthermal data sources are fused with daily\
    \ retrievals from unsharpened VIIRS to generate daily, 30-m ET image timeseries.\
    \ \nThe accuracy of this mapping method is tested over several irrigated cropping\
    \ systems in the Central Valley of California \nin comparison with flux tower\
    \ observations, including measurements over irrigated vineyards collected in the\
    \ GRAPEX \ncampaign. Results demonstrate the operational value added by the augmented\
    \ TIR sensor suite compared to Landsat alone, \nin terms of capturing daily ET\
    \ variability and reduced latency for real-time applications. The method also\
    \ provides means \nfor incorporating new sources of imaging from future planned\
    \ thermal missions, further improving our ability to map rapid \nchanges in crop\
    \ water use at field scales.\n * Jie Xue \n \nJie.Xue@usda.gov; jiexue7@gmail.com\n\

    Agriculture is impacted by many environmental issues, \nincluding climate change,\
    \ and degradation of land and \nfreshwater (Foley et al. 2011; Hall et al. 2008).\
    \ In agricul-\ntural regions, water availability is one of the most impor-\ntant\
    \ factors determining crop quality and production. \nIn recent years, there have\
    \ been increasing demands on \nglobal freshwater resources for food production\
    \ to support \nthe world’s growing population. At the same time, fresh-\nwater\
    \ availability has become increasingly limited in some \nproduction regions due\
    \ to changing atmospheric condi-\ntions, aquifer overdrafts, extended droughts,\
    \ and increased \ncompeting uses (Ficklin and Novick 2017; Richey et al. \n2015).\
    \ To develop sustainable agricultural systems, there \nis a critical need for\
    \ accurate assessments of water use and \nincreased water-use efficiency. Agricultural\
    \ water man-\nagement requires detailed information about crop water \nuse and\
    \ soil moisture status at field scales, which is con-\nveyed by daily to seasonal\
    \ estimates of evapotranspiration \n(ET)—the main form of agricultural water loss.\n\
    Remote sensing data are well suited to providing accu-\nrate estimates of ET at\
    \ the spatial scales required for \nagricultural management, with low demands\
    \ for ancillary \ninformation and at low cost (Anderson et al. 2012). Over \n\
    the past few decades, a number of remotely sensed surface \nenergy balance (SEB)\
    \ approaches have been developed \nfor mapping ET that exploit the land surface\
    \ temperature \n(LST) derived from satellite thermal bands as a proxy \nindicator\
    \ of water status (Allen et al. 2007; Anderson \net al. 1997, 2004, 2007; Bastiaanssen\
    \ et al. 1998; Norman \net al. 2003). In particular, thermal-based energy balance\
    \ \napproaches are sensitive to rapid changes in moisture sta-\ntus and, therefore,\
    \ capable of effectively capturing vegeta-\ntion water use changes. This is due\
    \ to the fact that canopy \ntemperature tends to change faster under stress than\
    \ many \nother canopy biophysical properties reflected in optical \nimagery (Moran\
    \ 2004). In addition, thermal signals are \nalso sensitive to soil moisture changes\
    \ under low canopy \ncover (e.g., early season irrigation). A suite of optical\
    \ and \nthermal ET modeling systems form the basis for OpenET \n(Melton et al.\
    \ 2021)—a powerful tool for improved agri-\ncultural water management providing\
    \ field-scale ET esti-\nmates across the western United States.\nIn addition,\
    \ anomalies in ET (i.e., deviations of cur-\nrent ET from normal ET, as averaged\
    \ over a relatively long \nperiod) show great potential for identifying agricultural\
    \ \ndrought onset and impacts. The Evaporative Stress Index \n(ESI), defined as\
    \ temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-\nto-reference ET (fRET), has proven\
    \ to be a good leading indi-\ncator of stress, particularly in rapid onset, or\
    \ “flash” drought \nevents (Anderson et al. 2013, 2015, 2016; Otkin et al. 2013).\
    \ \nRegional ESI generated at 4–10 km scale over the U.S. using \nthermal data\
    \ from geostationary satellites has been demon-\nstrated its utility as an agricultural\
    \ drought indicator (Otkin \net al. 2018, 2019). However, the relatively coarse\
    \ spatial res-\nolution of these products in some cases may not adequately \n\
    separate the stress responses of individual land-cover types \n(e.g., crop vs.\
    \ forest) and cannot provide effective guid-\nance for field-scale irrigation\
    \ management. More recently, \nattempts have been made to generate ESI at crop\
    \ stand scale \nby using high spatial-resolution data (30–100 m) from Land-\n\
    sat (Knipper et al. 2019b; Yang et al. 2020, 2021a, 2018).\nTo date, Landsat has\
    \ been considered a gold standard \nfor field-scale ET monitoring and stress detection,\
    \ provid-\ning data in the visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared \n(VSWIR)\
    \ and thermal infrared (TIR) bands required for \nSEB modeling, all co-collected\
    \ from a single platform \nand with excellent calibration and registration (Ander-\n\
    son et al. 2012). However, the relatively low revisit fre-\nquency of Landsat\
    \ imagery (i.e., 16 days for a single sys-\ntem; Table 1) constrains full reconstruction\
    \ of daily and \nseasonal water use dynamics at field scales, particularly \n\
    during periods of rapid change including green-up, har-\nvest, intensive management,\
    \ and flash drought. Previous \nstudies have investigated the integration of other\
    \ thermal \ndata sources in addition to Landsat to improve temporal \nTable 1\

    \ (MODIS) provides imaging for \nET retrieval at coarser scales (~ 500 m) on a\
    \ near-daily \nbasis (Table 1). Fusing high-spatial/low-temporal resolu-\ntion\
    \ Landsat ET with low-spatial/high-temporal resolution \nMODIS ET timeseries (Gao\
    \ et al., 2006; hereafter referred \nto as “Landsat-only fusion”) has proven effective\
    \ in gen-\nerating ET timeseries with both high spatial and tempo-\nral resolution\
    \ over a range of land cover types (Anderson \net al. 2018; Cammalleri et al.\
    \ 2013; Knipper et al. 2020; \nSemmens et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2017; Yang et al.\
    \ 2017). \nStill, the accuracy of fused timeseries strongly depends \non the frequency\
    \ of the high-resolution ET retrievals \nanchoring the fusion process; therefore,\
    \ other studies \nhave investigated the utility of including other medium \nresolution\
    \ thermal data sources in addition to Landsat. \nFor example, Anderson et al.\
    \ (2021) incorporated ECO-\nsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on\
    \ \nSpace Station (ECOSTRESS) as an additional Landsat-\nlike TIR data source.\
    \ Xue et al. (2021) tested using TIR \ndata from the Visible Infrared Imaging\
    \ Radiometer Suite \n(VIIRS) I–5 band together with VSWIR data from Senti-\nnel-2\
    \ (S2; Table 1) for augmenting Landsat ET timeseries. \nBoth studies have demonstrated\
    \ the value of additional \ntemporal sampling complementing Landsat in improved\
    \ \nET monitoring.\nIn this study, we propose to combine ET retrievals from \n\
    ECOSTRESS and VIIRS I-5 with Landsat imaging to pro-\nvide even more frequent\
    \ medium-resolution ET sampling \ncapabilities (referred to as Landsat + ECOSTRESS\
    \ +  VIIRSI/\nS2 fusion). We evaluated the improvement in fusion results \nover\
    \ Landsat-only fusion in capturing disturbance events \n(e.g., rainfall, flash\
    \ drought, green-up, and harvest) in \nwhich the resulting changes in crop water\
    \ use are transient \nand not recorded in available Landsat scenes. These two\
    \ \nfusion approaches (Landsat-only and Landsat + ECOS-\nTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 fusion)\
    \ were used to create 30-m \ndaily ET datacubes for the period of 2018–2020 over\
    \ three \ndomains in California, U.S., sampling a broad range of cli-\nmate and\
    \ water management practices. The accuracy of \nmodeled ET timeseries is evaluated\
    \ in comparison with \nlong-term flux tower measurements collected over these\
    \ \nstudy domains. We also propose VIIRS M-band products to \nreplace MODIS (soon\
    \ to be extinct) as the new ET fusion \nbackbone and test its feasibility. The\
    \ goal is to lay a new \nfoundation for future enhancements to projects including\
    \ \nOpenET and ET-based drought monitoring, to demonstrate \nthe value of more\
    \ frequent thermal imaging, and to suggest \nmethods for multi-source integration\
    \ looking forward to the \nfuture medium-resolution TIR satellite missions. We\
    \ also \ninvestigate the effectiveness of ET anomalies in capturing \nthe impacts\
    \ of crop management practices and stress in water \nuse at both daily and monthly\
    \ time steps and sub-field scales. \nThe overall aim of this work was to evaluate\
    \ the capabilities \nof the multi-source ET modelling framework for reconstruct-\n\
    ing daily and seasonal ET dynamics at field scale.\nStudy area\nThe study domain,\
    \ as illustrated in Fig. 1, includes three \ngrape-growing regions in California\
    \ (CA), USA, that were \nsampled as part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote Sensing\
    \ \nAtmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment \n(GRAPEX) (Kustas et al.\
    \ 2018). The three vineyard sites \nare near Cloverdale, CA (site name BAR); near\
    \ Lodi, CA \n(site name SLM); and near Madera, CA (site name RIP). \nTogether\
    \ they sample a north–south gradient in climatic \nconditions due to variations\
    \ in precipitation, temperature \nand humidity, along with different grape varieties,\
    \ row-ori-\nentations, and soil types. The SLM and RIP sites are located \nin\
    \ the Central Valley, while the northern BAR site is in the \nSonoma Valley area.\
    \ The climate changes from north coastal \nregion to the southern Central Valley\
    \ with decreasing pre-\ncipitation and increasing air temperature. The BAR site\
    \ has \ncooler and moister air conditions, while the SLM and RIP \nsites experience\
    \ a warm Mediterranean climate character-\nized by warm days and cool nights (Knipper\
    \ et al. 2020). The \nprimary land cover type of the three sites is irrigated\
    \ vine-\nyards, surrounded with irrigated orchards and pastures, and \nunirrigated\
    \ grasslands (Fig. 1). In addition to the GRAPEX \nsites, flux sites on Bouldin\
    \ Island, CA sampling irrigated \nalfalfa (USBi1) and corn (USBi2) fields were\
    \ also included \nin our analyses to test the utility of integration of data from\
    \ \nmultiple Landsat-like platforms.\nThe Central Valley aquifer system that supports\
    \ irrigation \nin this agricultural production area is extremely stressed with\
    \ \nan annual depletion rate of −20 mm  year−1 from groundwa-\nter for the period\
    \ 2003–2010 and even higher during drought \nyears (Famiglietti et al. 2011; Richey\
    \ et al. 2015). The exten-\nsive groundwater extraction has resulted in land subsidence\
    \ \nin many areas of the Central Valley over the last decades, \npartially related\
    \ to regions where non-permanent crops and \npastures were converted to long-term\
    \ crops such as vine-\nyards with a relatively inflexible demand for water (Faunt\
    \ \nand Sneed 2015; Faunt et al. 2016). Possible strategies to \ndeal with increasingly\
    \ limited water resources include more \nefficient irrigation methods or converting\
    \ to crops with lower \nwater needs (Anderson et al. 2018). In addition, an improved\
    \ \nunderstanding of the water use changes associated with these \nmanagement\
    \ practices is urgently needed. Previous studies \n(Knipper et al. 2019b; Semmens\
    \ et al. 2016) focusing on \nthese regions have demonstrated that the 16-day revisit\
    \ of \nLandsat 8 was not enough to capture the vineyard response \nto stress.\
    \ Other studies showed Landsat sampling was even \nmore insufficient for crops\
    \ like alfalfa which have higher \n612\n \nIrrigation Science (2022) 40:609–634\n\

    \ to ET modeling (Anderson et al. 2021; \nXue et al. 2021).\nIn this study, we\
    \ focus on a 3-year period from 2018 \nto 2020 (2020 is a drought year), after\
    \ the severe drought \n(2012–2017) in California. This period was characterized\
    \ by \na variety of meteorological conditions and soil water avail-\nability,\
    \ with varying cropping and irrigation strategies in the \nCentral Valley. A modeling\
    \ domain of 90 × 90  km2 centered \non the target flux tower sites was used. Detailed\
    \ information \nabout each flux tower site is provided in “Study sites and flux\
    \ \ntower measurements”.\nMethods\nIn this study we use a multi-scale ET modelling\
    \ system to \ngenerate various ET data with inputs from multi-source TIR \nand\
    \ SR data. A Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach is \napplied to sharpen raw\
    \ LST inputs for DisALEXI to finer \nresolution. The output ET data on overpass\
    \ dates are fused \nto generate 30-m daily ET time series using the Spatial and\
    \ \nTemporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). \nFig. 1  Three study\

    \ in greater detail below and in “Data and analyses”.\nMultiscale ET modelling\
    \ framework\nThe multi-scale ET modelling framework used here is \nbased on the\
    \ regional Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse \n(ALEXI) model (Anderson et al. 2007)\
    \ and the associated \ndisaggregation scheme DisALEXI (Anderson et al. 2004; \n\
    Norman et al. 2003), which are built upon the Two Source \nEnergy Balance (TSEB)\
    \ model (Kustas and Norman 1997; \nNorman et al. 1995). The TSEB estimates the\
    \ surface energy \nbalance and radiometric temperature separately for the soil\
    \ \nand canopy components of each model pixel, partitioned \nbased on the local\
    \ fractional vegetation cover or leaf area \nindex (LAI). To reduce the uncertainty\
    \ in remote sensing \nthermal retrievals, in the regional ALEXI model, the TSEB\
    \ \nis used in a time-differencing mode by coupling with a slab \nmodel of the\
    \ atmospheric boundary layer to morning ther-\nmal observations collected by geostationary\
    \ satellites at rela-\ntively coarse spatial resolution (roughly 3–10 km). The\
    \ Dis-\nALEXI component of the framework spatially disaggregates \nALEXI daily\
    \ fluxes by applying TSEB to finer-resolution \nthermal data from polar orbiting\
    \ satellites. In DisALEXI, the \nair temperature is iteratively tuned at the ALEXI\
    \ pixel scale \nto enforce consistency between ALEXI and reaggregated \nDisALEXI\
    \ fluxes. This normalization process also ensures \nthe consistency between DisALEXI\
    \ fluxes from different \nsensors with thermal data acquired at different times\
    \ of day, \na key factor in successful multi-source data fusion. For more \nALEXI/DisALEXI\
    \ modelling details, the reader is referred \nto Cammalleri et al. (2013) and\
    \ Sun et al. (2017).\nMulti‑source data fusion scheme\nThermal data sharpening\n\
    In multi-spectral satellite imaging systems, the spatial reso-\nlution of thermal\
    \ infrared (TIR) data is typically coarser than \nthat of surface reflectance\
    \ (SR) data from the same platform. \nHowever, the TSEB land-surface representation\
    \ in ALEX/\nDisALEXI requires physical and spatial consistency between \nthe LST\
    \ and LAI inputs derived from TIR and SR imagery, \nrespectively. To achieve resolution\
    \ consistency between \nbands and platforms, the DMS (Gao et al. 2012b; Xue et al.\
    \ \n2020) approach was used in this study to sharpen Landsat-\nlike LST imagery\
    \ (i.e., Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS \nI–5 band) from native resolution (i.e.,\
    \ 100, ~ 70 and 375 m, \nrespectively) to 30 m and MODIS-like LST (i.e., MODIS\
    \ \nand VIIRS M-bands) from 1 km and 750 m, respectively, \nto 500 m. DMS is a\
    \ machine-learning algorithm that builds \nan ensemble of cubist regression trees\
    \ between SR and LST \ndata at the coarse resolution of the TIR bands and then\
    \ uses \nthese statistical relationships to predict LST at the finer \nresolution\
    \ of the SR bands. To conserve energy at coarse \nresolution, the residuals between\
    \ the actual LST and mod-\neled LST at coarse resolution are interpolated and\
    \ applied \nto the fine resolution LST image. VSWIR bands were used \nto sharpen\
    \ Landsat-like LST images, while NDVI band was \nused for MODIS-like LST sharpening.\
    \ It should be noted \nthat the purpose of MODIS-like LST sharpening is mainly\
    \ \nto reduce the bowtie effect due to off-nadir pixel smearing \n(Gómez-Landesa\
    \ et al. 2004). In this case, DMS was run \nusing NDVI, similar to the localized\
    \ TsHARP approach \nwhich was reported effective in prior studies (Cammalleri\
    \ \net al. 2014; Kustas et al. 2003; Semmens et al. 2016; Sun \net al. 2017).\
    \ Note that in addition to the enhanced spatial res-\nolution of LST, thermal\
    \ sharpening also improves the spatial \nconsistency between LST and SR (including\
    \ LAI, NDVI, \nand albedo) inputs for the DisALEXI model, which helps \nrelieve\
    \ spatial misalignment in data from different satellite \nplatforms or LST data\
    \ noise that may come from an imper-\nfect atmospheric correction. For instance,\
    \ a modified DMS \napproach (Xue et al. 2020) with a relaxed scale of energy \n\
    conservation was successfully applied to ECOSTRESS and \nVIIRS LST sharpening\
    \ to 30 m.\nET data fusion\nPeriodic Landsat-like and daily MODIS-like ET retrievals\
    \ \nwere integrated into a single 30-m/daily timeseries using \nthe STARFM algorithm,\
    \ which provides a feasible way for \nfusing remote sensing data from different\
    \ satellite platforms \n(Gao et al. 2006). STARFM combines high spatial informa-\n\
    tion from Landsat-like sensors and high temporal informa-\ntion from MODIS-like\
    \ sensors to generate data with high \nresolution in both time and space. The\
    \ STARFM approach \ntakes advantage of the continuous phenology changes \nobserved\
    \ by MODIS-like timeseries to benefit the predic-\ntion between Landsat-like overpasses.\
    \ In STARFM, one or \nmore existing Landsat/MODIS image-pairs collected on \n\
    the same date are used to predict Landsat-like images on \nother MODIS observation\
    \ dates when Landsat data are not \navailable. STARFM employs a weighting function\
    \ describ-\ning the spectral, spatial and temporal relationship between \nexisting\
    \ Landsat/MODIS image-pairs to downscale MODIS \nimages on prediction dates. One-pair\
    \ STARFM uses a single \nimage pair to predict images on dates surrounding the\
    \ pair \ndate, while two-pair STARFM uses two nearest image pairs \nbracketing\
    \ the prediction date. The application of STARFM \nin ET fusion has been widely\
    \ investigated over various land \ncover types and most of these works used one-pair\
    \ STARFM \ndue to its simplicity and flexibility in near-real-time applica-\n\
    tions (Anderson et al. 2021; Knipper et al. 2019a; Yang et al. \n2017). While\
    \ most previous ET fusion studies have used the \n614\n \nIrrigation Science (2022)\
    \ 40:609–634\n1 3\none-pair fusion method, in this study, we used the dual-pair\
    \ \nmethod described by Yang et al. (2022) as it has been found \nto generate\
    \ smoother ET timeseries with smaller errors in \nhighly dynamic agricultural\
    \ systems.\nIn this study, two categories of ET data with different \nspatial\
    \ and temporal resolutions were directly retrieved \nusing DisALEXI. One is high-spatial\
    \ low-temporal resolu-\ntion (30 m; periodic) Landsat-like ET including Landsat,\
    \ \nECOSTRESS and  VIIRSI/S2. The other is low-spatial high-\ntemporal resolution\
    \ (500 m; ~ daily) MODIS-like ET includ-\ning MODIS and  VIIRSM. The two sets\
    \ of ET data were fused \nusing STARFM, combining each dataset’s strength to gener-\n\
    ate ET datacubes at 30-m resolution and daily time scale. We \ntested two fusion\
    \ scenarios: (1) 30-m Landsat ET retrievals \nwith 500-m  VIIRSM daily ET; (2)\
    \ 30-m Landsat + ECOS-\nTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 ET retrievals with 500-m  VIIRSM daily\
    \ \nET. The two fused datacubes were compared with flux tower \nobservations to\
    \ evaluate the value added by the additional \ntemporal sampling from ECOSTRESS\
    \ and  VIIRSI/S2. The \ntwo fusion schemes were also applied in simulated real-\n\
    time scenarios based on one-pair STARFM. In addition, \nfor the first scenario,\
    \ we also fused Landsat ET estimates \nwith 500-m MODIS ET, which was used as\
    \ a benchmark to \nevaluate the performance of 500-m  VIIRSM ET as the new \n\
    post-MODIS era fusion backbone.\nEvaporative stress index (ESI)\nESI is a remote\
    \ sensing-based agricultural drought index, \ndefined in terms of anomalies in\
    \ fRET relative to a long-term \nmean. An advantage of ESI is it does not require\
    \ information \nabout the soil moisture status or rainfall, but rather diagnoses\
    \ \nvegetation stress via impacts of elevated canopy temperature \non the ET retrieval\
    \ (Anderson et al. 2011, 2007). Normal-\nizing by reference ET better focuses\
    \ on the soil moisture sig-\nnal, reducing the impact of seasonal variations of\
    \ available \nenergy and evaporative demand on actual ET. Here we use \nreference\
    \ ET for a short grass under well-watered conditions \ncalculated based on the\
    \ FAO-56 Penman–Monteith formula-\ntion (Allen et al. 1998). ESI has been demonstrated\
    \ to be a \nvaluable early warning indicator of stress at both regional \nscale\
    \ (Anderson et al. 2013; Otkin et al. 2013, 2019) and \nsub-field scale (Yang\
    \ et al. 2021a, 2018).\nAt regional-to-continental scales, ESI is typically calcu-\n\
    lated as a standardized anomaly relative to long-term base-\nline conditions.\
    \ First, fRET composites are generated within \n4-, 8- and 12-week windows moving\
    \ with a 7-day time step \nto investigate the drought impacts at different timescales.\
    \ \nThen standardized anomalies in the fRET composites are \ncomputed to highlight\
    \ differences in moisture conditions \nbetween years, normalizing each composite\
    \ interval to a \nmean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 using mean and stand-\n\
    ard deviation computed for that time window over a multi-\ndecade baseline period.\
    \ Currently, routine ESI products are \ngenerated over the continental United\
    \ States (CONUS) and \nglobally based on ALEXI ET, and have shown comparable \n\
    accuracy with other standard drought indicators (Anderson \net al. 2015).\nFor\
    \ sub-field scale stress analyses, a non-standardized \nfRET anomaly (named Δ\
    \ fRET) has generally been used due to \nthe shorter time-frame associated with\
    \ these analyses (Knip-\nper et al. 2019a; Yang et al. 2021a, 2018, 2021b). This\
    \ study \ninvestigates the utility of both fused fRET timeseries and fRET \nanomaly\
    \ (named ΔfRET) for stress detection, computed for \nthe 3-year study period at\
    \ both daily and monthly average \nscales.\nData and analyses\nStudy sites and flux\
    \ tower measurements\nEach study domain discussed in “Study area” contains one\
    \ \nor more flux towers equipped with eddy covariance (EC) \nand meteorological\
    \ sensors measuring surface fluxes and \nmicrometeorological data. Data collected\
    \ at six towers are \nused to evaluate model performance, model crop biomass \n\
    changes, and detect vine stress (Table 2). This includes \nfour GRAPEX towers\
    \ in irrigated vineyards, all equipped \nwith similar instrumentation (Alfieri\
    \ et al. 2019; Knipper \net al. 2020). The BAR012 tower is located in the Cloverdale\
    \ \ndomain. The grapes in this block are Cabernet Sauvignon \nand planted in 2010\
    \ with an area of 10 ha. The RIP760 \ntower is sited in the Madera domain, with\
    \ 31-ha Chardon-\nnay grapes planted in 2010. Measurements of surface energy \n\

    \ began in 2013 and in 2017 for BAR012 and RIP760, \nrespectively.\nFlux towers\
    \ SLM001 and SLM002 are within the Lodi \ndomain. Both vineyard blocks are planted\
    \ with Pinot noir \nvines since 2009 and 2011 with an area of 35 ha and 21 ha,\
    \ \nrespectively. The Lodi domain also contains two AmeriF-\nlux towers (https://\
    \ ameri flux. lbl. gov/), USBi1 and USBi2, \nlocated in the California Delta regions\
    \ (Bouldin Island). The \ntwo towers are situated in irrigated fields with USBi1\
    \ in \nalfalfa since 2016 and USBi2 in corn since 2017 (Anderson \net al. 2021;\
    \ Eichelmann et al. 2018). The observed fluxes \nfrom the two towers were also\
    \ used in this study to compare \nwith modeled fluxes.\nModel results are compared\
    \ to flux measurements from \nEC systems as observed, and with a correction for\
    \ energy \nbalance closure error, which is reported on the order of \n10–30% (Allen\
    \ et al. 2011). Following previous studies \n(Anderson et al. 2021; Xue et al.\
    \ 2021), a residual correc-\ntion approach was used at most sites, assigning the\
    \ energy \nbudget residual to the daily latent heat flux. At SLM001 \nand SLM002,\
    \ a modified residual correction was used to \nminimize impacts of nighttime shifts\
    \ in wind patterns from \noff-field (Anderson et al., 2018). At each site, closure\
    \ cor-\nrections were limited to 30% for days with closure errors \nexceeding\
    \ 30% of unclosed measurement. Modeled daily \nfluxes were compared with both\
    \ unclosed and closed tower \nobservations under the assumption that these likely\
    \ bound \nthe true flux value and provide a metric of uncertainty in the \nflux\
    \ observations (Twine et al. 2000).\nDisALEXI model inputs\nIn the DisALEXI model\
    \ component, CONUS-wide ALEXI \ndaily ET at 4-km scale (Anderson et al. 2007)\
    \ was used as \nthe baseline for disaggregation. Other major inputs to Dis-\n\
    ALEXI include remote sensing data (LST, LAI, and albedo) \nand meteorological\
    \ data (air temperature, atmospheric pres-\nsure, vapor pressure, wind speed,\
    \ and insolation). Moderate \nET at 500-m scale was obtained by applying DisALEXI\
    \ to \nMODIS-like data and used as the fusion backbone. Three \nsets of sub-field\
    \ ET at 30-m resolution were obtained by \napplying DisALEXI at Landsat-like scale.\
    \ In this section, \nwe provide a brief overview of the key inputs for each ET\
    \ \ndisaggregation scheme.\nDisALEXI‑MODIS and DisALEXI‑VIIRSM\nMODIS ET estimates\
    \ at 500-m resolution were generated \nwith DisALEXI (DisALEXI-MODIS) by disaggregating\
    \ \nALEXI 4-km ET using MODIS LST and VSWIR products. \nThree products from Collection\
    \ 6 were used: LST (MOD11_\nL2; (Wan et al. 2015)), LAI (MCD15A3H; (Myneni et al.\
    \ \n2015)) and albedo (MCD43A3; (Wang et al. 2018)). The \nLAI and albedo products\
    \ are at 500-m resolution, and the \nLST product provided at 1-km resolution was\
    \ sharpened to \n500 m using the DMS approach described in “Thermal data \nsharpening”.\n\
    The VIIRS instrument follows the legacy of MODIS and \ncollects imagery at two\
    \ spatial resolutions: 750 m (M-bands) \nand 375 m (I-bands). In this study, we\
    \ also generated 500-m \nET estimates using VIIRS 750-m LST data with DisALEXI\
    \ \n(DisALEXI-VIIRSM) and evaluated its performance in com-\nparison with DisALEXI-MODIS,\
    \ which has been used as the \nfusion backbone in all ET STARFM fusion experiments\
    \ to \ndate. DisALEXI-VIIRSM used instantaneous LST and emis-\nsivity version-1\
    \ swath product (VNP21; (Hulley and Hook \n2018)) constructed at daily timesteps\
    \ and 750-m spatial reso-\nlution, and sharpened to 500 m using DMS. Other inputs\
    \ to \nDisALEXI-VIIRSM include the 8-day 500-m LAI compos-\nite (VNP15A2H; (Myneni\
    \ and Knyazikhin 2018)), 16-day \n500-m vegetation indices composite (VNP13A1;\
    \ (Didan and \nBarreto 2018)), and 1-km daily albedo (VNP43MA3; (Liu \net al.\
    \ 2017)) resampled to 500-m pixel scale.\nBoth the near-daily DisALEXI-MODIS and\
    \ DisALEXI-\nVIIRSM ET retrievals were gap-filled and smoothed to gen-\nerate\
    \ daily 500-m ET datacubes (Sun et al. 2017).\nDisALEXI‑Landsat, DisALEXI‑VIIRSI/S2\
    \ \nand DisALEXI‑ECOSTRESS\nALEXI ET fields were also disaggregated to 30 m with\
    \ three \nsets of inputs from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 plus VIIRS 375-m \nLST, ECOSTRESS\
    \ plus harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 \n(HLS). The Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2\
    \ data used in this study \ncome from NASA’s HLS v1.4 dataset (https:// hls. gsfc.\
    \ nasa. \ngov/; L30 and S30 products) which provides a consistent \nsurface reflectance\
    \ data product from Landsat and Sentinel-2 \n(Claverie et al. 2018).\nFor Landsat\
    \ disaggregation (DisALEXI-Landsat), Land-\nsat 7 was not used in this study due\
    \ to gap stripes resulting \nfrom the failure of the scan-line corrector. Instead,\
    \ Landsat 8 \nSR and TIR data from HLS dataset (L30) were used to gen-\nerate\
    \ 30-m ET retrievals at Landsat overpass dates. TIR data \nwere atmospherically\
    \ corrected using MODTRAN (Cook \net al. 2014) and then sharpened using DMS from\
    \ 100 to \n30 m for consistency with the SR data. 30-m LAI was esti-\nmated by\
    \ downscaling the MODIS 500-m LAI product using \na regression tree approach (Gao\
    \ et al. 2012a) and Landsat \nSR data. 30-m albedo was derived based on a narrowband\
    \ \nto broadband conversion formulae developed for Landsat \ndata (Liang 2001).\n\
    The combined 3- to 4-day revisit of HLS makes it attrac-\ntive for ET mapping\
    \ at sub-field scales; however, S2 does \nnot collect the TIR data required for\
    \ ET modelling. VIIRS \nI-5 band provides TIR data at 375 m and near-daily temporal\
    \ \n616\n \nIrrigation Science (2022) 40:609–634\n1 3\nrevisit. The combination\
    \ of SR inputs from S2 and TIR from \nVIIRS has been successfully applied for\
    \ 30-m ET disag-\ngregation (namely DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2) on S2 overpass \ndates\
    \ (Xue et al. 2021). Given that the S2 SR data from HLS \n(S30) are co-registered\
    \ and spectrally adjusted with respect \nto Landsat 8 (L30) and resampled to 30-m\
    \ resolution, S2 \nLAI and albedo model inputs were constructed similarly \nto\
    \ Landsat. VIIRS I-5 brightness temperatures were down-\nloaded from NASA LANCE\
    \ and atmospherically corrected \nusing a single channel inversion (Price 1983).\
    \ The VIIRS \nLST data were then sharpened to 30 m by the modified DMS \napproach\
    \ (Xue et al. 2020) using S2 SR data as inputs. As \ndemonstrated by Xue et al.\
    \ (2021), 30-m ET retrievals from \nDisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 show comparable accuracy\
    \ with \nDisALEXI-Landsat, with performance slightly affected with \nlarger view\
    \ angles. As suggested by Xue et al. (2021), we \nremoved VIIRS LST data with\
    \ view angle greater than 52° \nin this study.\nThe final set of 30-m ET was ECOSTRESS-based\
    \ \n(namely DisALEXI-ECOSTRESS). ECOSTRESS is a \nthermal-only instrument, so\
    \ the SR inputs for ECOSTRESS \ndisaggregation have to be obtained from other\
    \ satellites. In \na previous study, Landsat 7 + 8 SR data collected closest \n\
    in time to the target ECOSTRESS LST date were used for \nET disaggregation (Anderson\
    \ et al. 2021). Anderson et al. \n(2021) found that the temporal separation between\
    \ SR and \nTIR inputs impacts the accuracy of ET retrievals. In this \nstudy,\
    \ we use HLS SR data instead to generate LAI and \nalbedo inputs because the 3-to\
    \ 4-day temporal frequency \nof HLS data are higher than combined Landsat 7 and\
    \ 8 \n(8 days). ECOSTRESS level-2 LST and emissivity (ECO2L-\nSTE) and cloud mask\
    \ swath products (ECO2CLOUD) were \ndownloaded from USGS Land Processes Distributed\
    \ Active \nArchive Center (LP DAAC) and gridded to the geographical \ncoordinates.\
    \ The ECOSTRESS LST data were resampled to \na 30-m UTM grid to match with HLS\
    \ data and sharpened to \n30 m using the modified DMS approach (Xue et al. 2020),\
    \ \nwhich was found critical to relieving spatial misregistra-\ntion and enhancing\
    \ the consistency in SR and TIR inputs \nto DisALEXI modelling. Anderson et al.\
    \ (2021) found that \nthe ECOSTRESS LST data at view angles greater than 20° \n\
    resulted in poor sharpening results. Therefore, we carefully \nscreened the ECOSTRESS\
    \ LST data exceeding 20° before \nuse and removed those with poor performance\
    \ from further \nanalysis.\nSpatial gaps in the generated three sets of 30-m ET\
    \ \nimages due to cloud cover were gap-filled using the tech-\nnique developed\
    \ by Yang et al. (2017). For days with \nmore than one 30-m ET retrieval, the\
    \ order of priority \nfor inclusion in the fused timeseries is DisALEXI-Land-\n\
    sat, followed by DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2, and DisALEXI-\nECOSTRESS since DisALEXI-Landsat\
    \ typically has the \nbest accuracy. For more details about DisALEXI-Landsat,\
    \ \nDisALEXI-ECOSTRESS and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2 model \ninputs, the reader is referred\
    \ to see Sun et al. (2017), Ander-\nson et al. (2021) and Xue et al. (2021).\n\
    U.S. Drought monitor time series\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) is developed\
    \ through \nthe integration of a variety of drought indicators including \nprecipitation,\
    \ soil moisture, groundwater storage, and local \nreports from field observers.\
    \ USDM timeseries data for the \nState of California and the Sacramento County\
    \ (Lodi) from \n2018 to 2020 were extracted from the National Drought \nMitigation\
    \ Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln \n(https:// droug htmon itor. unl.\
    \ edu/ DmData/ TimeS eries. aspx) \nand used to demonstrate the crop water status\
    \ under various \nrainfall and water management practices. USDM classifies \n\
    drought into five classes and maps them with numerical val-\nues: D0 = 0 (abnormally\
    \ dry), D1 = 1 (moderate drought), \nD2 = 2 (severe drought), D3 = 3 (extreme\
    \ drought), and \nD4 = 4 (exceptional drought). The timeseries show the tem-\n\
    poral evolution of percent area covered by each class within \na county or state.\n\
    Model evaluation configurations\nIn this study, the accuracy of ET retrievals\
    \ was evaluated \nin five stages. We first evaluate the relative performance \n\
    of 500-m/daily ET estimates from DisALEXI-VIIRSM and \nDisALEXI-MODIS, serving\
    \ as the daily backbone in the \nSTARFM fusion process. This is a necessary first\
    \ step as we \ntransition away from retrievals based on MODIS, which is \nnearing\
    \ the end of life. We then compare 30-m ET estimates \nderived from, ECOSTRESS\
    \ and  VIIRSI/S2 on satellite over-\npass dates with Landsat retrievals as a reference,\
    \ and with \nthe flux tower observations. To compare with tower obser-\nvations,\
    \ modelled 30-m ET were averaged over a 3 × 3 win-\ndow (90 × 90 m) centered on\
    \ the tower location (Anderson \net al. 2021; Xue et al. 2021), approximating\
    \ the flux source \narea which is typically on the order of 100 m, depending \n\
    on the tower height and surface conditions (Li et al. 2008). \nWe note that more\
    \ sophisticated flux footprint models (e.g., \nKljun et al. 2015) may provide\
    \ a more accurate comparison. \nWe moved the center of extraction by a few pixels\
    \ to avoid \nedge effects for towers located at field edges. For 500-m \nET, the\
    \ pixel containing the towers is selected to compare \nwith fluxes measurements.\
    \ Next, daily 30-m ET datasets \ngenerated from Landsat-only fusion and Landsat\
    \ + ECOS-\nTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 fusion are compared to investigate the \nadded value\
    \ of increased temporal sampling frequency by \nthe additional medium-resolution\
    \ ET samples. In this case, \nSTARFM fusion is performed in both retrospective\
    \ (two-\npair) and real-time (one-pair) modes to explore the benefits \nof the\
    \ extra temporal sampling for real-time applications. \n617\nIrrigation Science\
    \ (2022) 40:609–634 \n1 3\nFinally, the capabilities of the fused daily ET timeseries\
    \ \nin capturing rapid changing crop conditions are assessed, \nincluding changes\
    \ due to crop management practices and \nflash drought.\nStatistical comparisons\
    \ with flux tower observations \ninclude mean absolute error (MAE), root mean\
    \ square \nerror (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and relative error \n(RE = MAE/\
    \ <O>) where <O> is the mean observed flux. \nThe MAE is a better indicator of\
    \ model performance, while \nRMSE is more sensitive to isolated outliers (Willmott\
    \ and \nMatsuura 2005)—for the fused timeseries, both metrics are \nprovided for\
    \ comparison.\nResults\nEvaluation of DisALEXI‑VIIRSM 500‑m ET\nTo evaluate the\
    \ relative performance of the  VIIRSM and \nMODIS 500-m ET timeseries, modeled\
    \ ET timeseries of \n2018 from both DisALEXI-MODIS and DisALEXI-VIIRSM \nwere\
    \ compared with flux tower observations over the four \nsites in the Lodi domain\
    \ (SLM001, SLM002, USBi1, and \nUSBi2) (Fig. 3). Note that the 500-m pixel scale\
    \ is much \ncoarser than the footprint of the EC tower in each case \n(~ 100 m),\
    \ so we do not expect perfect agreement between \nmodels and observations at this\
    \ scale. Still, the comparison \ncan provide some insights into the relative biases\
    \ in compar-\nison with ET observations. In addition, Fig. 3 also provides \n\
    the comparisons of inputs to DisALEXI modeling including \nLAI, NDVI, and LST\
    \ timeseries. For NDVI at the USBi1 \nsite, we additionally have NDVI at 5-m resolution\
    \ from \nPlanet Labs in 2018, included only as reference (green line \nin Fig. 3)\
    \ to demonstrate the monthly alfalfa cutting cycle. \nThe daily LAI, NDVI, and\
    \ LST timeseries from MODIS \nand VIIRS show good temporal agreement, and are\
    \ broadly \nconsistent with variability in the Planet NDVI at USBi1.\nDespite\
    \ small biases seen on some days likely due to \nthe local heterogeneity within\
    \ the 500 m pixel area, both \nMODIS and VIIRS-based ET timeseries match well\
    \ with \nthe seasonal trends in the ET observations. The close align-\nment between\
    \ MODIS and VIIRS-derived ET highlights the \nability of VIIRS, as a follow-on\
    \ instrument, in generating \ncomparable 500-m ET estimates with MODIS and replac-\n\
    ing MODIS as a new moderate-resolution fusion backbone. \nIn addition, we notice\
    \ the outperformance of VIIRS over \nMODIS in capturing the observed ET variability\
    \ in a few \ncircumstances.\nFig. 3  Time series of modeled MODIS (black line)\

    \ the underestimation of ET from MODIS \nfor DOY 230–260 at the USBi1 site is\
    \ likely due to the \nabnormally high MODIS LAI retrievals around DOY 240 \n(Fig. 3),\
    \ which were physically inconsistent with the LST \ninputs to DisALEXI. The TSEB\
    \ land-surface representation \ninterprets elevated LST in patches of very high\
    \ LAI as a \nsignal of canopy stress, and accordingly decreases the tran-\nspiration\
    \ component of ET (Kang et al. 2021). Relative to \nMODIS, VIIRS in general shows\
    \ a better performance in ET \nat USBi1; even though the dip in LAI around the\
    \ DOY 270 \ncutting (see the Planet NDVI timeseries) is not reflected in \nthe\
    \ 500-m VIIRS estimates, the retrieved LAI values remain \nwithin a reasonable\
    \ range.\nAt the USBi2 site (corn), MODIS overestimates ET dur-\ning the DOY 150–180\
    \ period before crop emergence, while \nVIIRS better captures this dip due to\
    \ the higher values of \nLST retrieved during this interval (Fig. 3). Consistent\
    \ with \nthe high LST, there is no precipitation over this period. \nThe higher\
    \ native resolution of the VIIRS M thermal band \n(750 m) compared to MODIS (1 km)\
    \ may lead to some \nimprovement in capturing spatial details at field scale.\
    \ As \nan example, Fig. 3 compares  VIIRSM and MODIS 500-m \nET maps at USBi2\
    \ and SLM001, along with 30-m Landsat \nor  VIIRSI/S2 ET at the same day for reference.\
    \ While both \nMODIS and  VIIRSM reproduce the large-scale ET patterns \nseen\
    \ in 30-m ET, the  VIIRSM ET maps exhibit a larger spa-\ntial contrast than MODIS,\
    \ especially for the more hetero-\ngeneous USBi2 site. For DOY 170, the low ET\
    \ values at \nUSBi2 pre-emergence are well captured by  VIIRSM ET, but \nare not\
    \ by MODIS. By DOY 184, the 500-m ET values are \nmore similar near the tower\
    \ (Fig. 3), although  VIIRSM shows \na higher spatial variability than MODIS and\
    \ is closer to the \n30-m Landsat ET distribution (Fig. 4).\nWe further investigate\

    \ and 2019 and the regrowth trends in 2020 \nwere reasonably diagnosed by the\
    \ model with no a priori \ninformation on management.\nStatistical metrics in\
    \ terms of MAE, RMSE, MBE and \nRE between modelled and observed ET at daily and\
    \ weekly \nscales for both fusion schemes are given in Table 4. Both \nfusion\
    \ schemes give MAE (RMSE) of 0.52–0.69 (0.69–0.94) \nmm  day−1 at a daily timestep\
    \ for all four vineyard flux sites. \nThe results are consistent with the previous\
    \ ALEXI/Dis-\nALEXI-based studies at vineyard sites with RMSE ranging \nbetween\
    \ 0.7 and 1.0 mm  day−1 (Anderson et al. 2018; Knip-\nper et al. 2020, 2019a;\
    \ Semmens et al. 2016; Xue et al. 2021) \nand other remote sensing-based models\
    \ such as METRIC \nwith RMSE of 0.6–1.1 mm  day−1 (Carrasco-Benavides et al. \n\
    2012; Galleguillos et al. 2011). This also aligns with the \ntarget model error\
    \ of ± 0.8 mm  day−1 suggested by Seguin \net al. (1999) for the field scale of\
    \ agricultural and hydro-\nlogical studies. Irrigation decision making often occurs\
    \ \nat the weekly timescale, where MAE (RMSE) reduces to \n0.44–0.62 (0.56–0.87)\
    \ mm  day−1 due to time averaging of \nrandom errors. The model errors are more\
    \ pronounced at the \nUSBi1 and USBi2 sites relative to the vineyard sites, in\
    \ part \ndue to the inherent greater ET temporal variation at these \nsites (Xue\
    \ et al. 2021).\nAt all but the SLM vineyard sites, performance in daily \nand\
    \ weekly ET improved in terms of MAE, RMSE and/\nor MBE with the extra sampling\
    \ in the Landsat + ECOS-\nTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 fusion, as did the Nash–Sutcliffe\
    \ coef-\nficient of efficiency (not shown). At the SLM sites, per-\nformance was\
    \ slightly disimproved with the inclusion of \nECOSTRESS and  VIIRSI/S2 in these\
    \ retrospective analyses. \nAt these sites, the temporal dynamics were already\
    \ rea-\nsonably reproduced using Landsat alone, and adding the \nlower quality\
    \ supplementary retrievals (especially ECOS-\nTRESS, see Table 3) served to add\
    \ noise to the timeseries. \nIn future studies, a weighting scheme will be evaluated,\
    \ \nenabling differential strength of contribution to the fused \ntimeseries based\
    \ on sensor retrieval accuracy (Table 3). We \nnote, however, that the multi-source\
    \ retrievals do add value \nat these sites in real-time mode (see “Value for real-time\
    \ \napplications”).\nAdded value of extra temporal sampling\nCapturing rapid changes\n\
    At many sites, the Landsat + ECOSTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 \nfusion shows an improved\
    \ performance in capturing ET tem-\nporal dynamics than Landsat-only fusion, yielding\
    \ smaller \nerrors in comparison with observations. For instance, \nat the USBi1\
    \ site the incorporation of ECOSTRESS and \n VIIRSI/S2 data results in a reduction\
    \ in RMSE from 1.42 \nto 1.29 mm  day−1 and 1.21 to 1.07 mm  day−1 at daily and\
    \ \nweekly time steps (Table 4), respectively. The monthly cut-\nting of alfalfa\
    \ and following quick regrowing result in strong \nET temporal variations, making\
    \ it difficult for Landsat-only \nfusion to reproduce the frequent ET changes\
    \ due to insuffi-\ncient Landsat scenes. The extra ECOSTRESS and  VIIRSI/S2 \n\
    samples provide key complements to Landsat in capturing \nthe monthly peaks and\
    \ lows. Figure 9 shows one representa-\ntive example demonstrating the significant\
    \ benefit of extra \nsamples in helping capture ET dynamics. For the period of\
    \ \nDOY 90–210 in 2020, the alfalfa at USBi1 was cut three \ntimes on DOY 116,\

    \ \nDOY 100–115, the increasing trend of ET as the crop with \nincreasing alfalfa\
    \ biomass is not captured by Landsat-only \nfusion. The  VIIRSI/S2 ET estimate\
    \ on DOY 115 elevates the \nfused ET timeseries to be closer to the observations.\n\
    Additional ECOSTRESS and  VIIRSI/S2 samples also \nimproved ET estimates at the\
    \ BAR012 site, reducing rela-\ntive errors from 20 to 18% at the weekly timescale\
    \ (Table 4). \nFurther to the south in California, where clear-sky condi-\ntions\
    \ are more prevalent, extra sampling from ECOSTRESS \nand  VIIRSI/S2 did not lead\
    \ to significant improvement in \nthe overall statistical metrics at SLM and RIP760\
    \ site. Still, \nthese extra samples are important in better defining local \n\
    water use at key phenological stages during growing season. \nLooking in greater\
    \ detail at the multi-source ET retrievals \nin 2018 over RIP760 site in Fig. 10,\
    \ we can see the added \nvalue of extra sampling. For example, a few ECOSTRESS\
    \ \nsamples over DOY 210–240 facilitated a better definition of \nthe reduction\
    \ in ET timeseries during the veraison to post-\nveraison stage from late July\
    \ or early August (Kustas et al. \n2018) in which the irrigation was curtailed\
    \ (Fig. 10). During \nthis period, the vines are still actively transpiring with\
    \ the \nripening of the fruit until the grapes reach the required sugar \ncontent\
    \ by late August or early September for harvesting. \nIn addition, one additional\
    \  VIIRSI/S2 sample on DOY 87 \neffectively filled a large gap in springtime (DOY\
    \ 75–115), \nduring which there are no clear-sky Landsat overpasses. This \nperiod\
    \ of vine phenological stages from bud break to flower-\ning with low vine cover\
    \ typically has significant cover crop \nbiomass (Fig. 10). An ET acquisition\
    \ near the bud break \n(around DOY 90)—start of the vine growing season- is very\
    \ \nimportant for monitoring cover crop water use and in making \ndecisions on\
    \ initiating irrigation.\nValue for real‑time applications\nThe ET fusion results\
    \ in “Evaluation of fused daily time-\nseries” and “Capturing rapid changes” were\
    \ generated ret-\nrospectively by using all image-pairs available before and \n\
    after each prediction date. In this case, clear-sky Landsat \noverpasses may often\
    \ be sufficient to capture the ET dynam-\nics over vineyard sites in central and\
    \ southern California. \nHowever, for operational applications, only the image-pair\
    \ \nbefore the prediction date will be available, which tends \nto exacerbate\

    \ the Landsat-only fusion \nfor all sites except USBi2—the regression line is\
    \ closer to \nthe one-to-one line with a lower RMSE. For all four vine-\nyard\

    \ fusion outperforms the \nLandsat-only fusion, reducing RMSE by 9.1%, 14.5%,\
    \ 25.4% \nand 3.6% for the retrospective case and by 8.6%, 16.6%, \n27.2% and\
    \ 5.8% for real-time application, respectively.\nIn addition to these overall\
    \ statistics, we further use \nUSBi1 site in 2019 to demonstrate the increased\
    \ value of \nextra sampling in improving real-time ET estimates at both \ndaily\
    \ and weekly time steps (Fig. 12). Overall, the Land-\nsat + ECOSTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2\
    \ fusion exhibits improved \nskill relative to Landsat-only fusion in capturing\
    \ the tempo-\nral dynamics of measured ET for both retrospective and real-\ntime\
    \ schemes (Fig. 12). During DOY 220–280, the Land-\nsat-only fusion gives somewhat\
    \ different assessments of ET \ntemporal dynamics in retrospective and real-time\
    \ mode, \nwhile timeseries using Landsat + ECOSTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 \nfusion are\
    \ more similar, particularly at weekly timestep. For \nexample, for the week ending\
    \ on DOY 234 (DOY 228–234), \nLandsat-only fusion in real-time mode cannot project\
    \ the \nreduction in ET during the cutting cycle because it is using \nonly a\
    \ pre-cutting retrieval from DOY 219 (see Pheno-\nCam photos in Fig. 12). This\
    \ reduction is better captured \nin real-time with the multi-source timeseries.\
    \ Similarly, the \nregrowth pattern for weeks ending on DOY 241 and 248 is \n\

    vineyards during specific growing periods (McCarthy \net al. 2002). The moisture\
    \ stress factor fRET describing the \nratio of actual to reference ET is related\
    \ to the crop man-\nagement factor (defined as the ratio of actual water use to\
    \ \ncrop water requirement) often used in RDI to track the spa-\ntial and seasonal\
    \ patterns of vineyard water status in real \ntime. Figure 13 shows a comparison\
    \ between modeled and \nmeasured daily 30-m fRET timeseries over the SLM001 and\
    \ \nSLM002 sites. The modeled actual ET is extracted from \nthe Landsat + ECOSTRESS\
    \ +  VIIRSI/S2 fusion results and \nthe measured actual ET is computed from tower\
    \ observa-\ntions with closure. The modeled reference ET is calculated \nusing\
    \ regional meteorological data while the measured refer-\nence ET is computed\
    \ using flux tower measured data. Also \nshown are the remote sensing LAI timeseries\
    \ on both Land-\nsat and S2 overpass dates over the two sites (middle row), \n\
    indicating the phenological development of vine grapes. \nThe USDM timeseries\
    \ over the state of California and over \nSacramento County where the two sites\
    \ are located are also \nshown in Fig. 13 (bottom row), reflecting ambient moisture\
    \ \nconditions.\nFor the two vineyard sites (SLM001 and SLM002), \nthe modeled\
    \ fRET time series from Landsat + ECOS-\nTRESS +  VIIRSI/S2 fusion agree well\
    \ with the tower meas-\nurements (Fig. 12), suggesting that remote sensing can\
    \ effec-\ntively supplement in situ observations used to track stress \nand inform\
    \ vineyard irrigation. We note some negative bias \nin modeled fRET in the second\
    \ half of 2020 as the vines in \nboth blocks start to regrow after grafting (see\
    \ the LAI time-\nseries). Lower actual ET observed in these blocks in 2020 is\
    \ \ndue in large part to reduced biomass post-grafting, but may \nhave been exacerbated\
    \ by severe ambient drought conditions \nas reported in the USDM for Sacramento\
    \ County (Fig. 13). \nThe influence of both management practices and drought \n\
    conditions is reflected in the modeled fRET during the grow-\ning season, approximately\
    \ 0.6–0.7 for 2020 and 0.8–1.0 \n(close to target level) for 2018–2019.\nMaps\
    \ of water use and stress over this three-year inter-\nval (Figs. 14, 15, 16)\
    \ give spatial context for the temporal \nbehavior described in Fig. 13. Figure 14\
    \ shows the monthly \nET over a 3 × 3  km2 area surrounding the SLM001 and \n\
    SLM002 vineyard site. The seasonal trends in water use are \nrelatively consistent\
    \ between 2018 and 2019: ET increases in \nthe irrigated vineyards starting in\
    \ the bud break and flower-\ning stages in May, reaches peak values in June and\
    \ July when \nthe vines and fruit are growing rapidly, declines gradually \nafter\
    \ August in the veraison and post-veraison stage, then \ndrops rapidly after harvest\
    \ in early September with very lit-\ntle evaporation occurring in October (Kustas\
    \ et al. 2018). In \n2020, most blocks show a similar pattern to 2018–2019 but\
    \ \nrelatively lower ET values perhaps related to the drought. \nThe reduced ET\
    \ in the SLM blocks due to the grafting is \nreadily apparent in 2020.\nIn comparison\
    \ with actual ET, fRET is a better indicator \nof water stress since it reduces\
    \ the dependence on seasonal \natmospheric variations and radiation load and more\
    \ focuses \non variations in surface moisture conditions and plant status. \n\
    Spatiotemporal patterns of monthly fRET at 30-m resolution \n(Fig. 15) also reflect\
    \ the impact of management practices. \nIn contrast to 2018–2019, for 2020 fRET\
    \ in the two vineyard \nblocks remains below approximately 0.5 before August,\
    \ \nreflecting the lower biomass and transpiration flux after \ngrafting. Higher\
    \ overall levels of fRET in 2019 in April–July \ncompared to 2018 and 2020 may\
    \ be related to drought relief \nin that year.\nThese temporal differences in\
    \ moisture and plant status \nare highlighted in monthly fRET anomaly (ΔfRET)\
    \ maps com-\nputed relative to the 3-year monthly means (Fig. 16). From \nApril\
    \ to August in 2020, the reduced water use in the grafted \nSLM blocks is clearly\
    \ indicated by significant negative \nanomalies. Negative anomalies were also\
    \ found in surround-\ning fields in 2020, indicating water stress likely related\
    \ to the \nregional drought conditions. In addition to crop management \npractices,\
    \ ΔfRET also represents changes associated with land \ncover/ land use. For example,\
    \ the negative anomalies in the \nalfalfa field south of the SLM002 vineyard in\
    \ June and July \n2018 change to positive in 2019 when a major land cover \nchange\
    \ is from alfalfa to winter wheat. Drier than normal \nconditions in the south-west\
    \ corner in most period of 2018 \ngrowing season also becomes positive in 2019–2020\
    \ as the \ndominate crop type changes from winter wheat to alfalfa.\nIn summary,\
    \ spatial maps of monthly ET, fRET and ΔfRET \nat 30-m scale can help to monitor\
    \ changes in local and \nregional water use, crop management practices and land\
    \ \nuse, providing valuable spatial and temporal information for \ndecision makers\
    \ to assess conditions and develop short- and \nlong-term management strategies.\n\

    \ have demonstrated the added value of extra temporal \nsamples from ECOSTRESS\
    \ and  VIIRSI/S2 for improved \nreconstruction of ET temporal dynamics over irrigated\
    \ and \nintensively managed landscapes, confirming the applicabil-\nity of the\
    \ proposed multi-source fusion. However, the rela-\ntively low spatial contrast\
    \ found in some VIIRS native and \nsharpened LST images might impact the accuracy\
    \ of  VIIRSI/\nS2 ET retrievals (Bellvert et al. 2020; Guzinski and Nieto \n2019;\
    \ Xue et al. 2021). Future studies targeting improved \nregression tree algorithms\
    \ used in DMS may consider add-\ning other bands (e.g., red-edge bands of S2)\
    \ or incorporating \nmicrowave SAR data. The temporal discrepancy between \nHLS\
    \ SR and ECOSTRESS LST data is also a challenge \nbecause inconsistencies between\
    \ these inputs may impact \nboth LST sharpening and ET retrievals (Anderson et al.\
    \ \n2021; Hoffmann et al. 2016), especially over landscapes \nwith rapidly changing\
    \ phenology or moisture status. Future \nstudies targeting daily SR data based\
    \ on fusion approach \nmay effectively reduce temporal discrepancies and therefore\
    \ \nimprove ECOSTRESS ET estimates. In addition, differences \nin pixel footprints\
    \ from different sensors at varying view \nangles can also affect LST sharpening,\
    \ ET disaggregation, \ndata fusion and the consistency of ET time series at fine\
    \ \nspatial resolution. This is a challenging issue for all multi-\nsensor data\
    \ fusion and applications, especially at field to \nsub-field scales.\nAlthough\
    \ multi-source data fusion can partially com-\npensate for the current lack of\
    \ satellite TIR data with the \nrequired resolution, additional direct high-resolution\
    \ TIR \nobservations to complement the existing capabilities of \ncurrent satellites\
    \ are still desirable. A few on-going and \nfuture satellite missions with TIR\
    \ sensors at sub-field reso-\nlution, including the Surface Biology and Geology\
    \ (SBG; \nCawse-Nicholson et al. 2021), Land Surface Temperature \nMonitoring\

    \ bands on Senti-\nnel-2 that have a 5-day return interval and potential to con-\n\
    tribute to increased frequency of daily ET (D’Urso et al. \n2021). Consistency\
    \ and compatibility of ET retrievals from \ndifferent data sources are important\

    \ \nassess the proposed framework over diverse sites sampling \na broader range\

    \ States where there \nis even stronger demand for extra sampling to complement\
    \ \nLandsat (Sun et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2018). These sites may \nshow a more\
    \ marked statistical improvement in ET time-\nseries retrieval with multi-source\
    \ fusion.\nWith several new and proposed medium-resolution \nthermal imaging missions\
    \ on the horizon, the question of \nsufficient collective revisit frequency for\
    \ applications includ-\ning agricultural water management must be addressed. Pre-\n\
    vious studies suggested that revisit period of four (Anderson \net al. 2012; Guillevic\
    \ et al. 2019) or five (Alfieri et al. 2017; \nMercury et al. 2012) days would\

    \ multi-source \nCalifornia ET retrievals developed in this study as a base-\n\
    line, we conducted a similar test on the revisit frequency \nimpact on the accuracy\
    \ of the fused daily ET.\nWe started with a 4-day time interval, and randomly\

    \ interpolated \nusing 500-m  VIIRSM ET as a scaling flux to produce daily \n\
    ET timeseries. In this exercise, we used linear interpolation \nrather than STARFM\
    \ fusion for computational efficiency, \ninterpolating the ratio of 30-m ET to\
    \ 500-m  VIIRSM ET \nbetween selected overpasses and then multiplying by daily\
    \ \n500-m to synthesize a daily 30-m timeseries. To ensure \nrobust results, we\
    \ computed average RMSE with respect to \nobservations from six randomly generated\
    \ timeseries. Then \nwe repeated this process assuming 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day\
    \ \nintervals between overpasses.\nThis experiment was conducted over the RIP760\
    \ site \nfor 2020 (Fig. 17). It can be clearly seen that the RMSE \nincreases\
    \ with respect to the revisit frequency. The results \nare consistent with Guillevic\
    \ et al. (2019) who found that \na four-day revisit provides a significant improvement\
    \ over \na 16-day revisit for ET monitoring and that the ability to \ncapture\
    \ rapid changes in ET was significantly reduced for \nrevisit frequency lower\
    \ than eight days. As pointed out by \nLagouarde et al. (2013), only a one-day\
    \ return interval can \nprovide one cloud-free observation every five days on\
    \ aver-\nage in Europe. Overall, satellite TIR observations with high \nspatiotemporal\
    \ resolution are highly desired in many agri-\ncultural applications.\nConclusion\n\
    In this study, we evaluated the capability of combining \nmulti-source remote\
    \ sensing data for mapping daily ET \nat 30-m resolution over six flux tower sites\
    \ in the Central \nValley of California and Northern Coast for 2018–2020 \nto\
    \ investigate the utility for informing agricultural water \nmanagement practices\
    \ and detecting crop stress. We first \ncompared the performance of 500-m daily\
    \ ET timeseries \ngenerated using  VIIRSM and MODIS LST and SR inputs, \nand found\
    \ comparable or improved accuracy, suggest-\ning that  VIIRSM can effectively\
    \ replace MODIS as the \nfusion backbone of the multi-source ET modeling system\
    \ \nas MODIS approaches end of life. The utility of ECOS-\nTRESS and VIIRS I-5\
    \ band LST data together with the \nHLS SR dataset in generating 30-m ET was explored\
    \ and \nthe results demonstrated that these sources provide com-\nparable accuracy\
    \ to Landsat ET based on both qualitative \nand quantitative measures, in comparison\
    \ with flux tower \nmeasurements.\nWith additional temporal sampling from DisALEXI-\n\
    ECOSTRESS and DisALEXI-VIIRSI/S2, the daily 30-m ET \nestimates obtained from\
    \ Landsat + ECOSTRESS +  VIIRSI/\nS2 fusion generally outperformed the Landsat-only\
    \ fusion \nfor most of the sites, especially over an alfalfa site that exhib-\n\
    its significant temporal variability in ET over the growing \nseason. Fused timeseries\
    \ based on the three thermal data \nsources combined better captured temporal\
    \ dynamics in ET \nover multiple growing seasons in comparison with Landsat-\n\
    only fusion. The added value from extra sampling becomes \nlarger in real-time\
    \ applications, which could be further \namplified when the data latency is considered.\n\
    We also demonstrated the utility of multi-source fused \ndaily ET timeseries for\
    \ remotely detecting water stress sig-\nnals used to manage regulated deficit\
    \ irrigation in vineyards. \nAnomalous water use in two vineyard blocks in 2020\
    \ relative \nto 2018–2019 due to changes in vine management practices \nas well\
    \ as drought is well represented by the fused monthly \nET and fRET anomalies.\
    \ The changes in moisture conditions \nassociated with land cover changes over\
    \ surrounding fields \nwere also revealed by the fRET products. Improved detection\
    \ \nof anomalous water use and stress could help the managers \nto adapt irrigation\
    \ applications in real time and therefore \nimprove the quality and yield in grape\
    \ production.\nAcknowledgements Funding and logistical support for the \nGRAPEX\

    INTRODUCTION\nPrecision \nagriculture \ncurrently \nplays \na significant role\
    \ in the spatial and temporal \nmanagement of the inputs involved in agricultural\
    \ \nproduction. This science focused on the optimization \nof water resources\
    \ in irrigated areas is called \nprecision irrigation (PI), whose objective is\
    \ to \ndevelop appropriate technologies to increase water \nproductivity in irrigated\
    \ agriculture through the \napplication of water in precise and accurate amounts\
    \ \nat the right time, according to the spatial and temporal \nvariability of\
    \ the irrigated areas (ABIOYE et al., \n2020; BWAMBALE et al., 2023; ABAGALE &\
    \ \nANORNU, 2023; CAPRARO et al., 2018).\nIn \naddition, \nconsidering \nirrigation\
    \ \nmanagement, this is elaborated, according to soil, \nplant and climate information,\
    \ which generate a large \nvolume of data to be transformed into prescription\
    \ \nmaps of irrigation depths, based on the variability \nof soil attributes,\
    \ landscape features and growing \nconditions (STONE et al., 2015).\nIn view of\
    \ this, precision irrigation has \ntools capable of identifying contrasting spatial\
    \ \ndifferences in an agricultural production area and \nestablishing personalized\
    \ management in a rational \nway in the field (CASANOVA et al., 2014; CORWIN,\
    \ \n2013; PAN et al., 2013).\nThe technologies being used, including \nin an integrated\
    \ way, are as follows: automatic \n1Programa de Pós-graduação em Engenharia de\

    RESUMO: Nas últimas décadas pesquisas voltadas à irrigação de precisão, impulsionadas\
    \ pelas mudanças climáticas, desenvolveram uma \ninfinidade de estratégias, métodos\
    \ e tecnologias para reduzir o consumo de água em projetos de irrigação, para\
    \ adaptação à crescente ocorrência \nde escassez de água, secas agrícolas e competição\
    \ entre os setores agrícolas e industriais pelo uso da água. Nesta conjuntura,\
    \ a adoção de \npráticas de economia e aplicação de água, implica em uma abordagem\

    Soil moisture sensors in agriculture\nIrrigation management via soil moisture\
    \ \nsensors has recently undergone several commercial \ninnovations, many of which\
    \ have been introduced \nby technology companies and independent research \ngroups\
    \ around the world (FERRAREZI et al., 2020). \nMany of these innovations are due\
    \ to a significant \ndecrease in the prices of monitoring equipment and \ndata\
    \ storage in digital agriculture. TIGLAO et al. \n(2020), who used a system of\
    \ wireless sensors that cost \nhalf the price of commercial systems, achieved\
    \ savings \nof 81% in water consumption applied in irrigation \nmanagement.\n\
    Although, the accessibility of sensors \nhas increased in recent years, their\
    \ operation still \nhas the same fundamentals based on physical, \nchemical \n\
    and \nmechanical \nmethods \nfor \nthe \ndetermination of information of interest,\
    \ which \ncan be obtained electrically, electromagnetically, \noptically, radiometrically,\
    \ mechanically, acoustically, \npneumatically or electrochemically, with the methods\
    \ \nof electrical resistance (Boyoucus), tensiometry, \nneutron moderation and\
    \ time domain reflectometry \n(TDR) being the most used to estimate the amount\
    \ of \nwater available in the soil (ZINKERNAGEL et al., \n2020).\nThe most common\
    \ and simple sensors that \nuse indirect (non-destructive) methods to measure\
    \ \nsoil moisture are resistive sensors that work by \nmonitoring the variation\
    \ in electrical resistance \nbetween two electrodes embedded in the soil. \nAdvantages\
    \ of their use include low acquisition cost, \nsimple sensor operation and easy\
    \ availability in the \nmarket; as a disadvantage, they do not have high \naccuracy\
    \ in soil moisture readings. Models such as \nFC-28 and SEN0114 are found on the\
    \ market. The \nother sensors are capacitive, such as the SHT10 \nand EC-5 models;\
    \ they work by measuring the \ndielectric constant of the soil by the time elapsed\
    \ \nafter emitting an electromagnetic pulse generated by \nmetal rods embedded\
    \ in the soil. These sensors have \nthe advantage of high accuracy in readings;\
    \ however, \ndue to the construction of their sophisticated and \nexpensive electronic\
    \ components, their acquisition \ncosts can be high (GASCH et al., 2017; GOMES\
    \ \net al., 2017; MATOS et al., 2017). Other models \nfound on the market include\
    \ Decagon 10HS, Meter \nTEROS-12 (also measures temperature and electrical \n\
    conductivity), Sentek Drill & Drop (measuring \nmoisture, temperature and salinity\
    \ every 10 cm) and \nWatermark 200SS (measures the tension of water \nheld in\
    \ the soil in kPa).\nDue to the wide variety of methods for \nobtaining data and\
    \ the very nature of construction of \nhumidity sensors, a series of usage characteristics\
    \ and \nrecommendations for each field condition can be specified \nin each specific\
    \ situation ZINKERNAGEL et al. (2020).\nOne of the biggest advantages of using\
    \ soil \nmoisture sensors is linked to irrigation management, \nsince monitoring\
    \ the amount of water in the soil is a \ndirect indication of the irrigation needs\
    \ of an agricultural \narea (HAMAMI & NASSEREDDINE, 2020).This \napplicability\
    \ can be observed in research carried out by \nO’SHAUGHNESSY et al. (2020) in\
    \ the state of Texas, \nUSA, studying the productivity of Sorgum bicolor L., in\
    \ \nwhich the productivity of irrigation water was quantified \nbased on three\
    \ different management methodologies, \nvia plant-based thermal patterns, via\
    \ soil-based \nneutron probe measurements, and a hybrid method \ncombining plant\
    \ and soil monitoring over a period \nof three consecutive years. The researchers\
    \ reported \nthat in the periods of joint use of monitoring methods \n(hybrid\
    \ method), there was a consistent increase in the \naccumulation of biomass, resulting\
    \ in both productivity \ngains per unit of area and water savings.\nEL-NAGGAR\
    \ et al. (2020), in an \nexperiment in New Zealand with bean and pea crops \n\
    under two irrigation management methods, via \nclimatological water balance and\
    \ via capacitive soil \nmoisture sensors (FDR) coupled with radiofrequency \n\
    data transmission systems (IoT), observed a difference \nin the volume of water\
    \ applied and at the beginning \nof irrigation operations, resulting in savings\
    \ between \n27–44% of the volume of water used in areas managed \nwith soil moisture\
    \ sensors. This result was attributed \nto the imprecision of the balance methodology\
    \ of \nwater in predicting the effects of poor soil drainage, \nPrecision irrigation\
    \ trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n3\nespecially\
    \ resulting from the presence of a physical \nimpediment in the soil profile,\
    \ which underestimates \nthe real volume of water available to the plants.\nIn\
    \ addition to monitoring, the use of \nsensors also encompasses the use of automation\
    \ in \nirrigation systems, as can be seen in a study carried \nout by CONESA et\
    \ al. (2021), where the use of an \nautomatic irrigation system based on capacitance\
    \ \nsensors (FDR) showed better results in the efficiency \nof water use, resulting\
    \ in a decrease in the irrigation \ndepth compared to methods based on monitoring\
    \ the \nevapotranspiration of the water reference (ETo) and \nin the use of crop\
    \ coefficients (Kc) in the literature. \nJAISWAL & BALLAL (2020) used an automatic\
    \ \nsystem based on soil and climate sensors operating \nwith fuzzy logic to control\
    \ the flow of the irrigation \nsystem, achieving a smaller volume of water between\
    \ \n45% and 30%, respectively, as well as lower irrigation \ncosts, when compared\
    \ to the flood irrigation system.\nAccording to DOMÍNGUEZ-NIÑO et al. \n(2020),\
    \ the use of sensors in agriculture also allows a \nbetter understanding of the\
    \ real situation of humidity \nin different areas with plants in different stages\
    \ of \ngrowth, since monitoring via sensors takes place \ndirectly at the place\
    \ of interest and not in a generalized \nway, such as in climate monitoring, which\
    \ often \nconsiders irrigation sites based on a single stage of \nplant growth.\n\
    The automation of irrigation systems \nbased on soil sensors associated with the\
    \ use of IoT \ntechnologies can be observed in the research of \nBARKUNAN et al.\
    \ (2019) in which the soil moisture \nand climate monitoring sensors were connected\
    \ \nthrough a microcontroller capable of sending messages \nto the operator’s\
    \ smartphone, providing information \non the soil moisture conditions and the\
    \ beginning of \nthe irrigation period. This is possible through the use \nof\
    \ wireless communication devices that allow data \ntransfer between applications\
    \ without cables.\nThe use of a wireless sensor network \nis very important in\
    \ precision irrigation because, \naccording to irrigation management, extension\
    \ of \nthe area to be irrigated and producer preferences, it \nis necessary to\
    \ use spatially distributed sensor mesh \nto attend to data collection remotely\
    \ from several \nirrigated sectors, for example. Cabe points out that \nthe choice\
    \ of type of wireless device must consider the \nrange of the device. For example,\
    \ a Bluetooth device, \nmodel HC-06, with an SPP usage profile (Serial Port \n\
    Profile), has a maximum distance of 10 m between \nconnected devices, with a point-to-point\
    \ connection. \nAnother model, the XBee XB24-Z7WIT-004, of \nZigBee specification,\
    \ uses radiofrequency signals \nfor communication and low operating power, with\
    \ a \nrange limit of about 100 m, which allows point-to-\npoint and multipoint\
    \ connections, making it possible \nto form a mesh network of wireless devices.\n\
    Challenges in the application of sensors for soil \nmoisture monitoring\nOne of\
    \ the challenges for using FDR \nor TDR sensors in soil water monitoring is the\
    \ \nrelationship between factory calibration and sensor \ninstallation orientation\
    \ in the soil profile (vertical or \nhorizontal), which can cause systematic variations\
    \ in \nthe humidity readings.\nThis effect was observed by CHEN et al. \n(2019a),who\
    \ when comparing a capacity sensor and \nthree TDR sensors in three positions\
    \ on the ground, \nobserved a significant variation in the readings of \nwater\
    \ content in the soil under irrigation, concluding \nthat, in general, for sensors\
    \ with factory calibration, \nthe vertical orientation presents greater precision\
    \ when \ncompared to horizontal orientation, attributing this \nphenomenon to\
    \ the greater disruption in the soil that \nthe installation in the horizontal\
    \ position of the sensor \ncauses at the time of installation of the sensor. They\
    \ \nsuggested that irrigators should follow the positioning \nthat manufacturers\
    \ recommend for their equipment.\nHowever, SHARMA et al. (2017) pointed \nout\
    \ that, not infrequently, the calibration of sensors \nprovided by manufacturers\
    \ can overestimate the \nvolume of water in the soil and that, although they may\
    \ \nbe suitable for soils of similar texture, they often do \nnot consider factors\
    \ such as type, amount of organic \nmatter and apparent density of the soil, which\
    \ influence \nthe dielectric properties, making a local calibration \nnecessary\
    \ for better accuracy in the readings.\nFor the positioning of sensors in soil\
    \ \nlayers of different textures, KARGAS & SOULIS \n(2019) observed interesting\
    \ results, concluding \nthat for the correct management of irrigation in \nproductive\
    \ areas, it is necessary to use a different \nsensor for each soil layer or a\
    \ single sensor installed \nin the middle portion of the root system that is in\
    \ \ncontact with both layers simultaneously.\nSILVA et al. (2018), in a study\
    \ on banana, \nobserved that the ideal positioning of the sensors may \nnot be\
    \ constant throughout the development of the \nplant; that is, the most representative\
    \ position for the \nsensor to read the soil moisture may vary along with \nthe\
    \ phenological stage of the plant.\nOther factors such as salinity, soil textural\
    \ \nclass and temperature where the sensor is installed can \nalso affect the\
    \ accuracy of soil moisture monitoring, \nwhich may limit the use of these sensors\
    \ in areas \n4\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nwith higher temperatures,\
    \ such as semi-arid and \narid regions, or the use of reused water in irrigation\
    \ \n(CARDENAS-LAILHACAR & DUKES, 2015; \nINCROCCI et al., 2019; OATES et al.,\
    \ 2017).\nNaturally, the use of soil moisture sensors \nin agriculture results\
    \ in a large amount of data for \nanalysis. It is possible to observe a growing\
    \ trend \nin researches that use data science techniques to \ninterpret the readings\
    \ of these sensors based on \nartificial intelligence techniques.\nResearches\
    \ \nsuch \nas \nthe \none \nby \nGOLDSTEIN et al. (2017) trained several machine\
    \ \nlearning algorithms in the interpretation of a series \nof climatic and soil\
    \ data to propose assertive \nrecommendations for the management of irrigation\
    \ in \nthe field based on data storage in cloud computing.\nUsing more robust\
    \ computational techniques, \nsuch as “neural networks” it is possible to employ\
    \ a \nnetwork of sensors for the precise determination of \nsoil moisture, resulting\
    \ not only in more homogeneous \nirrigation in the areas but also in water and\
    \ electrical \nenergy savings through the best use of the pumping \nsystem (DURSUN\
    \ & ÖZDEN, 2016).\nThe use of mobile sensor systems, together \nwith graphical\
    \ software, to better understand the \ndetermination and monitoring of soil moisture\
    \ \ndistribution; although, in smaller quantities, also \nexpands the options\
    \ for new research areas and future \napplications at the field level (SHAN et\
    \ al., 2019).\nFinally, the development of the following \nnew \ntypes \nof \n\
    sensors \ndemonstrate \nindustrial \ninnovations to be used in future research:\
    \ mm-sized \nsoil moisture sensors (ZHOU et al., 2019), which \nhave the ability\
    \ to perform better monitoring of water \ndistribution in the soil profile; perforated\
    \ coaxial \ncylinder (CHEN et al., 2019c), capable of monitoring \nboth soil water\
    \ volume and temperature; thick film \nconductivity sensors (SOPHOCLEOUS et al.,\
    \ 2020), \ncapable of monitoring changes in soil structure through \nchanges in\
    \ conductivity and soil water content; and a \nFiber Bragg Grating sensor (ZHANG\
    \ et al., 2019), \ndeveloped for monitoring water pressure in the field.\nUse\
    \ of satellites and spectral sensors for precision \nirrigation\nAdvances in spectroscopy\
    \ have allowed \nthe execution of specific analyses of different types of \nmaterials\
    \ in a non-destructive and fast way, revealing \nvaluable information through\
    \ the energy reflection of \nthe targets (LILLESAND & KIEFER, 1994).\nSpectral\
    \ sensor technology has been used \nto efficiently generate information on a large\
    \ time–\nspace scale. Data collected in the field with point \nequipment can be,\
    \ in some cases, more accurate, \nwhile cost, speed and practicality are advantages\
    \ \nof spectral sensors coupled to satellites or UAVs to \ncapture information\
    \ spatially distributed over large \nareas. The remote data analyzed allow considerations\
    \ \nabout photosynthesis, physiological disturbances, \nphenology and water interactions\
    \ in real time, which \nare fundamental for water planning and management \n(KARTHIKEYAN\
    \ et al., 2020).\nSatellites and sensors\nThere are currently several satellites\
    \ in \noperation that perform this type of work remotely: \nMODIS, Landsat 7,\
    \ Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. \nThe great acceptance of this technology is because\
    \ \nthey are free products, with good spatiotemporal \nresolution and radiometric\
    \ quality and with ease of \ndata integration with APIs.\nThe data generated by\
    \ satellites can be useful \nin several applications at the irrigation level.\
    \ VANINO \net al. (2018) combined meteorological data with data \ncaptured by\
    \ the sensors of the Sentinel 2A satellite to \nestimate the leaf area index and\
    \ surface albedo to use \nthis information to calculate the evapotranspiration\
    \ \nof tomato crops and validate it through comparison \nwith evapotranspiration\
    \ data obtained by the soil–\nwater balance. The results of this research showed\
    \ the \nsatisfactory suitability of the Sentinel 2A satellite to \ndetermine water\
    \ demand. SHADMAN et al. (2017) \nused thermal band data from the Landsat 8 satellite\
    \ \nto estimate water stress in sugarcane plants through \nthe crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI). According to the \nauthor, the data capacity of the satellite\
    \ sensors was \npositive and sufficient to carry out monitoring via \nremote sensing\
    \ of the water stress of sugarcane without \nthe need for auxiliary soil data.\n\
    MARINO et al. (2014) evaluated spectral \ndifferences in tomato leaves located\
    \ in 3 irrigated \nregions, classifying them as high (H), medium (M) \nand low\
    \ (L) in terms of water use and efficiency; \nNETO et al. (2017) evaluated the\
    \ spectral reflectance \nin the visible (VIS) and near-infrared region (NIR) \n\
    of sunflower leaves in water deficit to obtain \nmodels capable of estimating\
    \ the status of water \nand chlorophyll. CHEMURA et al. (2017) used \ninformation\
    \ from VIS and NIR to create a machine \nlearning model using the random forest\
    \ algorithm \nto predict the water content in the plant in the coffee \ncrop.\
    \ All studies were conclusive and showed \nvariations in spectral identity in\
    \ relation to variations \nin water content in plants.\nIn precision irrigation,\
    \ indices generated \nfrom orbital satellites have been mainly used to: \nPrecision\

    5\n(a) monitor irrigation systems in macro-regions; (b) \nadapt local crop coefficients\
    \ for a better calculation of \nplant evapotranspiration; and (c) estimate vegetative\
    \ \nmetrics such as plant density, coverage fraction (fc) \nand leaf area index\
    \ (FRENCH et al., 2020).\nAccording to CHEN et al. (2018), many \nstudies focus\
    \ only on mapping the extent of irrigated \nareas without considering important\
    \ information \nthat could also be extracted with the use of remote \nsensing,\
    \ such as the amount of water with drawn from \nthe system and the frequency and\
    \ time of irrigation.\nDifferent levels of decision can be used in \nirrigated\
    \ macro-regions using satellite systems, since \nit is possible to track the temporal\
    \ growth of crops, \nderiving this information in basal coefficients that \nallow\
    \ a better estimate of regional evapotranspiration. \nThus, GONZÁLEZ-DUGO et al.\
    \ (2013) developed a \nmethodology called MINARET (monitoring irrigated \nagriculture\
    \ ET), which uses Landsat data capable \nof constantly monitoring the water consumption\
    \ of \ndifferent irrigated crops. MASELLI et al. (2020) used \nmeteorological\
    \ data together with Sentinel 2A data to \nestimate evapotranspiration in monitoring\
    \ irrigated \nareas in the Italian semi-arid region.\nObtaining evapotranspiration\
    \ values with \ngreater precision is a fundamental factor, as it is a key \nparameter\
    \ in the water and energy balance equation. \nFAO bulletin 56 states that crop\
    \ evapotranspiration \n(ETc) can be calculated by multiplying the reference \n\
    evapotranspiration (ETo) and a specific crop \ncoefficient (Kc) (ALLEN et al.,\
    \ 1998).\nAlthough, \nthe \ncoefficients \nprovided \nby the FAO are general,\
    \ throughout the growing \nseason, there are variations in crop characteristics,\
    \ \nso the parameter is intrinsically linked to species, \nvariety, plant population\
    \ density, phenology, water \navailability, climate and other factors. Therefore,\
    \ a \nstandard Kc may not well represent some localities, \ncausing less reliable\
    \ estimates and directly impacting \ngood water use (MOKHTARIA et al., 2018).\
    \ In \nrecent years, several works have contributed to more \naccurate irrigation,\
    \ developing methods to estimate \nKc or Kcb (basal crop coefficient) and considering\
    \ \nvegetation indices, which are considered great \nphenological thermometers,\
    \ called Kc-VI (ALAM et \nal., 2018; CAMPOS et al., 2017). Still, more recently,\
    \ \nPEREIRA et al. (2021) published a newsletter \n(Updates and forward to the\
    \ FAO56 crop water \nrequirements method - Case studies using ground \nand remote\
    \ sensing data; applications to update and \nupgrade the FAO56 method) with updates\
    \ of these \ncoefficients through a collection of several studies, \nwith the\
    \ use of new tools, such as remote sensing and \nIoT, which bring more precision\
    \ to the calculation \nof the water needs of crops, which are important \nadvances\
    \ for precision irrigation.\nFRENCH et al. (2020), using data from \nLandsat and\
    \ Sentinel mission satellites, determined \na Kc-VI used to calculate wheat evapotranspiration.\
    \ \nThe experiment was carried out in the American \nsouthwest, and it was concluded\
    \ that the best values \nof Kc and ETc were obtained in the middle of the \nseason\
    \ until the end of senescence, while at a time \npoint sooner than 60 days after\
    \ planting, a high and \noverestimated ETc was observed due to the low \ncoverage\
    \ canopy at the time, which contributed to the \nlow reflectivity of the plants.\n\
    Electromagnetic \napproach \napplied \nto \nthe \ndetermination of the spatial\
    \ variability of the water \nstatus of plants in the field based on UAVs\nFour\
    \ components must be considered \nbefore selecting the appropriate UAV for IP\
    \ (GAGO \net al., 2015): experimental design, type of data to be \nobtained, data\
    \ acquisition, and data processing and \nresults. In addition to UAVs, sensors\
    \ are essential for \nthe quality of the images obtained. Decision-making \nregarding\
    \ the type of camera to be used depends \ndirectly on the project objective. The\
    \ cameras \nembedded in UAVs most used in the IP concept \naiming intelligent\
    \ management of water are thermal, \nmultispectral, hyperspectral, RGB and near\
    \ infrared \n(NIR) cameras.\nTo monitor biotic and abiotic stress, \nthermal (1\
    \ band) and hyperspectral (100–250 bands) \ncameras are recommended, while multispectral\
    \ (6–12 \nbands) and RGB cameras (3 bands) are indicated for \ngrowth and biomass\
    \ assessment (ADÃO et al., 2017). \nHigh-resolution RGB cameras are traditionally\
    \ used \nin agroforestry applications; however, they lack the \nprecision and\
    \ spectral range to trace the material \ncharacteristics that hyperspectral and\
    \ multispectral \ncameras can provide.\nSUSIČ et al. (2018) demonstrated the \n\
    potential of using hyperspectral images ranging from \n400 to 2500 nm to assess\
    \ the water deficit status in tomato \nplants. ZARCO-TEJADA et al. (2012) used\
    \ UAV-based \nhyperspectral and thermal cameras to assess water stress \nlevels\
    \ in citrus crops and confirmed a link between PRI \nand canopy temperature. Recently,\
    \ LOGGENBERG \net al. (2018) used hyperspectral technology combined \nwith machine\
    \ learning to discriminate between water-\nstressed and non-stressed vines.\n\
    Hyperspectral imaging cameras generally \ncapture more detail in spatial and spectral\
    \ ranges \ncompared to other cameras. LOGGENBERG et al. \n6\nCiência Rural, v.53,\
    \ n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\n(2018) observed that the main limiting factor in\
    \ the \napplication of hyperspectral data is the inherent issue \nof dimensionality,\
    \ which results in reduced precision. \nIn addition, hyperspectral cameras are\
    \ very expensive \nand complex (ELVANIDI et al., 2018), which limits \ntheir expeditious\
    \ and wide application, especially in \ncommercial agriculture.\nMultispectral\
    \ cameras are composed \nof multiple sensors with high-quality filters that \n\
    can simultaneously capture images using different \nwave frequencies. They can\
    \ record both the light \nspectrum that is visible to the human eye and the \n\
    non-visible spectrum; thus, these cameras allow for \nmuch more accurate measurements\
    \ of plant health \nand phenological status than conventional cameras \n(RGB)\
    \ (KHANAL et al., 2017).\nMultispectral and hyperspectral cameras \ndo not have\
    \ a resolution comparable to traditional \nRGB cameras, which causes some initial\
    \ frustration \nfor users new to the spectral area accustomed to \ntraditional\
    \ high-resolution images. The resolution of \nRGB cameras is in the range of 20–120\
    \ MB, while \nmultispectral and hyperspectral cameras have a \nresolution between\
    \ 0.2–3 MB.\nAccording to POBLETE et al. (2017), \nplant water status is not accurately\
    \ predicted using \nmultispectral imaging between the 500 and 800 nm \nspectral\
    \ bands due to the lack of sensitivity to water \ncontent; however, wavelengths\
    \ greater than 800 nm \nare best for this purpose.\nRALLO et al. (2014) observed\
    \ that \nsatisfactory estimation of leaf water potential at leaf \nand canopy\
    \ levels can be obtained using vegetation \nindices based on the NIR shortwave\
    \ infrared domain, \nwith specific optimization of the “central bands.”\nRecently,\
    \ some researchers have developed \nartificial neural network (ANN) models derived\
    \ from \nmultispectral images to predict the spatial variability \nof water potential\
    \ in agricultural crops. ROMERO et \nal. (2018) classified the water status of\
    \ the vine based \non 10 vegetation indices (VI) using bands of Red, \nGreen,\
    \ Red-Edge, and NIR wavelengths and found \nthat there were no significant relationships\
    \ between \nindividual VIs, with values of correlation lower than \n0.3 for almost\
    \ all the studied indices.\nThere is a very specific spectral band \ncalled RedEdge,\
    \ which lies between red and \ninfrared, has excellent correlation with chlorophyll\
    \ \nfluorescence and effectively differentiates between \nhealthy and senescent\
    \ vegetation (MATESE & DI \nGENNARO, 2018). There is already a range of \nspecific\
    \ multispectral cameras for use embedded in \nUAVs (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018).\
    \ Among \nthem, Tetracam, Airinov and Micasense camera \nmanufacturers can be\
    \ highlighted.\nTetracam’s modular cameras can be \nmounted in different arrangements,\
    \ depending \non which bands you want to capture and which \nbandwidths. Airinov’sagro\
    \ Sensor has 4 bands and \nhas been used by the famous eBee AG, the version of\
    \ \nthe fixed-wing UAV for agricultural applications in \nSwitzerland Sensefly\
    \ (MATESE & DI GENNARO, \n2018). The American Micasense manufactures \nthe RedEdge\
    \ sensor, a multispectral camera that \nsimultaneously captures 5 different narrow-width\
    \ \nbands and a more recent dual camera that captures 10 \nspectral bands. In\
    \ addition to the RGB bands of the \nvisible spectrum, the camera also captures\
    \ the NIR in \nthe non-visible spectrum and the RedEdge, a spectral \nband that\
    \ is positioned exactly on the threshold \nbetween the visible and the non-visible.\
    \ In addition to \nincreasing the sensitivity of certain indices, it is with \n\
    this spectral band that certain diseases and crop pests \ncan be identified (DEVIA\
    \ et al., 2019).\nDEVIA et al. (2019) studied biomass \nproduction in rice crops\
    \ using multispectral imaging. \nThe authors presented a method for biomass \n\
    estimation using near-infrared (NIR) images captured \nat different crop scales.\
    \ The approach estimated the \nbiomass of large areas of the crop with an average\
    \ \ncorrelation of 0.76 in relation to the traditional manual \ndestructive method.\n\
    KITIĆ et al. (2019) proposed a low-\ncost portable active multispectral optical\
    \ device \nfor accurate detection of plant stress and to \nperform field mapping\
    \ called Plant-O-Meter. The \ndevice has an integrated multispectral source \n\
    that comprises light in four more indicative \nwavelengths (850, 630, 535 and\
    \ 465 nm) and allows \nthe simultaneous illumination of the entire plant. \nSequential\
    \ illumination and detection provide fast \nreflectance measurements, which are\
    \ transmitted \nby wireless to Android-powered devices for data \nprocessing and\
    \ storage. The device was tested under \nlaboratory conditions by comparing Plant-O-Meter\
    \ \nmeasurements with imaging results from a SPECIM \nhyperspectral camera and\
    \ a GreenSeeker handheld \ndevice under field conditions. The comparison \nrevealed\
    \ comparable performance, showing a strong \ncorrelation in both the hyperspectral\
    \ (R2 = 0.997) \nand portable GreenSeeker (R2 = 0.954) from the \nlaboratory measurements\
    \ and R2 = 0.886 for the field \nexperiments), indicating that the device exhibited\
    \ \nstrong potential for accurate stress measurements.\nThe scientific articles\

    \ cameras used by the \nscientific community for the rapid detection of water\
    \ \nstress in culture.\nArtificial intelligence in precision agriculture\nDue\
    \ to climatic uncertainties, the growing \ndemand for food and the rapid expansion\
    \ of the \npopulation, the agricultural sector is increasingly \ndependent on\
    \ the use of new technologies to obtain \nhigher yields in a sustainable way with\
    \ each harvest. In \nthis context, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly\
    \ \ndeveloping \napplications \nin \nagriculture \naiming \nproductivity gains\
    \ in a precise and effective way, \navoiding the waste of resources (SHAIKH et\
    \ al., 2022).\nIn recent decades, researchers have strived \nto allow computers\
    \ to extract enough information \nfrom raw data to model the real world. To achieve\
    \ \nthis, many have turned to machine learning \nalgorithms to capture a large\
    \ amount of information \nand automatically discover the representations \nneeded\
    \ to detect or classify input patterns and solve \nthe various problems and needs\
    \ of the agricultural \nsector (KHALIL & ABDULLAEV, 2021). Machine \nlearning\
    \ algorithms are computation models with \nparticular properties such as learning,\
    \ generalizing, \ngrouping or organizing data. They consist of \ndistributed structures\
    \ formed by a large number \nof very simplified processing units connected to\
    \ \neach other. Intelligent behavior occurs through the \ninteractions of the\
    \ neural network processing units \n(CANZIANI et al., 2016). The first neural\
    \ networks \nto achieve widespread repercussions were based \non unsupervised\
    \ pre-training. However, it was the \nrediscovery of convolutional neural networks\
    \ (CNN) \n(LECUN et al., 1998) that made this topic one of the \nmain topics in\
    \ machine learning, parallel processing \ntechnologies in GPUs (Graphal Processor\
    \ Unit) and \nlarge databases that allowed these networks to be used \nfully.\
    \ With the good performance being demonstrated \nby such models, other areas of\
    \ knowledge besides \nthe area of computing have been using these models \nfor\
    \ different purposes, as in the area of agricultural \nsciences since the 1990s\
    \ with the pioneering work \nof MCQUEEN et al. (1995), in which the authors \n\
    investigated the use of machine learning techniques \nexisting at the time for\
    \ some problems in agriculture \nand horticulture and presented a case study to\
    \ infer \nmanagement rules for some invasive plants. Recent \nresearch has used\
    \ PCN-type networks (pulse-coupled \nnetworks) for the separation of wheat grains\
    \ and to \nevaluate the physical characteristics of the soil and \nthe growth\
    \ of the cultures, concluding after field \nexperiments that the developed model\
    \ assisted in \nchoosing the crop that best suited the evaluated soil \n(SHAIKH\
    \ et al., 2022).\nWorks that involve not only agronomic data \nbut also other\
    \ technologies, such as satellite images, \nhave been developed, such as the classification\
    \ of \nmanagement areas using satellite images (KHALIL \n& ABDULLAEV, 2021). In\
    \ the context of the use of \nneural networks for agriculture and with the advent\
    \ \nof cheaper computing resources combined with the \nnew sensors that are being\
    \ developed, proposals that \nincreasingly use cutting-edge technological resources\
    \ \nare noted (SOBAYO et al., 2018).\nAs a tool to aid strategic decision making,\
    \ \nsmart agriculture has emerged as a new scientific \narea that employs, among\
    \ other technologies, \nmachine learning algorithms to assess and monitor \nthe\
    \ conditions of growing areas, such as soil and \nweather conditions, leading\
    \ to more accurate results \n(LIAKOS et al., 2018).\nBACHOUR \net \nal. \n(2015)\
    \ \nused \na \nmethodology that combines wavelet mult-iresolution \nanalysis with\
    \ the MVRVM algorithm (multivariate \nrelevance vector machine) to predict 16\
    \ days of \nETo. More recently, deep learning (DL) is a machine \nlearning technique\
    \ that has shown good results in \nsolving agricultural problems. KAMILARIS &\
    \ \nPRENAFETA-BOLDÚ (2018) presented a review \nof 40 relevant studies in the\
    \ area and found that, in \naddition to improvements in the performance of \n\
    classification/prediction problems, DL also reduced \nresource engineering in\
    \ many of the works.\nFor crop management, for example, yield \npredictions can\
    \ be made from satellite images, as \npresented by KHALIL & ABDULLAEV (2021).\
    \ In \nthis research, the authors concluded that it is possible \nto predict wheat\
    \ yield from image processing with \nsupervised Kohonen networks. Another beneficial\
    \ \nactivity is pest and disease control, where the \nspraying of pesticides is\
    \ now directed only to the \naffected plants, reducing financial and environmental\
    \ \ncosts (JIAO et al., 2022).\nIn water and soil management, important \npractices\
    \ have been developed not only to increase crop \nproductivity but also to use\
    \ these resources efficiently. \nPATIL & DEKA (2016) used the extreme learning\
    \ \nalgorithm to estimate the weekly evapotranspiration \nof a crop in India.\
    \ In soil management, GU et al. \n(2021) presented a new method for estimating\
    \ \nsoil moisture based on ANN models. ANN shave \nalso been the subject of scientific\
    \ investigations in \nthe field of irrigation engineering to estimate the \nlocalized\

    \ & ALAZBA (2017), the use of neural \nnetworks presents a powerful tool for estimating\
    \ the \nload loss caused by initial connectors when compared \nto the use of empirical\
    \ models. KADHEM et al. \n(2017) used a neural network to predict wind speed \n\
    data with chronological and seasonal characteristics. \nThe authors concluded\
    \ that the neural network \nwas able to portray variations in wind speed with\
    \ \ngood performance during the different seasons \nof the year. LIU et al. (2018)\
    \ developed a wind \nspeed prediction model based on WPD (wavelet \npacket decomposition),\
    \ CNN (convolutional neural \nnetwork) and CNNLSTM (convolutional long short-\n\
    term memory network). To verify the prediction \nperformance of the proposed model,\
    \ it was compared \nwith 8 neural models widely used by the scientific \ncommunity.\
    \ The authors concluded that the proposed \nmodel is robust and effective in predicting\
    \ wind speed \ntime series.\nDefinition of management zones in precision \nirrigation\n\
    One way to manage physical, chemical \nand/or biological variations within a growing\
    \ area is \nthrough the delineation of management zones (ZM). \nManagement zones\
    \ are sub-areas within a cultivation \narea that have similar characteristics\
    \ but differ to a \ncertain degree from the others in such a way that a \nparticular\
    \ agronomic management is justified to be \nadopted in each of them (KITCHEN et\
    \ al., 2005).\nFor management zones to be determined, \nit is necessary to obtain\
    \ data from the area of \ninterest, which can be of various types, such as crop\
    \ \nproductivity, soil physical and chemical properties, \ntopography, vegetation\
    \ indices, and aerial images. \nFrom these individual or combined data, thematic\
    \ \nmaps are created, and this spatial information is then \ninterpreted. In this\
    \ context, BAZZI et al. (2018) used \nsoil property data to define management\
    \ zones, such as \nsoil texture and apparent electrical conductivity. YAO \net\
    \ al. (2014) used soil physicochemical properties and \ncrop yield data and determined\
    \ management zones.\nGenerally, \nirrigation \nis \ncarried \nout \nuniformly\
    \ in a cultivated area, regardless of the \nspatial characteristics of that area.\
    \ In the field, the \nwater content in the soil is not homogeneous due \nto its\
    \ spatial variability, which ranges from crop \ndevelopment, difference in relief\
    \ and variation of soil \nhydraulic properties and rainfall distribution. Thus,\
    \ \nthe proper use of irrigation in each management zone \nreduces the volume\
    \ of water used in the irrigation \nsystem, as there is an increase in efficiency\
    \ that \nprovides growth in productivity, reducing nutrient \nleaching and water\
    \ waste. Management zones are used \nto optimize irrigated areas, where a heterogeneous\
    \ area \nis separated into homogeneous zones and irrigation \nmanagement will\
    \ be the same in these regions (LIANG \net al., 2016; PEREA et al., 2017).\nFor\
    \ XIANG et al. (2007), cluster analyses \nand empirical analyses are the categories\
    \ in which \nmost of the methods used to define management \nzones are inserted.\
    \ Since the empirical methods are \nsimpler, based on specialized knowledge and\
    \ on the \ndistribution of productivity in the production areas, \nin this way,\
    \ it is possible to divide a heterogeneous \narea into homogeneous sub-areas.\
    \ However, cluster \nanalysis is a more complex, less subjective method \nthat\
    \ uses multiple variables during the establishment \nof management zones. In cluster\
    \ analysis methods, \ndata points in a cropping area are divided into \ndifferent\
    \ classes, where the similarities between the \npoints are evaluated to define\
    \ the classes, and with \nthat, the management zones are defined (GAVIOLI et \n\
    al., 2019; LI et al., 2007).\nTo define management zones, several \nfactors and\
    \ data are often used; in this case, a \nmultivariate analysis was used to define\
    \ the zones. \nOLDONI et al. (2019) also used geostatistical and \nmultivariate\
    \ analyses to determine management \nzones in a peach orchard, with a clustering\
    \ approach \non both soil (soil texture, water content, organic \nmatter content)\
    \ and plant (amount of fruit per tree, \naverage fruit weight, total soluble solute\
    \ content) for \ndifferentiated management.\nAnother form of multivariate geospatial\
    \ \nanalysis is kriging factor analysis, a data interpolation \nmethod that identifies\
    \ variability and was used in \nthe study by BEVINGTON et al. (2019), where soil\
    \ \nproperties and hydraulic parameters were measured \nto define management zones\
    \ using kriging factor \nanalysis and the fuzzy-c means algorithm. CHEN et \n\
    al. (2019b) used an RGB camera attached to a UAV \nto determine the plant cover\
    \ and vigor of the peanut \nand cotton canopy through the green–red vegetation\
    \ \nindex to determine management zones in Italy, used \nas indicators of irrigation\
    \ uniformity, which they also \nserved as an indication for the application of\
    \ variable \nrate irrigation (VRI) in a pivot system. In the research \nby SCHENATTO\
    \ et al. (2017), management zones \nwere also created using the fuzzy-c means\
    \ algorithm, \nfocusing on soil characteristics, such as elevation, \nslope, density,\
    \ organic matter, clay and sand contents, \nand plant attributes, such as yield.\n\
    In the study by ANASTASIOU et al. \n(2019), multivariate geostatistical techniques\
    \ were \nPrecision irrigation trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural,\
    \ v.53, n.8, 2023.\n9\nalso used to unite the multitemporal data from a \nmultiband\
    \ radiometer and a geophysical sensor and \nthus delimit the management zones\
    \ of a vineyard, \nconsidering the electrical conductivity of the soil \nand canopy\
    \ area. OHANA-LEVI et al. (2019) used \na weighted multivariate spatial clustering\
    \ model \nto determine irrigation management zones in a \nvineyard. Management\
    \ zones were determined using \na multivariate k-means cluster, and machine learning\
    \ \nand spatial statistics were also used to analyze the \nvariables, which comprised\
    \ soil properties, terrain \ncharacteristics and environmental impact.\nAnother\
    \ tool used to collect data and define \nmanagement zones is the proximal sensing\
    \ of the \nsoil, based on electromagnetic induction techniques, \nradiometry and\
    \ fluorimetry (CASTANEDO, 2013). \nIn the research by CASTRIGNANÒ et al. (2017),\
    \ \nproximal and remote sensors were used in a tomato \ngrowing area, and there\
    \ was integration with \nmultivariate geostatistical data to define management\
    \ \nzones based on the electrical conductivity of the soil, \nwhich was measured\
    \ at different frequencies, sensor \npolarizations and depths. Likewise, MOUAZEN\
    \ et \nal. (2014) used a soil sensor to measure electrical \nconductivity, soil\
    \ water holding capacity, available \nwater, organic matter, density, clay content\
    \ and \norganic carbon, establishing a multi-sensor and data \nfusion approach\
    \ to delineating management zones for \nsite-specific irrigation, best addressed\
    \ in section 1 of \nthis review.\nTo define management zones, low-cost \nremote\
    \ sensing data are viable options (section 2 of \nthis review), where spatiotemporal\
    \ information on \nthe biological and physical parameters of vegetation \nare\
    \ used (FONTANET et al., 2018). FONTANET et \nal. (2020) used remote sensing to\
    \ define management \nzones in a corn planting area, analyzing normalized \ndifference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI) time series by \nremote sensing, soil moisture sensors,\
    \ and root zone \nsimulation predictions. GOBBO et al. (2019) also \nused NDVI\
    \ in defining management zones in corn \nplantations and combined it with soil\
    \ texture data to \ncreate irrigation management zones.\nIn the research by GEORGI\
    \ et al. (2017), \nremote sensing was used together with an automatic \ndelineation\
    \ algorithm. An automatic segmentation \nalgorithm \nwas \ndeveloped \nusing \n\
    multispectral \nsatellite data, which is a cheaper method for defining \nmanagement\
    \ zones.\nWe emphasized that the creation of \nmanagement zones for irrigation\
    \ is not strictly \nassociated with the application of water at a varied rate\
    \ \nbut rather in specific fields or areas and not exclusively \non a lateral\
    \ line of an irrigation system. The creation of \nthese zones can help in the\
    \ sizing of localized irrigation \nsystems, enabling the differentiation of water\
    \ needs by \nsector, such as ZM, which differs from SS-VRI (site-\nspecific variable\
    \ rate sprinkler).\nAnother point to consider is the limitations \nof the use\
    \ of remote sensing to create ZM. \nFONTANET et al. (2020) suggested the integration\
    \ \nof spatial and temporal information, since there are \nsoil and/or plant attributes\
    \ with spatial differences \nthat also change over time; that is, they are not\
    \ static. \nFor example, the NDVI must be combined with a \nmeasurement of available\
    \ soil water to dynamically \ndelineate both space and time ZM for irrigation.\n\
    Irrigation systems with variable water application rates\nIrrigated agriculture\
    \ is one of the \nagricultural activities with the highest consumption \nof fresh\
    \ water in the world. In this sense, precision \nirrigation is an important tool\
    \ for the development \nof profitable and sustainable agriculture (DU et al.,\
    \ \n2015; MATEOS & ARAUS, 2016). \nThus, as discussed in the previous section,\
    \ \nthe creation of irrigation management zones is \nessential to increase the\
    \ efficiency of the application \nand use of water in the field. Within this tool,\
    \ Site-\nspecific Variable Rate Irrigation (SS-VRI) is a \nmanagement method that\
    \ consists of applying water \naccording to spatial variability due to characteristics,\
    \ \nsuch as soil and culture; and therefore, through \nrational application, it\
    \ is possible to increase water \nconservation and productivity, in addition to\
    \ reducing \nthe leaching rate of nutrients and agrochemicals and \noptimizing\
    \ inputs (DU et al., 2015; MATEOS & \nARAUS, 2016).\nSS-VRI differs from conventional\
    \ sprinkler \nsystems and requires variable rate sprinklers, which \nare based\
    \ mainly on pulse modulation, angle of \ndeparture and arrival points, and sprinkler\
    \ head \n(SADLER et al., 2005).The main research covers \nlinear and center pivot\
    \ sprinkler systems due to the \nlevel of automation and coverage of the cultivation\
    \ \narea through a single side tube (ADEYEMI et al., \n2017). However, this type\
    \ of management has \nalready been studied for other types of irrigation \nmethods,\
    \ such as drip, considering the challenges of \ndirectionality and the invariable\
    \ rate of lateral lines \n(LINKER, 2020). Therefore, the main commercial \nequipment\
    \ developed thus far is linked to central \npivot and linear mechanized sprinkler\
    \ irrigation.\nThe greatest success of implementing VRI \nin center pivot systems,\
    \ and the focus of this review, \nis that it allows: first, the control of the\
    \ travel speed \n10\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nof the center\
    \ pivot, allowing the variation of water \napplication/infiltration depth by sector,\
    \ and second, \ncontrolling the variation of water application by zone; \nthat\
    \ is, it allows the differentiation of irrigation rates \nalong the lateral pipeline\
    \ (ANDRADE et al., 2020; \nO’SHAUGHNESSY et al., 2019; SUI & YAN, 2017).\nSOBENKO\
    \ et al. (2018) developed a \nsprinkler with flow adjustment through the cross\
    \ \nsection based on an iris mechanism controlled by \na stepper motor using a\
    \ deterministic model for \nflow prediction, but the idealized nozzle discharge\
    \ \ncoefficient (0.60) was below the average values \n(0.90–0.92) observed in\
    \ conventional fixed nozzles.\nThe management of SS-VRI can be carried \nout efficiently\
    \ in several ways, such as monitoring the \nsoil moisture content, a subject discussed\
    \ in greater \ndepth in sections 1 and 4. For this, the positioning \nand number\
    \ of sensors should be chosen with care so \nthat the generated data are representative\
    \ of the area \nunder cultivation. Through analyses of variance and \ntemporal\
    \ stability of soil water content monitored by a \nneutron probe, BARKER et al.\
    \ (2017) concluded that \nfor management zones divided to minimize variations\
    \ \nwithin the zones, the number of sensors may be \nmore important than their\
    \ position in the area. In \naddition, due to the high cost of a number of sensors,\
    \ \na partnership between modeling and monitoring soil \nwater is proposed. In\
    \ a similar study focusing on the \nplacement of soil sensors, ZHAO et al. (2017)\
    \ stated \nthat the clay percentile of management zones should \nbe considered\
    \ for the placement of sensors.\nThe use of spectral images obtained \nvia satellite\
    \ or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \nhas been used in the management of variable-rate\
    \ \nirrigation systems. The principle of this use is based on \nunderstanding\
    \ the spectral response of the leaf, which \nis applied at the canopy level and\
    \ is used to establish \nmanagement zones (HANK et al., 2018). MENDES et \nal.\
    \ (2019), using images obtained from satellites, carried \nout the mapping of\
    \ areas considering the variability for \nthe application of variable-rate irrigation\
    \ depths via the \ncentral pivot system. With the same objective, SHI et \nal.\
    \ (2019), with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAVs), obtained multispectral\
    \ images of the vegetation \nand used vegetation indices to determine the spatial\
    \ \nvariability and constitution of homogeneous areas. \nSimilar work was developed\
    \ by BHATTI et al. (2020), in \nwhich the comparison of multispectral images obtained\
    \ \nby UAV and satellites was performed to evaluate the \nresponse of crops to\
    \ variable irrigation based on canopy \ntemperature and surface energy balance\
    \ modeling. More \nexamples of the use of images in precision irrigation are \n\
    mentioned in sections 2 and 3.\nDespite all the benefits, the uptake of \nSS-VRI\
    \ systems has grown slowly. The main \njustifications for this are that this type\
    \ of management \nrequires qualified technical assistance, and the \nacquisition\
    \ of the necessary equipment still has a high \ncost, requiring a careful analysis\
    \ of the economic \nviability of production (ABIOYE et al., 2020). To \nassist\
    \ in these matters, simulation models are viable \noptions for assessing the response\
    \ of crops to different \nirrigation management methods.\nMCCARTHY et al. (2014)\
    \ used a model \ncalled VARIwise based on the predictive control \nmodel methodology\
    \ to evaluate the performance of \ncotton cultures grown on a center pivot with\
    \ variable \napplication rate irrigation compared to conventional \nsystems. In\
    \ most results, simulations of precision \nirrigation performance had superior\
    \ results. In a \nsimilar research, THORP (2019) carried out a long-\nterm evaluation\
    \ through simulations using the same \ncrop under soil variability parameters\
    \ to analyze the \nadvantages of the system. However, modeling applied \nto precision\
    \ irrigation can be complex because it deals \nwith the dynamics of water in soil.\
    \ The following \ntopic discusses in-depth examples of models and \napplications\
    \ of modeling in irrigated agriculture. \nModeling agricultural crops and their\
    \ interaction \nwith the prescription of variable water depths in \nprecision\
    \ irrigation\nExtreme drought events have increased \nin intensity in recent decades\
    \ and predictions from \nagrometeorological modeling indicate that climate \n\
    extremes of drought will become more frequent and \nprolonged due to a set of\
    \ factors, among which global \nwarming stands out (IPCC, 2018).\nAgriculture\
    \ is one of the human activities \nmost dependent on climatic conditions, especially\
    \ \ntraditional rainfed crops, so the development \nof studies to evaluate the\
    \ effects of these on \nagricultural production is important. However, \ncarrying\
    \ out field experiments becomes limiting due \nto a series of factors, such as\
    \ manpower, available \ntime and financial resources. An alternative or \ncomplementary\
    \ solution is the use of agricultural \nmodeling to forecast the development of\
    \ agricultural \ncrops in new climate scenarios.\nCrop simulation models are based\
    \ on \nbiophysical processes to make estimates such as \ngrowth, development and\
    \ production, based on \nphysiological characteristics of the crop in question\
    \ \nand environmental variables (MONTEITH, 1996). \nUnderstanding these models\
    \ becomes the conceptual \nbasis for modeling agricultural crops.\nPrecision irrigation\
    \ trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n11\nMechanistic\
    \ models, based on the physics \nand physiological processes of plants, become\
    \ allies \nin the development of teaching, research and crop \nmanagement. Among\
    \ them, the DSSAT (Decision \nSupport System for Agrotechnology Transfer) presents\
    \ \na set of models developed for several important crops, \nsuch as corn and\
    \ soybean (JONES et al., 2003).\nIn a review of the opportunities and \napproaches\
    \ for modeling spatial variations of water \nat the field level, TENREIRO et al.\
    \ (2020) pointed \nout that, among the irrigation methods, there are \nthree ways\
    \ to simulate irrigation applications in crop \nmodels: a) determination of a\
    \ calendar by the user; \nb) an irrigation program based on the water capacity\
    \ \nof the soil, applying constant or variable rates; and c) \nthrough a schedule\
    \ based on multiple criteria, such as \nthe phenological stage of the crop, water\
    \ content in the \nsoil, restrictions on the availability of water and type \n\
    of cultural management. These methodologies have \nthe potential to calculate\
    \ the varied rate of irrigation \nto be provided to plants, “when,” “where” and\
    \ “how \nmuch” they need, resulting in the optimization of \nthe use of this water\
    \ resource (HAGHVERDI et al., \n2016), thus validating the three ways to simulate\
    \ \nfield-level irrigation applications in the models.\nIn the literature, the\
    \ prescription of \nvariable irrigation depths follows two methodologies: \na)\
    \ make individual use of crop simulation models or \nhydrological models, which\
    \ focus on the movement \nof water in the soil and b) make combined use of \n\
    these two models.\nThe DSSAT model, because it is a \nsimulation of cultivation,\
    \ is advantageous in the study \nof irrigation management scenarios, as presented\
    \ by \nMALIK & DECHMI (2019) in a study carried out \nin Spain with different\
    \ cultures. They evaluated \ntwo scenarios, one based on irrigation applied by\
    \ \nproducers and another on irrigation adjusted to \nthe water demand of the\
    \ crop, with crop and soil \ndata collected for model calibration and validation.\
    \ \nThe authors reported up to a 27% reduction in the \napplication of irrigation\
    \ depths. Similar researches are \npresented by CAMARGO & KEMANIAN (2016), \n\
    PEREZ-ORTOLA et al. (2015) and XIANGXIANG \net al. (2013).\nAnother well-established\
    \ model is APSIM, \nwhich also focuses on modeling agricultural crops and \nassesses\
    \ the impacts of different crop management \npractices, including irrigation (AMARASINGHA\
    \ et \nal., 2015; DUTTA et al., 2020).\nPEREA et al. (2017), for example, carried\
    \ \nout an integrative modeling coupling a deterministic \nmodel of water application\
    \ with the Aquacrop model, \nsimulating the impacts of heterogeneous irrigation\
    \ \ncaused by wind drift and pressure variation in the \nirrigation system. They\
    \ concluded that variable-rate \nirrigation was the best method in all scenarios\
    \ of \npressure variation in the system to save water and \nincrease onion yield.\n\
    ROY et al. (2019) also proposed the \nintegration of crop and hydrological models\
    \ using \nHYDRUS-2D software and DSSAT to identify the \nmost appropriate irrigation\
    \ management to maximize \nwater use efficiency through precision irrigation using\
    \ \nretention technology of subsurface water, together \nwith a computational\
    \ procedure of evolutionary multi-\nobjective optimization to link the two models.\
    \ The \nauthors concluded that the optimization procedure \nreduced water use\
    \ and increased corn yield prediction \nby 6-fold compared to non-optimized and\
    \ randomized \nirrigation management without subsurface water \nretention membrane.\
    \ For the combination of models, \nanother proposal developed by GARCÍA-VILA \n\
    & FERERES (2012), in which they combined the \nAquaCrop model with an economic\
    \ optimization \nmodel, identified irrigation strategies and predicted \ntheir\
    \ impact on income. in which the simulated \nresults indicated that the best strategy\
    \ under water \nrestrictions combined the planting of crops with low \nwater use\
    \ in part of the area as a way of making more \nwater available for the most profitable\
    \ crops and with \nthe greatest water need.\nIn this review, several premises\
    \ involving \nprecision irrigation were addressed, from the use of \nsoil sensors,\
    \ remote sensing, artificial intelligence, \nmanagement zones for irrigation,\
    \ and variable-\nrate irrigation to agricultural modeling in view of \noptimizing\
    \ the use of water resources. However, there \nare other techniques and technologies\
    \ used in RI that \nhelp in the efficient use of both water and energy \nresources,\
    \ such as the use of wastewater (IBEKWE \net al., 2018; SHANNAG et al., 2021;\
    \ VERGINE et \nal., 2016), solar panels to reduce energy costs with \nwater pumping\
    \ and automation in irrigation systems \n(GRANT et al., 2022; SINGH et al., 2021)\
    \ and \nthe use of microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) to \nmitigate damage caused\
    \ by water deficit (ASHWIN \net al., 2022).\nCONCLUSION\nThis review of trends\
    \ and prospects for \nprecision irrigation for irrigation monitoring and \nmanagement\
    \ is based on relevant past and current \nresearch work that has contributed to\
    \ achieving \ngreater water savings in agriculture. It is hoped that \n12\nCiência\
    \ Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nthis review article has given a broad\
    \ overview of \nresearch trends and generated new ideas for readers \non implementation\
    \ and execution approaches \nto choosing the best smart irrigation strategy, \n\
    paying attention to the fact that the combination of \nmonitoring methods via\
    \ soil, plant and climate is \nthe most assertive strategy to increase the energy\
    \ \nefficiency of water use in irrigated fields. However, \nit results in a large\
    \ volume of data to be analyzed, \nmaking it necessary to use algorithms based\
    \ on \nartificial intelligence, which promotes a fast and \nefficient monitoring\
    \ system of the collected data, \naiming the assertive recommendation of irrigation\
    \ at \na variable rate in the area irrigated to save water and \nenergy so as\
    \ not to overload the irrigating farmer with \nthe daily decision in determining\
    \ the irrigation dose.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors want to thank the scientific\

    Abstract: As the global population continues to increase, projected to reach an
    estimated 9.7 billion

    people by 2050, there will be a growing demand for food production and agricultural
    resources.

    Transition toward Agriculture 4.0 is expected to enhance agricultural productivity
    through the

    integration of advanced technologies, increase resource efﬁciency, ensure long-term
    food security by

    applying more sustainable farming practices, and enhance resilience and climate
    change adaptation.

    By integrating technologies such as ground IoT sensing and remote sensing, via
    both satellite

    and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and exploiting data fusion and data analytics,
    farming

    can make the transition to a more efﬁcient, productive, and sustainable paradigm.
    The present

    work performs a systematic literature review (SLR), identifying the challenges
    associated with UAV,

    Satellite, and Ground Sensing in their application in agriculture, comparing them
    and discussing

    their complementary use to facilitate Precision Agriculture (PA) and transition
    to Agriculture 4.0.

    Keywords: UAV; IoT; satellite; Precision Agriculture; proximal sensing; remote
    sensing; challenges

    1. Introduction

    Worldwide food production is a more sensitive issue than ever before. The global

    population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, adding an extra 2.4 billion
    to the global

    urban population, and increasing overall demand for food production by 70 percent
    [1].

    At the same time, reduced rural population, degraded farmlands [2], climate change

    decreasing agricultural productivity [3], and food waste [4] make this requirement
    quite

    difﬁcult to meet unless the agricultural productive model changes dramatically.
    To this end,

    Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth Agricultural Revolution, promises a technological
    revolution

    for enhanced agricultural productivity and increased eco-efﬁciency [5]. Driven
    by the wider

    Industry 4.0 paradigm shift, Agriculture 4.0 brings to the agricultural sector
    a number of

    mainstream technologies, including sensing infrastructures, big data analytics,
    Artiﬁcial

    Intelligence, Blockchain, and robotics [6]. It thus engages in a unifying model
    pertinent to

    different domains of human activity ([7,8]), recognizing cyberphysical systems
    and their

    components as a key element in this transition [9] and targeting an increase in
    the overall

    quality of life leading to Society 5.0 paradigm [10].

    Sensing plays an important role in the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm shift. Obtaining
    the

    necessary information from the ﬁeld may be achieved by exploiting different technological

    options that include ground-based sensors, or remote sensing techniques ([11,12]).
    The

    former are strongly associated with technologies such as the Internet of Things
    (IoT) ([13,14])

    and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [15], as well as Wireless Sensor
    Networks

    (WSNs) [16]. The latter may be distinguished from airborne remote sensing utilizing

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and spaceborne remote sensing exploiting satellite
    data.

    The present work performs a systematic review related to the three aforementioned

    main technologies with reference to their application in agriculture. The main
    research

    questions (RQs) that the authors wish to answer in this work are the following:

    RQ1

    What are the challenges of the three technologies that this work deals with?

    RQ2

    How can these three technologies be used in a complementary way so as to facilitate

    the transition to Agriculture 4.0?

    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. An overview of the three aforementioned

    categories of sensing technologies is presented in Section 2. The methodology
    followed

    for the systematic review is showcased in Section 3. The outcome of the literature
    review

    performed is elaborated in Section 4 detailing the challenges and synergies found
    for

    the three technologies under investigation. Section 5 presents a discussion providing
    the

    paper’s view on the research questions formulated. Finally, Section 6 presents
    conclusions

    and identiﬁes potential future research directions.

    2. Overview of Sensing Technologies

    2.1. Ground-Based Sensing

    Ground or proximal sensors play a key role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Proximal

    sensing is deﬁned as the use of ﬁeld sensors to obtain signals from the analyzed
    feature

    (e.g., climate, soil, or plant) when the sensor is in contact with or close to
    it (within

    a few meters) ([17,18]). Nowadays, there are many types of proximal sensors capable

    of monitoring multiple parameters related mainly to the plant water, nutritional,
    and

    health status [19]. Another classiﬁcation includes the division into static proximal
    sensors,

    which remain stationary in the ﬁeld, or mobile proximal sensors, mounted on vehicles
    or

    robots [20].

    It is well known that climate is one of the main aspects determining plant growth

    and outputs [21]. This occurs because each plant is sensitive to certain growing
    conditions

    such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind, soil temperature, and light.
    Thus, it

    is crucial for farmers to understand the climatic conditions on their farms [22].
    Hence,

    meteorological information may help the farmer make the most efﬁcient use of natural

    resources to improve agricultural production. Among the most common proximal sensors

    are those that can assess climatic parameters. Usually, such sensors are mounted
    in small

    weather stations in the ﬁeld, and a basic weather station usually consists of
    a temperature

    and humidity sensor, a wind speed sensor, a sensor that measures precipitation
    height, and

    one that can assess solar radiation information.

    Another category of ground-based sensors is soil-based sensors. New-generation

    proximal soil-based sensors are able to monitor real-time physical and chemical
    soil pa-

    rameters, such as moisture, temperature, pH, soil nutrients, and pollutants, providing
    key

    information to optimize crop cycle management, combat biotic and abiotic stresses,
    and

    improve crop yields.

    One of the most common uses of such sensing is for irrigation management, through

    the capability of estimating the crop reference evapotranspiration (ETO), returning
    to the

    plant the full or partial (depending on the farm irrigation strategy) amount of
    water lost by

    evapotranspiration, using the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation recommended by the

    United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [23]. Weather observations

    and forecasts, coupled with physical observations, can help predict the development
    of

    the main pests and can be used to schedule control actions to prevent pest development.

    Thanks to such information, it is possible to change plant microclimate and inﬂuence

    the habitability for pests, for example, through pruning operations to reduce
    internal

    canopy humidity and reduce the probability of infection by plant pathogens. Integrated

    pest management has been a response to reduce the environmental impact of chemical

    pesticides [24].

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    3 of 32

    For irrigation scheduling nowadays, there is a tendency to focus on plant-based
    sensors.

    Common and reliable sensors capable of continuously estimating plant water status
    include

    leaf turgor sensors, devices capable of assessing leaf turgor pressure, a parameter
    directly

    related to plant water status; sapflow sensors, capable of providing indications
    of the plant

    transpiration flows; trunk dendrometers, capable of monitoring trunk fluctuations
    over

    time, dependent on the plant hydration status; and Linear Variable Differential
    Transformer

    (LVDT) fruit gauges [25]. The latter are low-cost devices that can continuously
    and very

    accurately monitor fruit development over the day, providing information about
    plant water

    and nutritional status during the fruit growth stage ([26,27]).

    Although plant-based sensors for monitoring plant water status are among the most

    common, there are other devices that are very useful for crop management. Foliar
    wetness

    sensors are devices installed inside the canopy to assess its moisture status,
    preventing the

    rise of pathogens and diseases [28]. Optical sensors, working in the visible/near-infrared

    band, can be useful for estimating the nutritional and health status of the plant
    ([29,30]).

    On the other hand, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology sensors can
    be used

    to assess and measure canopy shape and volume [31].

    Last-generation sensors allow continuous data acquisition, greatly increasing
    the

    degree of information without increasing the farm workload. Moreover, these sensors

    can be used to create IoT networks for various applications [32]. IoT focuses
    primarily

    on providing many small, interconnected devices, mainly using WSN technology,
    that

    can work together with a common purpose [33]. A WSN has as a main target of offering

    sensing and monitoring capabilities utilizing wireless technologies to connect
    to sensing

    devices. In WSNs, data collection and transfer occur in four stages: collecting
    the data,

    processing the data, packaging the data, and transferring the data [34]. With
    the help of

    WSN technologies, farmers can analyze weather conditions, water use, energy use,
    soil

    conditions, and plant morpho-physiological parameters collected from their farm
    feeding

    decision-support systems (DSSs) [35]. WSN has to fulﬁll requirements such as long
    range,

    low energy, and adequate data rate. Several technologies, including Long-Range
    Wide Area

    Network (LoRaWAN) [36], Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) [37], SigFox [38], and Long-Term

    Evolution for Machines (LTE-M) [39], are arising as candidates in the upcoming
    transition

    to 5G communications [40].

    In the context of this paper, and from this point on, we use the term IoT to collectively

    describe the different technologies associated with ground-based proximal sensing.

    2.2. Remote Sensing Techniques

    UAVs were used in agriculture in 1997 for the ﬁrst time. This technology was ﬁrst

    used in Japan and South Korea, where mountainous terrain and relatively small
    family-

    owned farms required lower-cost and higher-precision spraying. Historically, the
    use

    of aerial application of pesticides was prohibited by the European Union, inhibiting
    the

    growth of UAV application in agriculture. Later use of UAVs was centered mainly
    around

    aerial imagery.

    Nowadays, UAVs are applied in PA to collect images of high quality, mounting

    adequate sensors to this end. Sensor choice is carried out carefully according
    to a number

    of parameters such as resolution, optical quality, weight, captured images, and
    price.

    UAVs may carry multiple types of sensors: RGB (red–green–blue), NIR (near-infrared),

    IR (infrared), multispectral (MS), and hyperspectral (HS) cameras. RGB and NIR
    bands

    are useful for collecting information about vegetation stress and chlorophyll
    content [41].

    Furthermore, LiDAR sensors can also be used in environmental sciences for terrestrial

    scanning, obtaining information on crop height or canopy size [42].

    Each type of sensor can be utilized for monitoring diverse parameters in vegetation.

    RGB is low in cost and useful for UAV applications of precision farming, such
    as the

    creation of orthomosaics, as they can capture images with high resolution. In
    addition,

    they are useful in different conditions (sunny and cloudy weather). But they cannot

    analyze many vegetation indices due to their limited spectral range. MS and HS
    sensors,

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    4 of 32

    compared to RGB, collect data in different spectral channels and acquire images
    with high

    quality that are useful for studying a multitude of physical and biological characteristics

    of plantations [43]. Therefore, MS and HS sensors are the most popular in PA,
    although

    they are expensive. Moreover, thermal sensors are used to collect temperature
    information.

    Their use proves to be optimal in irrigation-management applications [43]. The
    speciﬁc

    targeted application type is what dictates the adequate selection of sensors.
    For instance,

    MS sensors are suitable for the detection of diseases, offering many bands that
    can detect

    the sensitivity of symptoms. On the other hand, one RGB camera should be enough
    for

    data collection related to agricultural mapping.

    The most well-known applications of UAVs for PA, as found in the literature, include

    weed mapping and management [44], irrigation management [45], crop spraying [46],

    vegetation health monitoring and diseases detection [47], and vegetation growth
    monitoring

    and yield estimation [43]. UAVs acquire information that can be useful for the
    measurement

    of different parameters such as the crop height and the Leaf Area Index (LAI),
    allowing

    crop growth control in crops such as cotton, wheat, or sorghum. UAVs can be used
    to

    calculate the most common vegetative index to determine the diseased tissue, i.e.,
    the

    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is useful for monitoring
    crop health

    and detecting diseases at an early stage, also mapping the size of the defect.
    In addition,

    a very important ﬁeld of UAV application is water management, as precision irrigation

    techniques improve the efﬁciency of water use resources [43]. UAVs have rapidly
    evolved

    into a common tool to increase agricultural output and overall efﬁciency, decreasing

    expensive inputs of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. They can also indicate
    damages in

    crops that cannot be easily detected from the ground and be applicable in areas
    of big

    dimensions [48].

    Finally, spaceborne remote sensing satellites equipped with digital RGB cameras
    and

    MS or HS sensors are nowadays among the most widely used technologies in monitoring

    ﬁeld variability, which usually includes landscape monitoring, yield, ﬁeld, soil
    and crop

    variability, or variability due to anomalous factors [49]. By measuring the reﬂectance
    of the

    light incident on soil and crops, they are used to assess their characteristics
    and behavior by

    acquiring information at different spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal
    resolutions.

    Similarly to UAV-based remote sensing, information acquired from satellites is
    usually

    expressed by indices, among which the NDVI index is one of the most widely used.
    Each

    index is calculated from values at visible and non-visible wavelengths: red, green,
    blue,

    near-infrared, red edge, and infrared bands are the most frequently used ([12,50]).

    Every satellite and sensor is characterized by different spatial and temporal
    resolutions.

    Temporal resolution is associated with the satellite itself and can be considered
    as the time

    the satellite takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area.
    Sensors,

    instead, can have high spatial resolution and tend to have small footprints, or
    they have

    low spatial resolution and tend to have larger footprints. As Vanguard 2 and TIROS
    1

    were launched in 1959 and 1960, respectively, and are used for assessing meteorological

    information, the history of satellites for agricultural use starts in 1972 with
    Landsat 1

    (1972–1978), a satellite capturing multispectral data for earth-surface image
    acquisition.

    After that, a series of Landsat satellites (from 2 to 9) were launched. Used in
    many parts

    of the world, these satellites (Landsat-7, -8, and -9 are still active) provide
    high-quality

    images in order to classify land uses, monitor crop conditions, and estimate irrigation

    water requirements, resulting in more affordable imagery than the aerial photography

    once used to classify land use across large regions. Later, from the end of the
    1990s to

    the 2010s, other satellites were launched, such as IKONOS (1999–2015), which provides

    4 m spatial resolution images; Worldview-2 (2009–present); and GeoEye-1 (2008–present),

    with a ≤2 m resolution; Sentinel-2A (2014–present) and -2B (2015–present), with
    a 10 to

    60 m resolution; and other satellites constellations such as Pleiades-1A (2011–present)

    and -1B (2012–present), SkySat-1 (2013–present) and -2 (2014–present), or Superview-

    1 (2016–present), namely small satellites with compact, cheaper, and more replaceable

    sensors [51]. The primary beneﬁts of this type of technology use are widely documented
    in

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    5 of 32

    the literature and include reduced environmental impact, increased crop yield,
    enhanced

    product quality, and input savings ([52–54]). Despite the number and variety of
    satellite

    data being made available at various costs and for different purposes, there are
    certain

    challenges to using satellite imaging closely related to the purpose of the study.

    3. Methodology

    The present review was conducted following the guidelines set by the Preferred

    Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) method-

    ology [55]. The PRISMA statement consists of a checklist of 27 items recommended
    for

    reporting in systematic literature reviews. This checklist was designed to help
    reviewers

    report the purpose of the review, the methodology that was followed, and the outcomes
    of

    their research. This section provides answers to the PRISMA 2020 statement item
    checklist,

    giving a comprehensive illustration of the methodology followed in the present
    work.

    As the technology of sensors rapidly advances, a review of current literature
    in PA is

    needed to put into scope the available technologies, their competition, the cases
    that are

    most favorable for their application, and how to best utilize them in unison to
    maximize

    agricultural sustainability and proﬁt for farmers. This review was conducted with
    the

    mindset of bringing to the fore the challenges of the three technologies that
    currently play

    a central role in the future of PA and sustainable development. To the knowledge
    of the

    authors, a systematic review with the scope of attempting to synthesize the literature
    for

    these three technologies has not been attempted before, testifying to the novelty
    of the

    current work. This study answers the two RQs that were mentioned in the introduction.

    According to the RQs, the following search query was formulated:

    TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Precision Agriculture” AND (((UAV OR Satellite) AND “Remote Sensing”)

    OR IoT))

    All results obtained from this query also had to fulﬁl the following criteria:

    •

    Should be written in English,

    •

    Should be published after 2017,

    •

    Should be published in Q1 and Q2 journals.

    All studies that met the criteria proceeded to the ﬁrst screening phase. During
    this

    phase, all six authors split the remaining papers between themselves and skimmed
    through

    the abstract and the main text for phrases mentioning challenges or synergies
    for the

    three technologies. At this phase, only phrases were sought. All works that survived
    this

    stage passed through a second screening phase, during which remaining works were
    split

    between two reviewers and carefully read through. The reviewers had to ascertain
    to what

    degree each study analysed the challenge or the synergy it mentioned. If the analysis
    of the

    challenge or synergy was profound enough, the work was ﬁnally admitted for inclusion.

    The aforementioned query and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database
    on

    6 October 2022.

    The explanation for the choice of this query was that the application of these
    three

    technologies in PA was sought for sensing purposes; therefore, “remote sensing”
    was added

    with an AND for UAVs and satellites to exclude other uses, e.g., spraying. Furthermore,

    the term “IoT” was regarded as more appropriate when paired with “Precision Agriculture”

    to provide a representative set of relevant works, and was preferred over terms
    such as

    “Wireless Sensor Networks” or “Ground Sensors”.

    The aforementioned query produced a result of 435 articles. Out of these, 383
    were arti-

    cles published in Q1 and Q2 journals. These 383 articles were divided equally
    among the six

    authors for the ﬁrst screening phase. Articles that had no mention of challenges,
    or synergy

    of technologies, were eliminated. The ﬁrst screening phase eliminated a further
    172 works.

    Therefore, 211 works made it to the second screening phase, during which 24 works
    were

    excluded, leading to a total of 187 articles. Looking through these 187 records,
    it was

    evident that synergies were underrepresented, as only 6 works mentioned a substantial

    synergy. Citation searching had to be performed to ensure that the contemporary
    literature

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    6 of 32

    on synergies was adequately represented. Citation searching added a further 18
    records,

    for a total of 205 records to be admitted for inclusion in the ﬁnal review. Figure
    1 presents

    a ﬂowchart giving an overview of the screening phases and the steps followed for
    the

    systematic literature review.

    Figure 1. Systematic Literature Review Flowchart.

    During the second screening phase, all challenges found by the authors were added
    to

    a spreadsheet. Subsequently, these challenges were grouped together. These groups
    can be

    found in Tables 1 and 2 for UAVs, Tables 3 and 4 for satellites, and Tables 5
    and 6 for IoT.

    Papers that mentioned synergies where sparse among the body of results. These
    works are

    described in their own Section 4.4.

    In order to give a sufﬁcient deﬁnition of what a challenge is and what a synergy
    is, we

    refer to the following. A challenge is any type of impedance or problem that challenges

    the use of a particular technology in PA. For example, for UAVs, a challenge could
    be

    their short ﬂight times, for satellites their lower resolution, and for ground
    sensors their

    inﬂexibility. Synergy is an idea that fuses together traits from two or more technologies

    to produce an effect that improves the use of both and augments each technology’s
    value

    overall. The high-resolution images acquired by UAV, combined with the wide coverage

    and high spectral resolution of satellite images, constitutes a good example of
    a synergy.

    Both challenges and synergies were sought in all examined papers, with the prerequisite

    that they were sufﬁciently analyzed in the review text. Therefore, it was much
    more

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    7 of 32

    probable to encounter UAV challenges in a UAV-centric paper than in an IoT-centric
    or a

    satellite-centric paper.

    To reduce bias, the two ﬁrst authors double-checked the ﬁndings of each of the
    six

    authors during the second phase of deciding paper eligibility. Any paper that
    mentioned a

    well-analysed and evidence-supported phrase that met the challenge or synergy
    criteria

    was eligible for synthesis. During the second screening, a further 24 papers were
    excluded.

    After this step, the number of records was reduced to 187. Out of those papers,
    six of them

    discussed a synergy of the technologies. Citation searching was performed to identify
    more

    records mentioning synergies, which added another 18 records, for a total of 205.

    Synthesis of the results required that the phrases extracted from each paper described,

    in their core, the same basic challenge in order to be grouped with similar phrases
    from

    other papers. For example, papers mentioning UAV instability when carrying heavy

    equipment and UAV reduction in ﬂight time due to heavy payloads were all grouped
    under

    the payload-limitation challenge because they describe the wider challenge that
    UAVs

    face when there is need to equip them with heavy payloads. As each challenge is
    further

    elaborated upon in the main text, the particular details of each phrase are not
    lost. The

    grouping helps to provide a summary of the challenge in a form that is quick and
    easy on

    the eye and captures how many works have mentioned it in the past.

    4. Results

    This section presents the results for the synthesis of the challenges for each
    technology

    in three subsections and the results for synergies in the fourth subsection.

    4.1. UAV Challenges

    This subsection provides the results of the categorization of challenges for UAV
    tech-

    nology. Table 2 presents the types of challenges for implementing UAV technology
    in

    agriculture that are peripherally related to the use of UAVs. The categories that
    were

    observed in this case were economic, social, and governmental challenges, as well
    as one

    miscellaneous challenge. Table 1 presents the type of challenges for implementing
    UAV

    technology in agriculture that are native to the UAV technology, and hence, occur
    according

    to the UAV system itself. The categories that were observed in this case were
    challenges

    concerning the sensors, the system security, the data processing, and the system
    hardware.

    Moreover, future research challenges for implementing UAV technology in agriculture
    are

    also investigated and included. Figure 2 presents these groups of challenges found
    in the

    literature that was examined.

    Figure 2. UAV Challenges Mentioned in the Literature.

    Most commercially available UAVs come out of the box with cheap RGB sensors that

    lack the precision and spectral range for PA applications (for example, for calculating

    NVDI) [58]. It is necessary to equip UAVs with MS sensors, increasing the overall
    cost,

    and even then, cheaper MS sensors face saturation issues [59], especially since
    there are no

    standardized methods for their calibration [72]. The calibration of UAV sensors
    presents a

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    11 of 32

    challenge because camera position on a UAV might be slightly different for each
    ﬂight [59],

    and differences in the orientation of the sensor result in different calibrations
    each time.

    This is especially true with HS sensors, as the slightest tilt has a negative
    impact in the

    sensor calibration [80]. With reference to HS sensors, although they have become
    more

    lightweight and cheaper, they are still a relatively expensive investment, and
    the processing

    of their output data remains extremely complex. Therefore, UAVs present a less
    cost-

    effective option for high spectral resolution when compared to satellites [129].
    According

    to [71], another challenge for UAVs is their dependence on payload. Equipping
    the UAV

    with multiple sensors is not recommended, as it reduces ﬂight time and affects
    its balance

    mid-ﬂight ([81,86]). Therefore, careful choice must be made about which sensors
    to use and

    equip the platform with during each ﬂight, resulting in the need for multiple
    ﬂights when

    measurements from multiple sensors are required.

    All data generated as an outcome of the UAV trips need to be processed to be useful.

    Some issues arise during this stage. As sensors become better and spatial resolution
    increases,

    the volume of acquired data increases, and UAV use in PA is faced with extreme
    data

    bloat ([81,110,111]). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, data acquisition is not
    standardized,

    adding to the already considerable computing complexity of UAV images ([57,86]).
    On top

    of that, the UAV itself can do little to share the burden of data processing as
    its computing

    capabilities are very limited ([81,111]). When these ultra-high resolution data
    are used for

    machine learning (ML) training, it can take quite a while to complete ([72,106]),
    even though

    the final results are more trustworthy and useful than training the ML algorithms
    with satellite

    acquired images. Higher resolution is not always a panacea when it is employed
    for disease

    classification. The currently developed plant disease classification methods have
    maximum

    resolution thresholds, which, when surpassed, result in their algorithm underperforming.

    Nevertheless, the highest resolutions can be capitalized on in object recognition
    algorithms

    that perform disease analysis at the individual plant level [117]. Another issue
    is that if

    these data are to be given to some company or organization for processing, issues
    of data

    governance arise, as well as security of sensitive data ([64,72,82]).

    Furthermore, as the usage of UAVs in agriculture is still in an early stage [123],
    more

    research is needed to identify the costs and beneﬁts of the implementation of
    this tech-

    nology. For example, [125] recommended the actualization of more studies concerning

    the validation of low-cost sensors’ results in different conditions. Moreover,
    according

    to [71,82], there is a need for the development of fully autonomous UAVs. Ref.
    [79] also

    discussed the implementation of multiple coordinated UAVs in an individual ﬁeld.
    Finally,

    the path optimization of UAVs, in order to monitor a whole ﬁeld with adequate
    accuracy,

    is mentioned in [71,75].

    UAVs’ application challenges exceed the purely technical aspects. Using a UAV
    for PA

    requires a large upfront investment from farmers ([118,127]), and even then, continuous
    use

    can be expensive as well [86]. This high initial cost is a considerable risk,
    as remote sensing

    is not a standardized procedure for every type of crop and in every environment,
    and its

    performance can wildly vary depending on these parameters [86]. The need for skills
    and

    a proper way of handling UAVs ([58,66,132]) are further impeding factors. Knowledge

    of repair and maintenance is also a requirement [64]. Moreover, most governments
    re-

    quire special licences for UAV use, and they limit certain aspects of ﬂying, such
    as ﬂying

    height ([71,93]), and ﬂying over inhabited areas and beyond visual lines [88].

    4.2. Satellite Challenges

    The present subsection provides the results of the categorization of challenges
    for

    satellites. Table 4 presents the type of challenges for using satellites in agriculture,
    which

    are not oriented to the technology itself. The categories that were observed in
    this case

    were economic and social. Table 3 presents the challenges native to satellite
    technology. Of

    this type of challenges, the main categories that were identiﬁed were related
    to sensors,

    security, data processing, and the platform. In addition, some future research
    challenges

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    12 of 32

    are also mentioned and analyzed. Figure 3 presents these groups of challenges
    found in

    the literature that was examined.

    Figure 3. Satellite Challenges Mentioned in the Literature.

    An important drawback of satellite imagery is its lower spatial resolution compared

    to airborne images ([101,135]). Satellite images of medium or low spatial resolution
    are

    freely available but do not provide adequate data for a handful of different PA
    uses, such

    as disease monitoring, soil spectral measurement, wild weed identiﬁcation, or
    applications

    that require individual plant identiﬁcation through ML ([136–138]). Very-high-resolution

    (VHR) images from satellites are also available but incur a signiﬁcant cost. Even
    then,

    VHR satellites have trouble in applications that require object identiﬁcation
    in agricultural

    environments, as they provide less information than their airborne counterparts.
    Due to

    this lower spatial resolution, satellites are not optimal for heterogeneous environments,

    for example, for the size and distribution of most of the European olive grove
    systems or

    vineyards ([142,159]).

    Similarly to UAVs, satellites generate big data images. Their processing is a
    time-

    consuming and computationally intensive endeavour [144]. Processing these data
    under

    time constraints may affect the quality of the ﬁnal result [148]. Storing and
    managing the

    sheer volumes of imagery is a considerable challenge on its own. Furthermore,
    satellite

    data, because of their low spatial and temporal resolution, are not great candidates
    for AI

    calibration purposes or training of ML algorithms [149]. As with all big data
    applications,

    satellite imagery can also be leaked or be used by third parties for unknown purposes,
    so

    care must be taken ([72,142]).

    Another drawback of satellites is their susceptibility to cloudy weather. Depending
    on

    cloud coverage, a satellite may not be able to acquire images at all [151]. The
    consensus in

    the literature is that cloud coverage reduces satellite temporal resolution ([83,149]).
    Disease

    monitoring in particular is highly dependent on high temporal resolution; thus,
    satellite use

    for this particular application is inappropriate [158]. Satellites as a platform
    have inherently

    low temporal resolution, as they cannot be used for imaging at will but rather
    at their

    particular revisit time, but if at that moment the cloud coverage is dense, the
    chance for

    image acquisition may be lost. While satellites bearing active sensors are a solution
    to cloud

    coverage, their spatial resolution is even lower, and hence they do not solve
    the disease-

    monitoring conundrum ([57,64]). The low temporal resolution of satellites is a
    problem

    not only for disease monitoring but for monitoring in general. Satellites are
    inﬂexible

    platforms without the ability to interchange sensors at will, and waiting for
    a satellite with

    a suitable sensor for the required measurement is another cause of low temporal
    resolution.

    When the highest spatial resolution is needed from VHR satellites, they may not
    be there to

    provide it ([64,83]), but a very small number of satellites are equipped with
    both MS and

    HS sensors [129].

    With reference to future research challenges, there is a need to sufﬁciently integrate

    and connect satellites with different technologies and devices, as well as enhance
    their

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    13 of 32

    level of cooperation between one another [142]. According to [121], there is also
    the need

    to perform more research for satellites on transforming image classiﬁcation maps
    into

    application maps. Additionally, as the complexity of the usage of a satellite
    platform is a

    factor that hinders its adoption, the overall technology needs to become more
    approachable

    for farmers and be used as a DSS [155].

    Concerning the satellite technology’s peripheral challenges for applications in
    agricul-

    ture, the cost of acquiring useful information from satellite imagery incorporates
    the costs

    of taking the images and processing them. Specialized companies gather the imagery
    from

    speciﬁc satellites and process them themselves before ﬁnally delivering the ﬁnal
    product to

    the customer. Satellite data for PA have been in use for many years, more than
    UAVs, and

    the whole process is more streamlined. Still, the cost of the man-hours involved
    is high,

    particularly when data processing must be undertaken quickly [57]. All in all,
    access to

    everyone is still hindered due to the scientiﬁc and technological knowledge required
    to

    deploy an effective method that brings true and valuable results to farmers [131].

    4.3. IoT Challenges

    The present subsection provides the outcomes of the categorization of challenges
    for

    IoT technology. Table 6 presents the type of challenges for implementing IoT in
    agriculture

    that are not native to the technology itself. The categories that were identiﬁed
    from

    this case were mainly economic, social, and governmental. Table 5 presents the
    IoT-

    technology-oriented challenges. From this group of challenges, the main categories
    that

    were observed were related to sensors, security, networking, data processing,
    and future

    research challenges. Figure 4 presents these groups of challenges found in the
    literature

    that was examined.

    Figure 4. IoT Challenges Mentioned in the Literature.

    Each sensor in an IoT context comprises four parts: a sensing part, a computing

    part, a transmitting part, and a battery. The batteries are usually not rechargeable
    or

    changeable. Therefore, there is a pressing need for saving energy ([166,167,169,170]).
    Most

    of its energy is spent in transmitting sensed data back to the main station. Energy
    saving can

    be achieved by using operations with a low duty cycle, minimizing delays, or optimizing

    routing. Another challenge for IoT is the lack of reliable measurements for low-cost
    ground

    sensors [175]. For example, the measurement of soil moisture with ground sensors
    is

    challenging because the capacitive soil moisture sensors operate at low frequencies
    and

    are sensitive to the soil texture and salinity level [193]. The placement of sensors
    is another

    important challenge of incorporating IoT. Sensors have to be placed strategically
    to ensure

    maximum coverage and well-established communication between them ([91,175,192]).
    The

    difﬁculty of this task is proportional to the size of the ﬁeld. As size increases,
    the placement

    of sensors becomes more difﬁcult, and the cost of implementing a critical mass
    of sensors

    increases as well. This is known as the scalability problem ([168,172]). Harsh
    environmental

    conditions is another factor impeding ground sensors ([166,184]). Meteorological
    variables

    such as snow, fog, and solar radiance have an impact on both the sensor network
    and the

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    14 of 32

    planting [185]. The electrodes of low-cost sensors suffer deterioration quite
    quickly, and it

    is important to somehow ensure protection from adverse conditions [175]. Underground

    sensors constitute a solution to this problem, as meteorological phenomena do
    not affect

    them, and they do not impact the above-ground activities of machinery or animals,
    but at

    the cost of limited range due to interference by soil elements [191]. Another
    challenge for

    IoT is the need for sensor specialization, for each crop or disease in need of
    monitoring.

    They should be tailored to the needs of wildly different sectors in agriculture
    such as fruits,

    arable crops, or trees ([188–190]). Furthermore, all these sensors create electronic
    waste

    when they ﬁnally expire, and some of them contain harmful chemicals that are toxic
    to

    soils, crops, and stored grains [167].

    Moving on, the architecture of the network is an important aspect of designing
    an

    IoT solution. Integrating data sources and distributed sensors is complicated
    [204]. IoT

    system design in PA is based on heterogeneous network topologies that lead to
    com-

    plex communications. IoT devices have to communicate and interact seamlessly through

    different platforms and infrastructures [168]. This is worsened by non-standardized
    data-

    communication protocols [166] and different IoT node synchronization [177], as
    communi-

    cation protocols differ from crop to crop [175]. Another important aspect is the
    network

    layer itself. WiFi communications are not ideal for agricultural applications,
    which usually

    face extreme weather conditions and have insufﬁcient power structure, particularly
    when

    devices are spread far over a ﬁeld, and they work on non-rechargeable battery
    power [167].

    On the other hand, cellular communication suffers in agriculture, as the operational
    area

    is far away from antennae of cellular networks, and thus the connectivity of 3G/4G
    is

    very low. Moreover, 4G cannot support ultra-low latency with high connectivity
    because it

    allows IP-based packet switching connectivity [171]. LoRaWAN has arisen as a replacement

    for WiFi/cellular networks in agricultural IoT. While it has low bandwidth, it
    boasts very

    low energy consumption and high connectivity across vast distances [175]. Its
    drawbacks

    are that its radio-based signals are affected by vegetation foliage ([175,185,186]).
    Another

    defect is its high latency [166], but this is not always a problem in agricultural
    application,

    except if a real-time approach is taken to ﬁeld monitoring.

    From the point of view of the data processing challenge, reference is made to
    data

    bloat in [189]. Existing cloud-base storage does not provide useful solutions
    to the problem

    of manipulating the different data patterns produced by the IoT [168]. The analysis
    of these

    data is another challenge. According to [188], it has to be simpliﬁed so that
    it can be easily

    understood by most farmers. Moreover, computational efﬁciency needs to increase
    on

    the agricultural domain, and it remains a challenge to come up with efﬁcient alternatives

    to provide sufﬁcient resources to IoT in rural environments [206]. IoT networks
    that

    use WiFi—or cellular—for their network infrastructure are more vulnerable to hacking

    attacks ([192,197]). A malicious party can inﬁltrate the network and cause a wide
    number

    of issues to the IoT network. Attacks can target various aspects such as the network
    itself,

    its nodes, the data it transmits, and the code by which nodes operate. The purpose
    of

    these attacks could be brute attempts to disrupt the network and cease its operation,
    or

    more subtle malicious attacks, such as data theft and faulty operation of sensors
    that lead

    to miscalculations and false measurements ([199,200,203]). Authentication, encryption,

    and securely generated passwords are required to prevent security compromise [168].

    LoRaWAN, as it does not use the Internet and has already authentication and encryption

    systems built-in, has a higher degree of security. Furthermore, the data governance
    of IoT is

    another issue. Whoever processes the data extracted by the IoT has full access
    to sensitive

    information, and care must be taken about whom farmers entrust these data to [200].

    Future research on agricultural IoT systems may focus on many different aspects.
    An im-

    portant one is power management. Batteries of sensors that are self-rechargeable
    through solar

    power or other means would greatly enhance the capabilities of agricultural IoT
    ([166,190,201]).

    Research on an IoT capability to monitor crops in real time is another important
    character-

    istic of sensor networks that is constrained by the limited power resources [204].
    Ground

    robots bearing moving sensors need improvement in guidance systems to achieve
    smooth

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    15 of 32

    navigation through a farming environment [212]. The technology’s approachability
    for

    farmers is another issue in need of improvement. The ergonomic design of sensors,
    so that

    they can be better integrated into the farming environment, and the facilitation
    of IoT device

    implementation in a “plug-and-play” manner are desirable improvements. Finally,
    there

    are numerous voices claiming that the 5G network could revolutionize the agricultural

    sector, but concerns have been raised regarding the absolute validity of those
    claims. To

    start with, there will be high infrastructure costs, because additional stations
    are needed

    due to 5G’s shorter range. The end users’ device cost would be higher, as would
    service

    tariffs [171]. Moreover, there are doubts that 5G is an environmentally friendly
    technology,

    as widespread deployment would translate to higher use of computing devices and
    an

    increase in energy demand to power the computing devices, which would exacerbate

    climate change. It is also worth noting that certain reports have raised concerns
    about 5G’s

    high radiation [167].

    When it comes to IoT peripheral challenges, the most commonly mentioned among
    the

    papers analysed was the high costs of implementation. According to [64], the measurement

    of ground-based parameters can be costly and time-consuming, as well as requiring
    large

    amounts of human resources. Furthermore, Ref. [166] described the business issue
    of

    implementing an IoT-based system with three categories, the setup cost, the running
    cost,

    and the upgrading cost. All of these categories can incur high costs for farmers,
    making

    the adoption of IoT in agriculture a dilemma. Besides economic challenges, there
    is also a

    lack of theoretical and practical knowledge about such systems [166], and there
    is always

    a problem with the farmers’ lack of awareness for implementing new technologies
    in

    their farms [192], or even hesitance of the farmers to use them [165]. Finally,
    as these

    technologies are still at the infant stage of development, there is also a lack
    of policies

    and regulations [218], as well as ownership and processing issues related to the
    generated

    data [166].

    4.4. Synergies Mentioned in the Literature

    Works that present substantial synergies between technologies are sparse. This
    sub-

    section summarises the review ﬁndings. While data fusion between different sensors
    for

    agriculture has been explored in previous works [225,226], the particularities
    of fusing or

    combining sensory output originating from two or more sources as diverse as IoT,
    UAV,

    and satellites has not been touched upon adequately for agricultural purposes.
    Alvarez-

    Vanhard et al., 2021 [225] gives a thorough review of the literature from 2021
    and before,

    which mentions the synergical use of satellites and UAVs for agriculture, but
    it does not

    mention combinations of IoT and any of the two aforementioned technologies. The
    current

    work attempts to take the reasoning of [225] one step further by focusing on the
    particulari-

    ties of each paper reviewed and dissecting the exact reasons that make the use
    of a synergy

    desirable. These reasons can be traced back to the challenges mentioned in Sections
    4.1–4.3,

    as the complementary use of two or more technologies attempts to mitigate the
    limita-

    tions and challenges each technology faces on its own. Tables 7 and 8 present
    the logic

    permeating each type of synergy encountered during the literature review by contrasting

    its complementary technological traits. Tables 9–11, describe the use cases of
    synergies

    performed in relevant works and characterize them according to the particular
    synergy

    types as deﬁned in Tables 7 and 8.

    Among UAV-Satellite papers, Type 3 and Type 5 synergies are the most common.

    Interestingly, only two papers have utilized the ﬂexibility of the UAV, and only
    two papers

    have utilized its enhanced capacity to create 3D point clouds, while no work combining

    UAV and satellite requires the historical records of past satellite overpasses.

    Among IoT-UAV/Satellite works, Type 8 was the most common, utilizing the proxim-

    ity of IoT measurements to clear up uncertainties in UAV/satellite remote sensing.
    Type 10

    and Type 12 are the next most commonly mentioned synergies. Most Type 10 synergies

    utilise meteorological data in ML models to complement remote sensing predictions,
    while

    Type 12’s use of historical satellite data was quite common in contrast with UAV–Satellite

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    16 of 32

    papers. Type 9 and Type 11 are only encountered once, since real-time ground sensor

    monitoring is still in its infancy as a practice, and attempts to perform orthorectiﬁcation

    through ground measurements are also scarce. Synergy Type 7 constitutes an exception,
    as

    it is commonly encountered across a very large number of scientiﬁc papers, which
    were

    not reviewed, as they were considered outside the scope of the current work.

    that enrich and add to the value of the information

    provided by remote sensors

    ing

    tend their predictions in the temporal scale

    Satellites keep a historical record

    of data

    Not all ground sensors have the ca-

    pacity of constant monitoring

    Synergy Type 12: Satellite data archive can comple-

    ment missing sensors or missing past information

    While synergical use can mitigate certain liabilities and provide solutions, there
    are

    some challenges that are shared by two of the technologies examined or even by
    all

    three. Therefore, such challenges continue to exist when a synergy is attempted.
    Data

    privacy is a prominent concern for all three technologies, which cannot be mitigated
    by

    combining them. Another shared challenge is the large data volumes, which become

    more cumbersome when we have data fused from different sources. This is coupled
    with

    the increase in processing time and costs. In fact, the fusion of data of different
    types

    (sensor data and images of different resolutions) creates further challenges to
    the goal of

    having them efﬁciently integrated. A further challenge of the complementary use
    of the

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    17 of 32

    aformentioned technologies is that farmers need to become acquainted with not
    just one

    but all the technologies that are being combined. Moreover, it should be mentioned
    that

    the lack of current research regarding actual synergies between the three technologies
    is

    both an important impeding factor towards a holistic paradigm involving all three
    and

    a challenge for future research and pilot projects. In fact, in our literature
    review, out of

    the 205 reviewed works, only 24 papers provided synergy use cases. Finally, the
    lack of

    standardization poses further challenges with reference to their complementary
    use. In fact,

    all use cases found by the authors miss any particular standardization procedure,
    which

    could be beneﬁcial for the future of synergical use between technologies.

    This particular work considered which strategy of Variable

    rate N fertilization is more sound by examining a use case

    of two ﬁelds, one with barley and another with wheat.

    By fusing ground measurements using a vis-NIR sensor,

    with satellite NDVI measurements, and historical yield

    measurements, they rasterized the ﬁelds into management

    zones with different fertility classes. Then, they considered

    if they should apply more N to less fertile areas, apply more

    N to more fertile areas, or just apply N uniformly. Their

    results show that the ﬁrst strategy is the strongest.

    5. Discussion

    The value of satellite imagery in PA greatly depends on the application it is
    required

    for, as well as the particularities of the crops and the ﬁeld. Even VHR satellites
    such as

    World View-3 are not suitable for individual plant analysis. While they provide
    a 30 cm

    per pixel spatial resolution on RGB imagery, on MS imagery, their spatial resolution
    is

    about 1.24 m per pixel. Thus, while their RGB imagery resolution is good enough
    for

    distinguishing canopies, the same satellite MS spatial resolution is not enough
    to provide

    adequate data for further analysis of these canopies. Evidently, satellite use
    is limited in

    heterogeneous farms, meaning farms that provide imagery that combines many different

    textures, such as soil, plants, wild weeds, or farming structures. In contrast,
    satellites are

    more useful for crops that cover an area homogeneously, such as cereal crops.
    But even in

    these types of plantations, applications such as wild-weed identiﬁcation and soil
    spectral

    analysis beneﬁt the most from the highest possible spatial resolution. Therefore,
    UAVs

    have an edge in applications of this type or heterogeneous farms. Very-high-deﬁnition

    images from UAVs, on the other hand, may introduce data redundancy, which lowers
    the

    performance of the algorithms used to process the images [117]. Upscaling may
    be necessary

    to a resolution scale, which ensures optimal performance of the algorithm used,
    which is

    another impediment to the UAV standardization of procedures regarding PA. It is
    therefore

    necessary to know the optimal resolution scale for each use case, as different
    combinations

    of algorithms and crops require different optimal resolutions. An added beneﬁt
    is that

    lower resolution requirements allow the UAVs to ﬂy to a higher altitude, thus
    also reducing

    battery expenditure and the time needed for the image-gathering excursion [116].

    It is less probable to obtain usable imagery during rainy weather with a satellite
    than

    it is with a UAV system ([57,74]), as cloud coverage greatly affects satellite
    image quality.

    It might even render satellite images unusable if the coverage is too dense. Diseases
    can

    evolve rapidly, requiring precise and strict monitoring to ensure results, and
    skipping a

    measurement because of cloud coverage might throw off the project completely.
    On the

    opposite end, UAVs, being able to ﬂy at will and being unaffected by cloud coverage,
    have

    a much higher capability for frequent imaging. A satellite’s lower resolution
    does come

    with certain beneﬁts. Wide coverage is a satellite’s inherent advantage, and,
    as there is

    no piloting involved, the homogeneity of data is guaranteed. In contrast, UAVs
    have to

    be piloted carefully, they have to be stable enough to follow their required trajectory,
    and

    they have to maintain the same height over crops. Covering the same area as a
    satellite

    requires more images, more time, an expert pilot, and more processing of the images
    to

    create the ﬁnal mosaics. It is therefore evident that UAVs are optimal for small
    to medium

    farms, where they are not required to cover vast areas for image acquisition.
    Large farms

    are better served by satellite imagery, supposing that they are not very heterogeneous.

    UAVs, being highly modular platforms that come in all shapes and sizes while also

    being able to carry many different sensors, have abundant ﬂexibility but at the
    cost of stan-

    dardization. Sensor calibration is a process that is dependent on the equipment;
    therefore,

    each combination of UAV model and sensor requires its own calibration procedure.
    In

    contrast, satellites do not face such issues, as their calibration is a standardized
    procedure

    that has been taken care of by the platform operators. Therefore, the risk of
    obtaining

    unusable data due to calibration faults is higher in UAVs. Moreover, due to this
    lack of

    standardization, UAV images have a slightly higher processing complexity than
    satellite

    imagery. Still, by having a much higher temporal resolution and by being devices
    that can

    become part of a wider IoT network, UAVs can provide their data faster for processing
    and

    can even utilize edge computing if there is available on-ﬁeld infrastructure.

    Nevertheless, UAVs require a large upfront investment, that includes the cost
    of buying

    the vehicle, as well as the cost of buying its sensory equipment. Following this
    considerable

    investment, the cost of using and maintaining the platform includes recharging
    costs, the

    cost of man hours for processing the images, the cost of man hours for piloting
    the platform,

    and any costs for repairs and spare parts. Satellites, on the other hand, do not
    require the

    large upfront investment, but high spatial resolution satellite images can only
    be acquired

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 1942

    21 of 32

    by paying a hefty price. A further cost is added due to the man hours and skills
    required to

    process the satellite data. Adding to the challenge of buying and setting up a
    UAV platform

    for remote sensing are the bureaucratic difﬁculties of acquiring a licence to
    ﬂy it. In contrast,

    satellite data require almost no bureaucratic hurdle for their acquisition.

    The third PA technology analysed in this review is IoT. This may incorporate any
    type

    of sensor, from soil sensors that measure soil parameters, such as moisture, temperature,

    and the concentration of elements such as carbon and nitrogen, to sensors that
    measure

    water levels in crops for irrigation purposes, to MS sensors that measure vegetation
    indices.

    An IoT device can have any combination of sensors and can be adapted to the particularities

    of the farm under examination. IoT tends to be more expensive than UAVs or satellite

    data, but provides the most noise-free data out of the three technologies. Moreover,
    their

    capacity to capitalize on edge-computing puts them at the forefront of scientiﬁc
    research,

    as this allows real-time monitoring, which is an important future prospect for
    PA. Out

    of the three technologies analyzed, IoT is the only technology that has the capacity
    for

    continuous monitoring. Measurements from ground sensors are used as training and

    evaluation sets for ML algorithms for application in remote sensing, because their
    data are

    the most trustworthy source of measurement regarding soil moisture, concentrations
    of

    various elements in the soil, water plant status, and similar quantities that
    can be measured

    through physical contact or proximal sensing. The calculation of vegetation indices
    through

    ground remote sensors, on the other hand, is a more challenging endeavor. Ground
    remote

    sensing requires many sensors to be placed strategically across the ﬁeld for maximum

    coverage, and even then, only homogeneous crop types can be measured safely. Image

    recognition of canopies or rows of vines in heterogeneous environments is very
    difﬁcult or

    even impossible to achieve when using ground remote sensors because of the angle
    the

    images are taken from.

    IoT systems are susceptible to attacks by malicious third parties, as they always
    require

    a network infrastructure to operate. On the other hand, UAVs usually operate without

    becoming a part of a network. Thus, they are less susceptible to hacking. Satellites,
    as they

    are not operated by the farmer, cannot become victims of hacking attacks. Nevertheless,

    satellite data from a farmer’s ﬁeld can still be used for nefarious purposes,
    similar to data

    extracted from IoT and UAVs.

    Satellites and UAVs are reusable assets, in contrast to cheap ground sensors.
    The

    environmental waste from an IoT system can be an important cause for concern.
    In

    particular, as the dimensions of the under-measurement ﬁeld become larger, so
    does the

    number of sensors required to cover it. It can be safely assumed that, cost-wise
    and

    environmentally, IoT for large ﬁelds is not an optimal choice.

    Complementary use relies on capitalizing on the strengths of one technology while

    complementing its weaknesses with another technology. UAVs can be used to enhance
    the

    spatial resolution of satellite MS data on certain parts of a ﬁeld in order to
    examine that part

    more carefully. UAVs are also sources of excellent training data for ML algorithms
    that will

    then be applied to satellite imagery. Similarly, IoT systems are great producers
    of training

    data, especially for the purposes of irrigation and the measurement of soil parameters.

    LiDAR and thermal sensors on the ground can be used to enhance remotely sensed
    imagery.

    UAVs and IoT can therefore provide precision when satellite information is not
    precise

    enough for the needed application.

    IoT and UAVs can act in synergy in a multitude of ways. The UAV can provide its

    remotely sensed data to complement data gathered by the ground nodes. A UAV can
    itself

    become another node in an IoT system so that its information can be processed
    in tandem

    with the information of the other nodes. UAVs can even help mitigate power expenditure

    in an IoT system, which is an important limitation, by serving as a carrier of
    data from

    sensors to the main station.

    6. Conclusions

    This systematic review summarized the limitations of ground-based, space-borne,
    and

    airborne technologies for PA, as they are presented in recent literature. It also
    pinpointed

    and summarized works that provide useful synergies between these technologies.
    These

    studies, when paralleled with the limitations of each technology, enable certain
    conclusions

    to be drawn, which can be summed up in the following points:

    •

    Satellite is the broadest of the three technologies, providing ample farm coverage
    and

    good image detail. Cost-wise, it is the least risky source of PA data out of the
    three

    technologies, but it is also the slowest to provide usable results.

    •

    UAVs have great ﬂexibility and the capability to provide very speciﬁc information,

    but they are costly when applied to large farms, while also requiring a risky
    upfront

    investment from farmers. Their ability to analyze crops in very ﬁne detail allows
    them

    to deal with specialized problems such as diseases or wild weeds. Still, using
    them is

    far from a standardized procedure, and more research is needed to establish the
    UAVs

    as a deﬁnitive solution.

    •

    IoT provides the most speciﬁc information, as it can be tailored to the particular
    crop

    and farm. Moreover, it takes the smallest amount of time for data processing and
    has

    the unique potential of constant ﬁeld monitoring. Its high specialization comes
    at the

    cost of reduced ﬂexibility and area coverage.

    •

    The review process included reviewing 24 use cases of synergies in the domain
    of

    agriculture between the technologies in question. Open challenges setting the
    ground

    for future research include data privacy issues, large data volumes, data fusion,

    farmers’ acquaintance with the technology, and lack of standardization. Taking
    steps

    toward addressing such challenges could facilitate further synergies and help
    the

    agricultural domain advance toward the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm.

    As things stand, complementary use of the three technologies requires further
    research.

    The number of works that make an effort to combine them is far too small when
    compared

    with the number of works that have come out in PA recently. The future of agriculture

    relies on optimally using all the technological tools currently at our disposal.

    \ is a crucial sector in Morocco, accounting for a \nsignificant portion of the\
    \ country's GDP and employing a large \npercentage of the population. However,\
    \ the sector faces several \nchallenges, including water scarcity, unpredictable\
    \ weather \npatterns, and a lack of access to information and resources [1]. \n\
    Recently, an increasing interest has been observed for \ndeveloping crop recommendation\
    \ systems to address these \nchallenges and improve agricultural productivity\
    \ in the country \n[2]. \nCrop recommendation systems use predictive techniques\
    \ to \nsuggest the most suitable crops for a given location and set of \nconditions.\
    \ These systems rely on data from various sources, \nsuch as satellite imagery,\
    \ weather forecasts, soil analyses, and \nhistorical crop yields, to make accurate\
    \ predictions [3]. By \nproviding farmers with personalized recommendations, crop\
    \ \nrecommendation systems can help them make informed \ndecisions about crop\
    \ selection and improve their yields and \nprofits [4]. \nThe objective of this\
    \ paper is to present a predictive \napproach to improving agricultural productivity\
    \ in Morocco \nthrough crop recommendations. Specifically, we will develop a \n\
    crop \nrecommendation \nsystem \nthat \nutilizes \nprediction \ntechniques to\
    \ suggest the most suitable crops for a given \nlocation and set of conditions.\
    \ \nIn order to achieve this objective, we will initially examine \nthe current\
    \ body of literature related to crop recommendation \nsystems as well as the difficulties\
    \ encountered by the \nagricultural sector in Morocco. After this, we will outline\
    \ the \napproach we employed to construct our system, which \nincluding the dataset,\
    \ prediction techniques, and evaluation \nmetrics. Following this, we will detail\
    \ the outcomes of our \nstudy, including the precision of our forecasts and the\
    \ efficacy \nof our crop recommendation system. Lastly, we will analyze \nthe\
    \ implications of our research on enhancing agricultural \nproductivity in Morocco\
    \ and suggest potential avenues for \nfuture research. \nThe structure of the\
    \ paper is as follows. Firstly, an \nintroduction is provided, followed by a succinct\
    \ AI in precision \nagriculture summary, focusing primarily on Machine Learning\
    \ \n(ML) as a component of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The paper \nalso includes\
    \ a concise literature review that highlights recent \ndevelopments in the field.\
    \ The research methodology is then \npresented, which involves an experimental\
    \ evaluation of our \nresearch using various ML algorithms such as Decision Tree,\
    \ \nNaïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and \nSupport Vector Machine.\
    \ A discussion comes after this section. \nFinally, the key findings of the study\
    \ are summed up as a \nconclusion of this paper. \nII. \nPRECISION FARMING OVERVIEW\
    \ \nPrecision farming is an agricultural management approach \nthat uses technology\
    \ to optimize crop yields and reduce waste. \nIts objective is to provide farmers\
    \ with real-time data and \ninformation on their farms and livestock, in order\
    \ to take \naccurate actions that can result in maximized crop yields and \nlimited\
    \ losses. \nAI helps in analyzing data from various sources and \nmaking informed\
    \ decisions about crop management [5]. ML, a \nsubfield of AI, has proven to be\
    \ particularly useful in precision \nfarming due to its ability to automatically\
    \ learn patterns from \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 14, No. 3, 2023 \n200 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \nlarge datasets and make predictions based on those patterns [6]. \nFig. 1\
    \ presents the key component of precision farming. \nPrecision farming involves\
    \ the use of a range of IoT \nsensors that gather various indicators associated\
    \ with farming \n[7]. These indicators can include various environmental \nparameters\
    \ such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, pH, \ntemperature, humidity, light,\
    \ and weather conditions. Other \nindicators may also relate to livestock, such\
    \ as veterinary well-\nbeing, feed intake, and weight gain. These indicators can\
    \ be \nused to optimize various aspects of crop and livestock \nmanagement, \n\
    including \nirrigation, \nfertilization, \ndisease \nprevention, and pest control\
    \ [8]. \nThe data collected by these sensors is transmitted to the \ntechnical\
    \ staff. Various data analytic methods are then applied \nto interpret and derive\
    \ useful insights from the collected data. \nThe resulting information is exploited\
    \ to take accurate and \ntimely actions. To provide a better understanding, Fig.\
    \ 2 \nillustrates the various stages involved, including the automated \ncollection\
    \ of data and the processing operations by agribots \naccording to the insights\
    \ derived from the processed data. \nOne area where ML has been applied in precision\
    \ farming \nis crop yield prediction. ML algorithms can analyze data from \nsensors,\
    \ such as satellite imagery, weather stations, and soil \nsensors, to make accurate\
    \ predictions about crop yields [9]. For \nexample, a study [10] used ML to predict\
    \ winter wheat yields \nin China based on satellite imagery and weather data.\
    \  \nAnother application of ML in precision farming is crop \ndisease detection.\
    \ By analyzing images of crops, ML \nalgorithms can identify signs of disease\
    \ or stress and alert \nfarmers to take action [11]. For example, a study [12]\
    \ used ML \nto identify cassava disease in Tanzania based on images \ncaptured\
    \ by drones. The authors found that their ML model \nwas able to accurately identify\
    \ diseased plants, even in cases \nwhere the symptoms were not visible to the\
    \ human eye. \n \nFig. 1. Core components of precision agriculture. \n \nFig.\
    \ 2. Overview of the general process involved in precision agriculture. \nML can\
    \ also be used to optimize crop management \ndecisions, such as irrigation and\
    \ fertilization. By analyzing data \non soil moisture, nutrient levels, and weather\
    \ patterns, ML \nalgorithms can suggest the optimal amount of water to apply to\
    \ \na crop [13]. For example, a study by [14] demonstrates that the \nintegration\
    \ of active canopy sensing and machine learning \nimproves the prediction accuracy\
    \ of the corn nitrogen nutrition \nindex by accounting for genetic, environmental,\
    \ and \nmanagement factors. \nIn conclusion, ML has significant potential in precision\
    \ \nfarming due to its ability to analyze large datasets and make \naccurate predictions.\
    \ By applying ML to tasks such as crop \nyield prediction, disease detection,\
    \ and crop management \noptimization, farmers can improve their yields and reduce\
    \ \nwaste. \nIII. \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nNowadays, as ML has been increasingly\
    \ employed in \nprecision agriculture, numerous studies have been conducted \n\
    across various areas of farming. Therefore, to provide a clearer \npicture and\
    \ distinguish this work from others, we present a \nsummary of recent research\

    \ systems and recommendation platforms, using state-\nof-the-art techniques. While\
    \ these approaches have potential, \nthey do not necessarily address the need\
    \ for real solutions that \ncan be implemented in the field at low cost and can\
    \ help \nfarmers and decision-makers optimize their resources and \nmaximize profits.\
    \ \nIt is interesting to note that few studies have focused on this \nissue in\
    \ recent years, with most studies providing only \ntheoretical overviews and practical\
    \ implementations. The \nchallenge is to find a way to make these solutions available\
    \ for \nall, and make them more visible to a larger audience, such as \nfarmers.\
    \ Our study provides a step-by-step explanation of how \nto address these problems\
    \ and offers examples of how to make \nthese technologies available for free.\
    \ \nIV. \nMETHODS AND RESULTS \nA. System Conception \nTo design our crop recommendation\
    \ system, we initiated \nthe first step by preparing a crop recommendation dataset.\
    \ We \nused Moroccan climate, fertilizer and precipitations data [30] \nthen preprocessed\
    \ it in order to make extensive explorations. \nWe worked with a dataset consisting\
    \ of 1800 entries and eight \nvariables. Next, we conducted an exploration of\
    \ the data to \nunderstand its nature. Finally, we used ML techniques counting\
    \ \nNB, DT, RF, SVM, and LR to extract the best features and \nbuild our ML models.\
    \ \nFig. 3 provides a detailed illustration of the steps taken in \ndesigning\

    \ 3. Design process of the crop recommendation system. \nB. Dataset Preparation\
    \ and Feature Selection \nThe crop recommendation dataset we selected comprised\
    \ \nseveral features, including content in soil of Phosphorus (P), \nPotassium\
    \ (K) and Nitrogen (N), as well as soil pH value and \nmoisture, precipitations,\
    \ temperature and plant variety. The \ndata collection consisted of 1800 entries,\
    \ and an overview of \nthe dataset statistics is presented in Table II. \nIn terms\
    \ of the relationship between the input parameters \nand target, we observed that\
    \ certain parameters, such as \nPotassium, phosphorus and Nitrogen exhibit strong\
    \ correlations \nof 0.6. This is a promising sign prior to the commencement of\
    \ \nthe prediction. There were also some phew negative correlation \nvalues between\
    \ the indicators. This shows that the dataset is \nrich in information. \nFrom\
    \ a biological perspective, the P K N levels play a vital \nrole as important\
    \ macro-nutrients that support plant growth. \nPotassium, is responsible for the\
    \ plant’s natural functioning, \nwhile phosphorus aids in the maturation of fruits.\
    \ Nitrogen \ncontributes mainly to the growth of leaves. \nFertilizer containing\
    \ elements such as P K N and can be \ntailored to different crops based on their\
    \ concentrations. These \nnutrients are essential for the growth and productivity\
    \ of crops, \nand using fertilizer can make up for any deficiencies in the soil.\
    \ \nBy understanding the PKN ratios required for optimal plant \ndevelopment,\
    \ farmers can manage fertilization and achieve \nbetter yields [31]. \nOther parameters\
    \ in our data, including temperature, soil \nmoisture and pH, and precipitations\
    \ play important roles in \ncrop selection. The pH value affects the existence\
    \ of vital \nsubstances, while precipitations level is crucial in plant \nsurvival.\
    \ Air temperature impacts photosynthesis, and soil \nmoisture is essential for\
    \ growth, but too much or too little can \nbe detrimental. Our dataset includes\
    \ several crop categories, \nsuch as apples, dates, corn, grape, pepper, orange,\
    \ peach, \npotatoes, onions, tomatoes, olives, and watermelon, that can be \n\
    predicted based on these features. The prediction of these crops \nyields is dependent\
    \ on the parameters mentioned. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    \ we utilized the \nPython programming language. The data preprocessing stage\
    \ \ninvolved importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, \nPandas, Scikit-learn,\
    \ and Matplotlib. \nTo train and test the models, we split the dataset into \n\
    training and testing datasets, with a ratio of 70:30. We then \nemployed five\
    \ ML models (DT, NB, LR, RF, and SVM). \nTo evaluate the accuracy of the models,\
    \ we used precision, \nrecall, F1 and accuracy metrics, which were calculated\
    \ using \nthe following formulas: \n           \n  \n      \n \n(1) \n       \
    \ \n  \n       \n \n(2) \n          \n     \n            \n(3) \n            \
    \  \n                \n                 (4) \nWhere    (true positive) is the\
    \ number of correctly \npredicted positive values,    (false positive) is the\
    \ number of \nfalsely predicted positive values,    (true negative) is the \n\
    number of correctly predicted negative values, and    (false \nnegative) is the\
    \ number of falsely predicted negative values. \nAdditionally, we used k-fold\
    \ cross-validation scores to \nevaluate the effectiveness of the different algorithms\
    \ used in \nthe predictive analysis, which provided a more robust \nassessment\
    \ of the models' performance [32]. \nThese scores helped us evaluate the effectiveness\
    \ of the \ndifferent algorithms used in the predictive analysis. \nV. \nRESULTS\
    \ AND DISCUSSION \nA. Results of Prediction \nThis section presents a discussion\
    \ of the experimental \nresults obtained for the performance of the ML algorithms\
    \ used \nin our study. Table III provides a detailed summary of the \nprecision,\
    \ recall, accuracy, and k-fold cross-validation score \nresults. \nBased on our\
    \ results, the ML algorithms employed in our \nstudy exhibit varying levels of\
    \ predictive capabilities in \ndetermining profitable crop based on inputs. Our\
    \ analysis \nshows that RF has the highest performance in terms of \naccuracy,\
    \ with a score of 97.18%. In comparison, other \nalgorithms such as NB (96.36%),\
    \ LR (95.62%), SVM \n(87.38%), and DT (86.64%) have lower accuracy scores. \n\
    Fig. 4 illustrates a comparison of the accuracy for all ML \nmodels adopted in\
    \ our analysis. \nThe precision value assesses the ratio of accurate positive\
    \ \nlabel predictions, indicates that NB and RF exhibit excellent \nperformance.\
    \ Conversely, DT has the lowest performance in \nthis category. Regarding recall\
    \ value, which assesses the ability \nof the ML models to correctly predict actual\
    \ positives, RF once \nagain outperforms the other models, while SVM and DT have\
    \ \nthe lowest scores. \nRegarding the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of\
    \ \nprecision and recall, RF attains the highest score of 97%, \nfollowed by NB\
    \ at 96%, LR at 96%, SVM at 87%, and DT at \n83%. \nTo estimate the overall performance\
    \ of the models, we used \nK-fold cross-validation with a value of K=10. The results\
    \ \nindicate that RF has the highest 10-fold cross-validation vale, \nwhile DT\
    \ has the lowest performance. Although accuracy \nalone is not a reliable performance\
    \ metric, considering other \nevaluation measures, it is apparent that RF surpasses\
    \ the used \nML techniques in forecasting the most appropriate crop. \nTABLE III.\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nB. Crop Recommendation Solution \nIn our opinion, the\
    \ market for precision agriculture \nsolutions that are available at no cost and\
    \ released under an \nopen-source license is continuing to evolve, and considerable\
    \ \nprogress is needed for these solutions to compete with closed-\nsource solutions.\
    \ However, the involvement of a network of IT \nspecialists and interested parties,\
    \ including farmers, has aided \nexpansion of open-source alternatives. These\
    \ communities can \naddress any issues or doubts related to technology integration\
    \ \nwith ease [33-35]. Bearing this in mind, our main objective \nwas to propose\
    \ and design a crop recommendation system. \nRelying on the performance metrics\
    \ mentioned earlier, RF \ndemonstrated superior performance in comparison to the\
    \ other \nML models we used. Therefore, we plan to employ RF to \npredict the\
    \ optimal crop based on the user's input parameters, \nsuch as P K N, soil moisture\
    \ and pH, temperature, and \nprecipitations. After selecting the best-performing\
    \ model, we \nserialized/saved it Python’s built-in persistence model, namely\
    \ \npickle, for developing of the crop recommendation system. The \nvarious steps\
    \ involved in designing and deploying the crop \nrecommendation system are outlined\
    \ in Fig. 5. \n \nFig. 5. Stages included in creating and launching the crop suggestion\
    \ \nplatform. \nTo create the system, we utilized Flask as a Python micro \nframework\
    \ used in applications development, which enables \nprogrammers to conveniently\
    \ build Application Programming \nInterfaces (APIs) in Python language. To create\
    \ interactive web \npages for users, we used HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)\
    \ \nand designed them using CSS. After that, we implemented the \nplatform Flask\
    \ micro web framework. Fig. 6 depicts the fully \nfunctional recommendation platform\
    \ hosted locally. \nThe working system along with the development \nenvironment\
    \ are available on an uploaded directory online \n[36]. It consists of all code\
    \ files used for the training and \nprediction, as well as the app code of the\
    \ recommendation \nsystem and the frontend source code. \nIn Fig. 6(a), the collected\
    \ field data is entered manually at \nthe Front end. \nIn Fig. 6(b), the Result\
    \ is displayed after processing the \ngiven data through the trained M.L Model.\
    \ \n \n(a) Implemented crop recommendation system. \n \n(b) Implemented crop recommendation\
    \ system. \nFig. 6. Implemented crop recommendation system. \nVI. \nDISCUSSION\
    \ \nAfter evaluating the performance results of the ML model \ntraining, we found\
    \ that RF has the best performance among all \nthe models. Despite the small training\
    \ dataset of only 1800 \nentries, RF still outperforms other models in terms of\
    \ recall, \nprecision, and other performance criteria, apart from accuracy. \n\
    Therefore, we chose RF as the ML technique to use in building \nthe recommendation\
    \ system. \nOnce the required inputs are submitted, the platform \nverifies for\
    \ missing values and if the entries fall within \nacceptable thresholds before\
    \ proceeding. The system then \npredicts the most appropriate crop to plant based\
    \ on the input \nparameters. This enables farmers to make informed decisions \n\
    for higher returns on investment and reduced wastage. This \nenables farmers to\
    \ opt for knowledgeable choices that lead to \nincreased profits and reduced waste.\
    \ \nDuring the development of our crop recommendation \nsystem, we postulated\
    \ that users would utilize pre-existing \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 14, No. 3, 2023 \n204 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nmeteorological data and the abundant IoT farming tools\
    \ that \nare already deployed to obtain necessary information for \nsubmitting\
    \ parameters to our platform. Since our platform is \nweb-based, it is accessible\
    \ from anywhere and from any \ndevice, providing a high level of convenience for\
    \ the users. \nHowever, we acknowledge that the dataset we used for \ndeveloping\
    \ the system is constituted of Moroccan data, and \ncrop growth can vary based\
    \ on the context and circumstances \nof different territories. To provide our\
    \ system to farmers \nglobally, more data from various geographic locations may\
    \ be \nrequired. As our system continues to develop, it can have the \ncapability\
    \ to compile information from various geographical \nterritories, allowing users\
    \ to enter their position along with the \nrelevant data to predict suitable crops\
    \ for planting. This paper \ndisplays the potential of using ML to design smart\
    \ techniques \nat the service of agriculture, and it may set the stage for \n\
    emerging \nstudies to develop predictive platforms \nin \nconjunction with robotic\
    \ technology. \nInvesting in farming is critical for any economy, and \nselecting\
    \ profitable crops is an important task that can \nguarantee the best production.\
    \ Our proposed solution aims to \nhelp farmers select the best crop for their\
    \ land and \nenvironmental context. With further improvements, like \nintegrating\
    \ IoT in automated data collection and using more \nparameters and key indicators\
    \ from different locations, we can \noffer this technology to more farmers, especially\
    \ those who \nwant to implement technology-driven precision farming. \nWhile many\
    \ organizations and startups are designing \nprecision farming solutions, most\
    \ of them are subscription-\nbased with high prices, free and open-source alternatives\
    \ can \nbe accessible for farmers to. It is crucial for farmers to be \nknowledgeable\
    \ about these alternatives that can enable them to \nutilize technology at no\
    \ cost, instead of making significant \nupfront investments. \nVII. CONCLUSION\
    \ AND PERSPECTIVES \nAgriculture is a vital industry that feeds billions of people\
    \ \nworldwide, and the use of technology has transformed \ntraditional farming\
    \ practices, resulting in improved yields and a \nhigher quality harvest while\
    \ reducing manual labor. Precision \nfarming, powered by AI, is becoming increasingly\
    \ popular due \nto its ability to collect field data and to assist farmers in\
    \ taking \ninformed actions to manage their cultivated lands. \nThis study presents\
    \ a web-based ML-driven crop \nrecommendation system to assist users choose the\
    \ most \nsuitable crops to plant based on local environmental conditions. \nAlthough\
    \ there are many commercial solutions available, \nalternatives also exist at\
    \ freely and at no coast. \nThe study demonstrates the combination of ML and \n\
    precision agriculture and outlines the architecture of a web-\nbased platform.\
    \ The platform could be improved by adding \nreal-time monitoring capabilities\
    \ by interfacing with existing \ndata aggregation platforms from sensors and IoT.\
    \ This would \nresult in a more accurate and suitable prediction framework, \n\
    making precision farming more accessible to farmers \nworldwide, ultimately helping\
    \ to address the challenges of \nfeeding the global population. \nREFERENCES \n\

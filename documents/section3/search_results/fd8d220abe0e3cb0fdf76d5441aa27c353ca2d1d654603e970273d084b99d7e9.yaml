    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,

    255 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and

    42 percent. 5 Conclusion Precision agriculture depends on being able to predict
    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented
    an Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that

    Abstract Contrary to popular belief, agriculture is becoming more data-driven
    with artificial intelligence and Internet-of-Things (IoT) playing crucial roles.

    Article Open access 02 December 2022 Introduction The world''s population is heavily
    dependent on agriculture for food. Water is a crucial component of agriculture.
    The yields of crops like fruits, rice, wheat, and other staples with which a sizable
    portion of the world''s population survives depend significantly on the availability
    and management of water. While 85% of fresh water is used in agriculture, such
    a vital gift of the nature is becoming increasingly scarce1,2. A sizable population
    depends on agriculture in densely populated nations like India and China, where
    it generates the majority of the country''s income3. Contrary to popular belief,
    the agriculture sector is developing and becoming more data-driven, precise, and
    intelligent than ever. The rapid developments of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    and Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based technology have shifted from statistical to
    quantitative methodologies in virtually every industry, including \"smart agriculture\".
    Such drastic changes are fundamentally altering conventional farming methods and
    creating new opportunities alongside a number of challenges. Furthermore, there
    are enough opportunities to develop mechanisms for creating intelligent decision
    support and process control systems for better plant and fruit health monitoring,
    automatization of water sprinkling, resource conservation etc. In particular,
    it is important to investigate performance gains that can be derived by implementing
    popular, robust and optimized DL networks along with sensors, computer vision
    and regression techniques and IoT setups in an integrated mechanism. Given the
    foregoing, significant efforts have been made throughout the years to utilize
    modern advancements in AI and IoT to increase the productivity and efficiency
    of the agriculture sector4,5,6. In recent years, IoT, sensors, and machine learning
    (ML) / deep learning (DL) have been utilized extensively in the agriculture sector,
    particularly with regard to monitoring, process control, and management5,6. In
    order to create trustworthy decision support systems (DSS), IoT and ML merge sensor
    inputs7,8. These techniques have made it possible to use data-driven strategies
    to boost agricultural produce yields. In order to create robust DSS, ML platforms
    use data collected by sensors as part of IoT setups9,10. In particular, ML techniques
    combine historical facts with the current environment to produce precise forecasts
    and generate crucial process control decisions11. Both wired and wireless sensors
    are used in agriculture for a variety of tasks, including weather monitoring,
    self-watering, and other related tasks including monitoring the health of plants
    and fruits12,13,14. Such prototype hardware-software frameworks enable the fusing
    of the relevant technologies through which we develop better understanding regarding
    the assimilation of sensors, data collection and analysis, the creation of a testing
    environments for sensor fusion, and decision making15,16,17. Such a system designed
    for agricultural applications must successfully combine sensors in IoT packs and
    AI aids so as to increase efficiency 18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Developing a fusion
    of sensors for designing an agriculture management system for fruit cultivation
    presents a number of difficulties, including: Interface of sensors and devices
    or hardware components together into a common platform. Transmit and receive real-time
    information through Wi-Fi modules and obtain data analysis. Implement ML/DL algorithms
    for decision support including rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition.
    Control and monitor the integrated management system in real time. The present
    work focuses on the design of a precision agriculture setup with stress on the
    adoption of sensors, IoT, and ML to regulate water flow and process management
    so as to maximize crop yield. The description included here covers the design
    of blocks and sub-blocks related to methods for obtaining real-time data from
    different field sensors, displaying and providing analysis using an Android application,
    irrigation process control through an automated mechanism, rainfall prediction,
    and fruit health monitoring using certain ML techniques. A range of sensors, such
    as soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, and air quality sensors,
    are combined as an IoT set-up. It drives an AI aided decision support system that
    enables the capture and monitoring of fruit health and the environment of the
    cultivation ground. Further, the system has the ability to utilize the decisions
    derived by the AI aided set-up for the control of an irrigation system which is
    used as part of an agriculture management arrangement. Sensors are synchronized
    using a microcontroller embedded system, and each dataset obtained from the sensors
    is sent wirelessly by an IoT device controller to a cloud resident AI tool configured
    for decision support and monitoring using an Android application. The key aspect
    of the work is the design and configuration of several ML algorithms, namely CatBoost,
    Gaussian NB, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with long short-term
    memory (LSTM) layer for rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring and recognition
    using CNN with soft-max layer, CNN with Adam Optimizer and PTM based DL classifiers.
    These provide area under the curve (AUC) scores as well as accuracy values under
    field conditions, and provide sufficient ground for the formulation of an integrated
    agriculture assistant for cultivation and monitoring of certain types of fruits.
    Further, we have designed a combined rainfall predictor and fruit health recognizer
    using a CNN + LSTM and a multi-head self-attention mechanism (Section “Combined
    CNN+ LSTM +attention layer based rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition
    system”) which has lesser memory requirement, is more accurate and requires low
    computation time. Experimental results show that the approach is reliable and
    robust, and the services are hosted using a web portal with a user-friendly interface.
    Related works A number of technologies have already been reported for the effective
    use of water using a range of methods and application of precisions aids in agriculture.
    A system reported in1 comprises a distributed wireless sensor network with temperature
    and soil moisture sensors installed in crop fields. The Zigbee protocol is used
    to manage sensor data as part of an automated drip irrigation system2. The pH
    and nitrogen levels in the soil are often checked. By monitoring the amount of
    ground moisture, the authors in3 reported the design of a mechanism that can assist
    an automated watering system. The temperature and moisture levels of the plants
    are measured by the sensors for moisture and water content4. The moisture sensor
    provides the Raspberry Pi to turn on the water pump and provide the plant with
    water if the moisture level is determined to be lower than the required level5.
    An IoT based smart irrigation system has been presented in6 which reports that
    the proposed system can regulate soil moisture levels according to requirements
    and that users may remotely monitor, operate, and gather data through an online
    website. A range of sensors are available for use in agriculture7. In8, the authors
    report the design of a technology that enables the automated, low-cost management
    of an indoor farm. For the Indian context9, suggests using Multiple Linear Regression
    (MLR) to estimate rainfall. Mean error and root mean square error (RMSE) techniques
    are used in the design of a model reported in10. The model forecasts the rainfall
    based on the data after the results are examined to determine the inter-annual
    variability and tested against the experimental yearly variance of rainfall. Rainfall
    models10, optimal microcontrollers11, IoT based control system12 and greenhouse
    monitoring13, micro-service frontend14, etc. are intricately related to precision
    farming. Some of the recent work25,26,27,28 have provided diverse approaches towards
    fruit-health monitoring and use of IoT and ML approaches for a range of decision
    making and support applications. Theoretical background Here, we discuss the theoretical
    aspects of different sensors, ML methods and related systems. Sensors First, we
    discuss about the sensors. The MQ135 sensor7,8 is a low-cost device and suitable
    for application in areas that deal with air quality and for detecting different
    types of gasses present in the air. MQ 135 sensor follows a sensitivity curve
    as shown in Fig. 1. It is a log–log graph and shows plot for multiple gases. The
    x-axis is the detected concentration of the gas in PPM and the y-axis is the RS/R0
    ratio. The equation of a straight line in two-point form is $$y-{y}_{1}=\\frac{{y}_{2}-{y}_{1}}{{x}_{2}-{x}_{1}}\\left(x-{x}_{1}\\right)$$
    (1) where (x1, y1) are the co-ordinates of the first point and (x2, y2) are the
    co-ordinates of the second point in the rectangular co-ordinate plane. Figure
    1 This Sensitivity curve of MQ 135 sensor. Full size image Let, y1 = 1.122, x1 = 10,
    y2 = 0.447 and x2 = 100. Therefore, from the sensitivity curve of MQ 135 sensor
    for acetone, the concentration in PPM for acetone is $${PPM}_{acetone}=159.6-133.33\\frac{{R}_{S}}{{R}_{0}}$$
    (2) where R0 is the resistance of the sensor in clean air and RS is the resistance
    of the sensor in a gas (acetone). Another sensor used is the DHT11 sensor. It
    is used to obtain the temperature and humidity values8,9 as our proposed system
    is designed to work in hot and humid conditions. The soil moisture sensor helps
    in moisture sensing by measuring the water content in the soil. The sensor has
    advantages like anti-rusting property and has a long power life. Convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of DL
    models specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images
    and videos. These are inspired by the processing approach of the mammalian cortex21.
    They have revolutionized the field of computer vision and are widely used for
    various tasks, including image classification, object detection, image generation,
    and more. Here''s a brief overview of CNNs and their advantages: Architecture
    Convolutional Layers: CNNs use convolutional layers that apply learnable filters
    to input data, allowing them to automatically extract hierarchical features from
    the input images21. Pooling Layers: These layers down sample feature maps, reducing
    the spatial dimensions while retaining important information21. Fully Connected
    Layers: After feature extraction, CNNs often include fully connected layers for
    making predictions or decisions based on the learned features21. Advantages of
    CNNs Hierarchical Feature Learning: CNNs automatically learn features at different
    levels of abstraction. Lower layers capture basic features like edges and textures,
    while higher layers capture complex patterns and objects. This hierarchical feature
    learning is crucial for tasks like object recognition21. Spatial Hierarchy: CNNs
    respect the spatial hierarchy of data. Convolutional and pooling layers maintain
    the spatial relationships within an image, which is essential for tasks like object
    localization21. Parameter Sharing: CNNs use weight sharing through convolutional
    kernels. This reduces the number of parameters in the network, making it computationally
    efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with limited
    training data. Translation Invariance: CNNs are naturally invariant to translations
    in the input data. This means they can recognize patterns or objects in different
    parts of the image, making them robust to position variations. Adaptability: CNNs
    can be adapted for various tasks with minor architectural changes. Transfer learning
    allows pre-trained CNNs (e.g., on ImageNet) to be fine-tuned for new tasks, saving
    training time and data requirements. State-of-the-Art Performance: CNNs have achieved
    state-of-the-art performance in numerous computer vision tasks, including image
    classification, object detection, facial recognition, and more. They have been
    applied successfully in diverse domains, including healthcare, autonomous driving,
    and entertainment. Hardware Acceleration: There are specialized hardware accelerators,
    like GPUs and TPUs, optimized for training and deploying CNNs, making them practical
    for real-world applications. Algorithms for rainfall prediction ML/DL approaches
    are robust, noise tolerant, adaptive and provide automated decision support (Fig.
    2). A few selected ML algorithms are configured for the present task in view of
    the fast nature of processing and low demands for computational resources. Figure
    2 A typical machine learning process. Full size image In the subsequent subsections,
    all of the ML algorithms that are used in the work configured to carry out the
    tasks of rainfall prediction (CatBoost classifier, Random Forest classifier, Gaussian
    NB classifier, CNN + LSTM) are briefly discussed. CatBoost classifier CatBoost,
    commonly known as categorical boosting, is a free and open-source boosting toolkit
    used for a variety of tasks, including regression and classification. Figure 3
    displays the various applications of boosted trees for working with categorical
    variables14,15,21. Unlike other gradient boosting methods (which require numeric
    input), Cat-boost may handle category features. Cat-Boost uses ordered statistics
    about the goal. As a result, more generic models can be created with less overfitting
    and less significant hyper parameter adjustments. It''s easy to use and works
    with a wide variety of Python and R packages. CatBoost has been found to have
    the lowest log-loss value for test data on common ML datasets when compared to
    other boosting libraries like XGBoost and LightGBM. Figure 3 Architecture of CatBoost
    Classifier. Full size image Random forest classifier An example of supervised
    learning may be seen in the Random Forest Classifier (Fig. 4), which can be found
    in16,21. It is applicable to ML problems involving regression as well as classification
    and can be utilised for both. In order to achieve more accurate results when making
    predictions based on a specific dataset, the Random Forest Classifier makes use
    of a number of decision trees that are applied to distinct subsets of the input
    dataset. As the number of trees in the forest grows, there is a corresponding
    reduction in the amount of overfitting that occurs. When compared to other algorithms,
    its training time is significantly less16. Mean square error (MSE) is essential
    for performing regression and it is expressed as $$\\mathrm{MSE}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}}\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\left[{\\left({\\mathrm{f}}_{\\mathrm{i}}-{\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)}^{2}\\right]$$
    (3) where, N is the number of all the data points, fi is the value returned by
    the model and yi is the model returned by the actual data points i. For classification-based
    problems, the standard expression used is Figure 4 Architecture of Random Forest
    classifier. Full size image $${\\mathrm{G}}_{\\mathrm{ini}}=1-\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{C}}\\left[{\\left({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)}^{2}\\right]$$
    (4) Gini index is calculated by subtracting the sum of the squared probabilities
    of each class from one. Gaussian naive bayes (NB) classifier A unique variety
    of NB algorithm is the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm21. When the dimensionality
    is high, it has a high level of utility. Even with little training data, it can
    function17 effectively. The Gaussian''s equation for NB $${\\mathrm{P}}\\left({\\mathrm{x}}_{\\mathrm{i}}|{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2{\\pi}
    {\\upsigma }_{\\mathrm{y}}^{2}}}{\\mathrm{exp}}\\left[\\frac{-{\\left({\\mathrm{x}}_{\\mathrm{i}}-{\\upmu
    }_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)}^{2}}{2{\\upsigma }_{\\mathrm{y}}^{2}}\\right]$$ (5) where
    P is the Probability function, σy2 is the variance and µy is the mean of the Gaussian
    random variable y. Architecture of Gaussian NB classifier is presented in Fig.
    5. Figure 5 Architecture of Gaussian NB classifier. Full size image CNN + LSTM-based
    classifier In particular, it is important to investigate performance gains that
    can be achieved by implementing popular DL networks along with computer vision
    techniques and IoT setups in an integrated strategy. Better performance, especially
    with real-time inputs, is anticipated for DL structures that can handle spatial
    and temporal changes in samples. The spatial information of samples, especially
    those from visual inputs, can be reliably captured by CNN-based structures, but
    features with time-varying characteristics are difficult to handle21. This is
    especially pertinent with rainfall prediction. Recurrent structures like the LSTM
    cells are thought to be effective for temporal properties21. Additionally, integrated
    and AI-assisted frameworks with the capacity to extract spatial and temporal variations
    when used for rainfall prediction on continuously captured on-field sensor data
    have relevance not only for the farming community but also for ecological conservation.
    Hence, we have used a hybrid structure of CNN (Fig. 6) and LSTM for rainfall prediction
    using sensor fed data. Figure 6 Architecture of CNN used for fruit health monitoring.
    Full size image Algorithms for fruit health recognition In this subsection, all
    of the ML techniques are discussed that are used in the fruit health recognition
    model. For fruit health monitoring and recognition, we have used CNN + Softmax,
    Adam Optimizer, ResNet50 and GoogleNet. CNN with softmax classifier layer Deep
    learning neural networks like CNN (Fig. 6), are frequently used to interpret structured
    arrays especially while capturing patterns from input images21. CNN contains several
    layers, each of which is capable of recognising intricate forms and details. Here,
    maxpooling 2D and Conv 2D are used. A two-dimensional filter is slid over each
    channel during a maxpooling process, covering any features that are present there.
    Conv 2D is a two-dimensional convolutional layer which helps in creating a kernel
    that is wind with layer input which helps to produce tensor of output, in other
    words, the number of filters that convolutional layers will learn from18. At the
    end, the CNN is terminated by a softmax layer which performs the classification.
    Adam optimizer with CNN Adam Optimizer, often referred to as Adaptive Moment Estimation,
    is a method for gradient descent. It is a very useful and efficient algorithm
    that uses minimal memory. It essentially mixes Gradient Descent with Momentum
    and the Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSP) technique18. The gradient descent
    algorithm is accelerated by the momentum algorithm using the gradients'' exponentially
    weighted average. RMSP, which employs the exponential moving average, improves
    AdaGrad. The two methods discussed above are combined by Adam Optimizer to inherit
    the advantages and provide a more potent optimised gradient descent when combined
    with CNN. PTMs We have also used PTMs ResNet50 and GoogleNet21 for fruit health
    recognition which provide better insight regarding the efficacy of DL based structures
    for design of smart agriculture assistant. Methodology In this section, we discuss
    the methodology of the design of the system. The description includes the design
    of the integrated IoT system, deal time database design, development of an Android
    app, design of rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring systems, full-stack
    web development and the formulation of a combined CNN + LSTM + Attention Layer
    based rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition system. Each of the blocks
    are designed separately, tested and integrated. Further, the integrated system
    is validated and tested extensively to determine the performance limits. In the
    following sub-sections, each of the blocks are discussed with all relevant details.
    Design of an integrated IoT system Figure 7 depicts the system model, which includes
    both manual control of the system via a mobile device and the use of various sensors
    including decision support as part of an automated farming assistance system.
    NodeMCU, various sensors, including soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity
    sensors, and air quality sensors, LEDs, DC water pumps, and motor drivers make
    up the hardware. For data collection, sensors are inserted into a variety of locations
    in the field. The soil moisture sensor determines the volumetric water content
    of the soil by using some of the soil''s properties, such as electrical resistance
    and dielectric constants. Two probes are put into the soil to make up the device.
    The temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) are a multipurpose sensor that simultaneously
    reports the temperature and relative humidity. The air quality sensor (MQ 135)
    measures air quality in parts per million (PPM), making it perfect for detecting
    NH3, NOx, alcohol, benzene, smoking, CO2, and other substances. Organic solvent
    acetone has an impact on soil processes. Different agricultural and ornamental
    plants are adversely affected by acetone, which also reduces their size and damages
    their membranes. NodeMCU gathers real-time environmental inputs from various sensors
    and combine it, improving the system''s data logging and aiding the AI based automation
    strategy. The farmer needs the access to real-time data collected by various sensors
    and shall be able to take control of the motors as needed using the android application.
    LEDs are used to show whether the sensors are functioning. A Red LED placed close
    to the sensor will flash to show the system is malfunctioning if a certain sensor
    cannot read data or if there is a connectivity problem. Additionally, we can determine
    the sensor''s location based on where the LED illuminates. Figure 7 Block diagram
    of the proposed IoT system. Full size image Figure 8 depicts the proposed system''s
    flowchart along with the necessary combinations of various blocks. The WiFi module
    is first set up during development, and then our program tests to see if the sensors
    are working properly. If there is a connection issue or if the sensor is unable
    to read the data, the Red LED will indicate. Whether or not everything is functional
    will be shown by the green LED. The sensors'' data will subsequently be gathered
    and transmitted to the mobile app and Firebase database. The pump status that
    the program obtains from the app and database can be compared. If the observed
    pump status is 1, the pump will be on, and if it is 0, the pump will be off. Algorithm
    1 summarizes the process logic. Figure 8 Flow chart of the proposed IoT system.
    Full size image Algorithm 1 Working of the proposed approach Full size image Real-time
    database designing On the Google Firebase platform, a database is built to collect
    real-time data (Fig. 9). Every connected client receives a real-time synchronization
    signal of data that is stored as JSON (Fig. 10). To create a Google Firebase account,
    users must sign in with their email addresses. Following sign-in, one Firebase
    account is created in private mode. Before it can be connected, the NodeMCU board
    must change from private to public mode by altering a property. The second stage
    is where you can find the fingerprint address of the website. The address should
    be in the \"httpclient.c\" file of the NodeMCU library. The Firebase host address
    on the ESP8266 should be set to the IP address of the Firebase account. Figure

    image Development of android app An Android application is developed to monitor
    the real-time data and control the irrigation system. The Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology (MIT) now manages MIT App Inventor, a web application integrated
    development environment that was first made available by Google. This open-source
    web application is used to establish a real-time data monitoring program (Fig.
    11). The Google Firebase platform is accessed by this app using the Firebase IP
    address and API Key. By entering these criteria in the mobile app development
    dashboard, all pertinent components (such as buttons, labels, fire-based, etc.)
    are used in the design of the app interface. When a mobile app is generated, an
    Android device scans its QR code in the APK file to install it. Figure 11 Architecture
    of the Android app development in MIT App Inventor. Full size image Rainfall prediction
    The goal of the rainfall prediction model (Fig. 12) is to preserve water by using
    ML to accurately forecast rainfall, prepare for contingencies, manage irrigation
    facilities and use the rainwater if water supplies are scarce. The forecast for
    the rainfall is based on a weather dataset from Kaggle. Once the data has been
    read into Jupyter Notebook, missing values for all categorical and numerical variables
    are handled using level encoding, median, get dummies, and random imputation.
    Outliers are also eliminated from the data box plot. The categorical variables
    \"Rain Tomorrow\" and \"Date\" are selected for training and testing after data
    analysis. Several methods, including CatBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier,
    Gaussian NB, and CNN + LSTM network, are used to calculate the AUC and accuracy
    score. The trained networks are fed with sensor data to provide relevant real-time
    responses. Figure 12 Block diagram of rainfall prediction model. Full size image
    A web resident functionality provides indication of weather condition and rain
    forecast of a locality. The \"Predictor Section,\" provides the rainfall forecasting.
    The user can enter several input factors for a certain day that are necessary
    for determining whether it will rain or not. Date, highest and lowest temperatures,
    evaporation, sunshine, wind gust speed, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud
    at specific time are some of the input factors. The user must select the \"Predict\"
    option after entering the required parameters (Table 1) in order to forecast the
    amount of precipitation. Table 1 Parameters used in rainfall prediction model.
    Full size table Fruit health recognition Fruit health recognition system (Fig.
    13) is designed with a view to distinguish fresh fruits from rotten fruits. The
    overall productivity and profitability would suffer if rotten fruits are stored
    along with the fresh fruits as the rotten ones will damage the fresh ones. Fruit
    recognition system is useful in mitigating this issue. Figure 13 Block diagram
    of fruit health recognition model. Full size image Here in this model, three different
    fruits are used: Bananas, Apples and Oranges. Rotten and fresh images for all
    three are collected (Fig. 14). For each class there are at least three different
    varieties in shape and two in colour. The size of the database is 4200 images
    of which 50% are used for training and the remaining for validation and training.
    Further, two illumination and three resolution captures are added which augmented
    the data size significantly. Figure 14 Portion of the sample images taken for
    training, validation and testing of fruit health recognition model. Full size
    image The paper contains the preprocessing steps involving standardization, normalization,
    and rescaling of the images regarding the novelty of the work. Normalization is
    applied here to scale the pixel values of the images to a common range, typically
    between 0 and 1. This helps ensure that the model trains effectively without being
    influenced by the varying pixel value scales in different images. It is necessary
    to establish a benchmark standard for designing and testing the complete system
    based on AI techniques. One the system is validated, the normalization process
    is not required. We have calculated the mean and standard deviation of pixel values
    across the entire dataset and we have used these statistics to normalize each
    image. The formula for normalization is $${\\text{Normalization}} = \\left( {{\\text{Pixel
    Value}} - {\\text{Mean}}} \\right)/{\\text{Standard Deviation}}$$ (6) After normalization
    the pixel values are in a consistent range, reducing the likelihood of vanishing
    or exploding gradients during training. Also the model can learn faster and generalize
    better. The impact of rescaling involves resizing the images to a common and manageable
    size. It''s essential for models that require fixed input dimensions, such as
    CNNs. For the procedure of rescaling we have resized each image to a specified
    target size, e.g., 300 × 300 pixels. When resizing, we have maintained the aspect
    ratio to avoid distortion. The benefits of rescaling ensures that all images have
    the same dimensions, making them compatible with models like CNNs and also reduces
    computational complexity and memory requirements, especially for deep learning
    models. In order to increase the number of images on the dataset, data augmentation
    on the existing images is performed. In the Jupyter Notebook, various modules
    such as TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Pyplot and Seaborn are uploaded. Dataset
    is divided into training and testing dataset. Maxpooling 2D, Conv 2D and Adam
    optimizer are implemented as part of the popular CNN structure. Accuracy and validation
    scores of the model are obtained and a graph is plotted between training and validation
    accuracy and losses. Table 2 summarizes the different parameters used in the design
    of the fruit health recognition system. A webpage is deployed that provides an
    interface to the user for fruit health recognition, from where the prediction
    regarding the condition of the fruit is done. We have used TensorFlow as the deep
    learning framework for building and training our fruit health recognition model.
    Table 2 Parameters used in fruit health recognition model. Full size table The
    parameter selection of the training and dataset are based on the following considerations:
    Deep learning framework—TensorFlow Image_Size = 300 × 300 The images in our dataset
    have been resized to 300 × 300 pixels to fulfill the requirements of training
    the AI system. Batch_Size = 32 During training, the model processes data in batches,
    with each batch containing 32 images. Channels = 3 (RGB) The images in our dataset
    are in RGB format, with each image having three color channels (Red, Green, and
    Blue). Epochs = 35, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 35 number of passes are used We have
    specified a range of epochs for training the model. Each epoch represents one
    pass through the entire training dataset. It appears that our plan to train the
    model for different numbers of epochs to assess its performance. Data size = 4500
    images augmented with two illuminations and three resolutions The dataset consists
    of 4,500 images. Additionally, data augmentation techniques have been applied,
    including variations in illumination and three different resolutions. Data augmentation
    is a valuable technique for increasing the diversity of the training data. Gaussian
    NB classifier However, in the context of deep learning and image recognition,
    deep neural networks, particularly CNNs, are typically used instead of Gaussian
    NB. CNNs are better suited for image-based classification tasks21. Size of the
    training dataset = 50% Half (50%) of the dataset is allocated for training the
    model. This is a common practice, as it allows the model to learn from a substantial
    portion of the data. Size of the validation dataset = 25% A quarter (25%) of the
    dataset is allocated for validation. The validation dataset is used to assess
    the model''s performance during training and to tune hyper parameters. With these
    parameters, we have proceeded with training the fruit health recognition model
    using TensorFlow. However, the use of CNNs instead of Gaussian NB is necessitated
    for the requirements of better performance in case fruit health classification
    tasks. Additionally, monitoring the model''s performance on the validation set
    during training is used to make informed decisions about model architecture and
    hyper parameter tuning. The parameters used in fruit health recognition model
    is given in Table 2. Full-stack web development For the proposed work, three full-stack
    websites are developed that includes all the aspects of the work. Technologies
    employed for the web development include: For Front-End—HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    etc. For Back-End – Flask. Agricultural management system website The main website
    is created with the title ‘Agricultural Management System’. A navigation bar is
    created with different contents from where user can navigate to the different
    sections of the website like “About”, “Services” that are offered, “Contact” to
    the Developers etc. The most important section “Services” consists of different
    features like Weather Forecasting, Fruit Health Recognition, APK for real-time
    data monitoring and irrigation, online education platform etc. The farming-based
    online education platform, which is presently under development, requires users
    to sign up and pay to enroll. The main website is linked to two other websites:
    Rainfall Prediction and Fruit Recognition. The user will be redirected to the
    appropriate website when they select the option for weather forecasting or fruit
    health recognition. Rainfall prediction website A website is created with the
    title ‘Rainfall Predictor’ using HTML, CSS (front-end) and Flask (back-end). From
    the main website, the Rainfall Predictor website can be accessed directly by clicking
    “Weather Forecasting option”. A navigation bar is created with different contents
    from where user can navigate to the different sections of the website like “Home”,
    “About Rainfall Predictor”, “Dashboard”, “Developers” and the “Predictor” section
    from where the actual prediction is done. The webpage contains a dashboard which
    provides graphical representation of the parameters. The user can contact to the
    developers by navigating into the Developer section. Fruit recognition web service
    A web service is created with the title ‘Fruit Recognition’ using HTML, CSS (front-end)
    and Flask (back-end). From the main website, the fruit recognition website can
    be accessed directly by clicking “Fruit Health”. A navigation bar is created with
    different contents from where user can navigate to the different sections of the
    website like “Home”, “About” the website, “Contact” and the “Predictor” section
    from where the actual prediction is done. The main feature is the ‘Prediction
    Section’ from where the actual prediction regarding the condition of the fruit
    is determined. The user in order to identify the condition of the fruit has to
    go to the prediction section in the navigation bar from where images of the fruits
    present in the directory are selected and after selecting the images the user
    has to click the submit button and the result is displayed featuring the condition
    of the fruits (fresh or rotten) as well as the confidence percentage. The user
    can also contact to the developers regarding any query or issue by switching to
    the “Contact” section in the navigation bar. Combined CNN + LSTM + attention layer
    based rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition system The above methods
    discussed provide the opportunity to explore the performance improvements that
    may be achieved by combining the CNN, LSTM and a multi head (MA) self-attention
    (SA) mechanism (Figs. 15, 16) in a composite framework (Fig. 15) for both forecast
    of rain and discrimination of fruit health. The mix of CNN, LSTM, and the SA mechanisms
    emerges out to be effective at discrimination tasks in a variety of areas29,30,31
    that include natural language processing, computer vision, speech processing,
    etc. Let''s look at how each part of the system contributes to the effectiveness
    of the whole framework. Figure 15 Cloud resident composite CNN + LSTM + attention
    mechanism for rainfall prediction and fruit health recognition. Full size image
    Figure 16 Multi head sectoral attention mechanism. Full size image The CNNs are
    utilized extensively for many tasks including the processing of images and texts.
    In the field of computer vision, CNNs are particularly useful at capturing hierarchical
    representations and small spatial patterns. They are made up of convolutional
    layers, which are followed by pooling layers, and they aid in the process of extracting
    useful characteristics from incoming data. CNNs are good at distinguishing between
    visual or sequential patterns, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as
    the classification of images and the identification of objects21. The LSTM networks
    are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that perform well in the processing
    of sequential data, such as natural language sentences or time series. By combining
    a memory cell with input, forget, and output gates, LSTMs are able to accurately
    represent long-term dependence. This is made possible by the memory cell. Because
    of this architecture, LSTMs are able to remember information over time or forget
    it over time, which enables them to effectively handle sequential patterns that
    occur over a wide range of time scales. LSTMs are very helpful for activities
    such as analysing sentiments, translating languages, predicting time varying data
    and events, recognizing voices etc.21. The SA mechanism, often referred to as
    the transformer architecture, has received a great deal of interest in recent
    years for its application in a variety of tasks that require special focus on
    specific areas of input patterns. The model is able to listen to different parts
    of the input sequence thanks to the self-attention capability, which also allows
    it to capture the dependencies that exist between words or tokens21. Calculating
    attention weights between all possible pairings of places in the input sequence,
    then computing a weighted sum of those attention weights to produce a context
    vector for each position, is what this function does. Because of this technique,
    the model is able to concentrate on the parts of the sequence that are the most
    important, which results in improved discrimination and an effective capturing
    of long-range relationships. The combined model is able to take advantage of the
    benefits that are offered by each component namely CNN, LSTM, and Self-Attention
    processes. For instance, in an image classification challenge, the model might
    utilize the advantages of the CNN to extract local features and patterns from
    pattern embeddings, LSTMs to capture the sequential dependencies, and Self-Attention
    to attend to key sections of the sequence while taking into consideration the
    overall context of the problem. By utilising both the local and the global information
    that is contained within the input data, this combination enables the model to
    efficiently differentiate between the many groups or categories that are there.
    As shown in Fig. 16, for the proposed approach has provision for using sensor
    data and image inputs. For the sensor data, there are actual and delayed feeds
    to retain the temporal context. Next, a block of 1D- convolutional (8 no.s) fed
    by 3 × 3 masks an dlinked to batach normalization (BN), rectified linear unit
    (ReLU) and max pooling (MPool) feeds another such block.It is followed by an attention
    layer (detailed layout Fig. 17) which drives another 1D conv + BN + ReLU + LSTM
    layers which dirve a MH-SA and a LSTM layer. This is followed by fully connected
    (FC) layers and ends at softmax block. For the image imputs, two blocks of 2D
    conv (16 with 3 × 3 masks) + BN + ReLU + MPool drives a FC layer which after a
    few more FC blocks ends in a softmax layer. Figure 17 Architecture of the proposed
    agricultural management system. Full size image Experimental set-up The experimental
    set-up is formed by the IoT and ML methods as part of an agriculture farm management
    system (Fig. 17). The system is designed using NodeMCU and cloud computing and
    provides assistance to the farmers in monitoring soil moisture, air quality, humidity,
    and temperature as well as helps in predicting rainfall and fruit health conditions.
    As already mentioned, the sensors are connected to the same NodeMCU platform (ESP
    8266) and the data gathered from sensors are stored in a database in real-time.
    The ESP 8266 is connected to a nearby Wi-Fi network in order to establish a connection
    with the database''s web server. The data can be downloaded from the real-time
    database and shown on the Android mobile app. MIT App Inventor is used to create
    the Android application. Depending on the user input through the pump controller,
    the app can use Boolean data (0 or 1) to convey the pump control status to the
    real-time database. The NodeMCU sends the command to the motor driver in order
    to regulate the irrigation process by retrieving the Boolean data from a real-time
    database. From Kaggle, a weather dataset is obtained and examined. In order to
    clean up the dataset and increase its value, the numerical, continuous, and categorical
    variables are separated, and each variable is then subjected to analysis. Following
    that, box-plot graphs are generated to exclude outliers and provide a visual representation
    of the probability distribution of the data. Popular algorithms—CatBoost, Gaussian
    NB, and Random Forest Classifier and CNN + LSTM network—are used to forecast the
    best model for rainfall prediction after organizing the data and training. Further,
    a combined CNN + LSTM + Attention Layer based rainfall prediction and fruit health
    recognition system is designed which provides an integrated approach. The performance
    of this system is compared with the bench mark methods namely Cat-Boost, Gaussian
    NB, and Random Forest Classifier and CNN + LSTM network. Access to the web-server
    for these cloud resident tools is through an easy-to-use interface where the user
    may enter the criteria needed to predict when it will rain. Same is the case with
    fruit health monitoring. Results and discussion In this section, we discuss the
    results derived and the related details. Performance of the IoT set-up The primary
    programming code file is uploaded to the NodeMCU board using a USB cable after
    all hardware components have been installed. All findings are validated by looking
    at the serial monitor window. By manually disconnecting the DHT 11 sensor, the
    functionality of LED indicators is examined. It is confirmed that if the sensor
    is not connected to the microcontroller board, a red LED will light up, and a
    green LED will light up if all connections are sound. Figure 18 shows an experimental
    set-up of the system. Figures 19 and 20 show how all data are received and shown
    in the Android application monitor pane and Google Firebase real-time database.
    The water pump status is also checked by clicking ON/OFF button of pump controller
    in the Android application. Figure 18 Experimental setup of the proposed IoT system.

    The sensors data are acquired and displayed in the mobile application. The monitor
    window shows the temperature, humidity, soil moisture and air quality (presence
    of acetone) information at two particular instants, in presence of acetone and
    in absence of acetone as shown in Fig. 19. Although acetone occurs naturally in
    the environment in plants, trees, volcanic gases, forest fires, the majority of
    the acetone released into the environment is of industrial origin. Acetone condensation
    products reported to have growth regulating properties for their effects on seed
    germination. It means that acetone measurement is crucial for agricultural lands
    nearer to the industrial areas. Table 3 shows sensor reading at certain reading
    instants. Table 3 Sensors’ readings at different time instants. Full size table
    User can also perform manual controlling of the motor through the mobile application
    based on the parameter measured. Table 4 shows certain expert inputs leading to
    the formulation of a decision logic derived out of the sensor readings. Table

    A few algorithms are implemented and their AUC as well as accuracy score are checked.
    CatBoost The following algorithm suits the model perfectly as because it gives
    an accuracy score of 0.86 and AUC score of 0.89 as shown in Fig. 21. Figure 21
    Experimental result of CatBoost classifier. Full size image Random forest This
    algorithm suits the model but it has less accuracy and AUC score than CatBoost
    algorithm but it can also predict rainfall pretty well as shown in Fig. 22. Figure
    22 Experimental result of Random Forest classifier. Full size image Gaussian NB
    This is the least accurate model as both the AUC as well as the accuracy score
    are less than both CatBoost and Random Forest classifier as shown in Fig. 23.
    Figure 23 Experimental result of Gaussian NB classifier. Full size image Similarly,
    the CNN in the VGG16 configuration21 with LSTM layer at the end is trained with
    sensor data of two weeks and validated (Fig. 24). All the data are analyzed and
    summary outlined in Table 5. Figure 24 Root mean square and loss function values
    of the CNN + LSTM model used for rainfall prediction. Full size image Table 5
    Summary results representing the AUC and accuracy score derived for rainfall prediction.
    Full size table As shown in Table 5, among the different prediction techniques,
    the CNN + LSTM and Cat-Boost yield the best accuracies. However, CatBoost classifier
    has a higher memory usage and performs better when categorical data is available.
    Further, random forest classifier has greater processing criticality and requires
    long training times. Similarly, the Gaussian NB classifier assumes feature independence,
    an unrealistic consideration in case of real-world data. Moreover, the Gaussian
    NB classifier encounters the zero-probability situation which provides erroneous
    outcomes. Therefore, the CNN + LSTM combination is selected for the predicting
    the rainfall. Rainfall prediction After data augmentation, the graph is plotted
    featuring training and validation accuracy and training and validation loss. The
    blue line in Fig. 25 represents the training part and orange line represent validation
    part. The worst case (trained with a data set and tested with a sequence with
    illumination and resolution variation) accuracy is found out to be 89.38% and
    loss score is found out to be 0.3168 as shown in Fig. 25. The experimental results
    are shown in Fig. 26 obtained from the CNN + Softmax combination. Table 6 featuring
    the actual and the predicted identities along with confidence percentage obtained
    using a CNN classifier shows the reliability of the approach. Similar set of results
    are obtained for the other classifiers as well (CNN with Adam Optimizer, ResNet50
    and GoogLeNet). This is shown in Table 7. Figure 25 Experimental result of CNN + Softmax
    classifier. Full size image Figure 26 Experimental results of fruit health recognition

    Table 7 Performance of different classifiers as part of the fruit health recognition
    system. Full size table Interface of the websites A cloud-based service has been
    made available for online testing. Figures 27 and 28 show the screenshots of the
    web-interfaces. Cultivators of different parts of the north-east Indian state
    of Assam have been invited to use the services of the cloud resident app. The
    cultivators experienced latency in responses which varied with time and location.
    It is dependent on wireless coverage. But the accuracy obtained is as reported
    above. The impact of the system is associated with the fact that the buyer–seller
    relationship can be reinforced with the help of the system which has been made
    available for testing using the web-interface. Figure 27 Agricultural Management
    System website home page. Full size image Figure 28 Home page of fruit recognition
    website. Full size image Comparison with previous work and discussion A description
    of certain statistical indicators for predicting rainfall, identifying fruit health,
    and comparing current results is shown in Table 8. Additionally, it covers the
    memory requirements for each of the techniques applied in the work. We have taken
    into account categorical (17), continuous (14), discrete (2), and numerical (16)
    characteristics. Integers and floats are represented using numerical characteristics.
    Only one value can be used for discrete characteristics. There is a range of values
    for continuous features. Levels, or values, can be assigned to categorical features.
    In case of rainfall prediction, even though the CNN + LSTM combination requires
    more memory (than Gaussian NB Classifier) but lower than Cat-Boost Classifier,
    Random Forest Classifier, it performs better because due to the presence of the
    LSTM the tracking of the time dependent samples becomes superior. Even compared
    to CNN, the Adam Optimizer''s support to CNN provides excellent accuracy and is
    supported by memory-efficient processing. Systems with low memory requirements
    are more useful when running cloud-based apps. However, they are not appropriate
    for use in transfer learning. The hybrid CNN + LSTM + MHSA combination provides
    better accuracy, is light weight (as optimization is achieved), takes lesser training
    and testing times. Hence, it is found to be more suitable for a cloud resident
    combined rainfall predictor and fruit health recognizer. Exactly identical works
    have not been reported but a work of similar nature is32 where the authors have
    used ML and DL methods for winter wheat yield prediction using an extensive dataset
    of weather, soil, and crop phenology variables reporting an efficiency of around
    90%. The key aspect of the present work is its better precision (97%) while it
    combines fruit health monitoring and rainfall prediction using certain sensor
    inputs and samples images. Table 8 Summary of certain statistical metrics of rainfall
    prediction and fruit health recognition and comparison with previous results.
    Full size table Its better performance in certain situations is due, in part,
    to the unique capabilities brought to the design by combining CNN with LSTM, MHSA,
    and softmax layers. The LSTM layers capture dependencies and patterns in sequential
    data, but CNN excels in capturing spatial hierarchies of features in pictures
    or sequences and recognizing patterns independent of their location in the input
    space. Capturing input sequences'' global dependencies is an area where the MHSA
    performs well. Down this way, the model might have focused on pertinent data and
    create long-range relationships by giving varying weights to various portions
    of the input sequence. Rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring have both
    benefited from these improvements while adopting sensor data and picture processing.
    Here, we''ve described how to create a NodeMCU-based network, which offers benefits
    like easy database linkage, built-in WiFi connectivity, and good communication
    range. This technology supports a range of a few hundreds of meters and may be
    utilized both indoors and outdoors. The platform delivers a fusion of the sensors
    when every sensor is linked to NodeMCU. It is feasible to locate and identify
    sensor connection issues. A motor controller and real-time data monitoring for
    data analysis are included with the mobile app. The motor controller controls
    the condition of the water pump. The website is enhanced with all of the tools
    used for fruit health assessment and rainfall forecasting. The fruit health recognition
    webpage offers a good analysis of the input photographs to identify whether the
    fruit is rotting or ripe, and the rainfall prediction forecasts the weather for
    the following day. Data on soil moisture and temperature are collected with accuracy
    and precision by the modern agriculture management system developed utilizing
    IoT and ML techniques. Additionally, it helps farmers increase agricultural productivity
    and provide an atmosphere that is effective for growing food. It contributes to
    a decrease in over- and under-irrigation, soil erosion, and water waste by providing
    data from the used sensors. So, an automated system for monitoring fruit health
    and providing farming help with relation to water resources is a crucial tool
    for the cultivator and entrepreneurs. The cost-effectiveness of the whole effort
    can be improved with an automated method. In addition to the foregoing, the offered
    methodologies have quick execution times and dependable decision-making, which
    cannot always be matched by employees hired for the job. The sensor pack offers
    exact cutoff points at which water sprinklers could start. Additionally, it aids
    in reducing water waste. With human intervention, it would not always be possible
    to maintain the precise timing and volume of watering. With regard to fruit health
    monitoring, the same is true. The laborious and thorough nature of the work done
    by human workers may be inaccurate. A scalable, profitable, and effective production
    system can be developed using an IoT and machine learning (ML)-based agriculture
    management system. The statistical metrics for predicting rainfall, identifying
    fruit health, and comparing current results are shown in Table 8. The benefits
    of the suggested approach are obvious. However, the performance of the system
    is dependent on the latency of response which is a factor determined by wireless
    network coverage and certain hardware dependence. Conclusions Here, we reported
    the design of a precision agriculture setup with stress on adoption of sensors,
    IoT and ML to regulate water flow and process management so as to maximize crop
    yield. The work deals with the workings of various sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, and air quality sensors, in an IoT
    package to collect and monitor the real-time status of an agriculture management
    system associated with rainfall prediction and fruit health monitoring. The key
    aspect of the work is the design and configuration of a few ML algorithms namely
    CatBoost, Gaussian NB, Random Forest and CNN + LSTM classifiers trained to provide
    accurate rainfall prediction, fruit health monitoring and recognition (carried
    out using CNN + Softmax, Adam optimizer, GoogLeNet and ResNet50) and provide area
    under curve (AUC) scores as well as accuracy value under on field conditions.
    Further, we have designed a combined rainfall predictor and fruit health recognizer
    using a CNN + LSTM and a multi-head self-attention mechanism. This approach requires
    lesser memory, is more reliable and requires low computation time. These provide
    sufficient ground for formulation of an integrated agriculture assistant for cultivation
    of certain types of fruits. Experimental results show that the approach is precise
    and robust and the services are hosted using a web portal with a user-friendly
    interface. Data availability When requested, the authors will make available all
    data used in this study. Please, contact Prof. Kandarpa Kumar Sarma (kandarpaks@gauhati.ac.in).

    India''s agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem output.
    Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making effective
    use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with IoT enabled
    are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques face
    difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In this
    work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring
    using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web
    server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using
    normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data
    into meaningful data. Pre-processed data is then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit
    (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired
    from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian
    Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement
    of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction
    and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather
    conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by
    the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions
    and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers.
    The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance
    like 94% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98% accuracy for field monitoring.
    Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve

    monitoringGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 1. Introduction India has agriculture as
    its primary occupation. IBEF (Indian Brand Enquiry Foundation) estimates that
    58 % of Indians who live in rural areas depend on agriculture. Not only in underdeveloped
    countries but also in many industrialised countries, farming and agriculture make
    up a significant component of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (Karthick et al., 2018).
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. It will
    help handle global catastrophes like climate change and epidemics like draught
    in addition to fostering the flourishing sustainable development of people, flora,
    and fauna (Lavanya et al., 2020). Farmers still use traditional methods such as
    manual field monitoring, which involves often watering crops and applying pesticides
    to manage pests, whether or not they are aware of the appropriate dosage. These
    old methods include disadvantages such as water logging in fields, excessive use
    of pesticides and fungicides, lack of knowledge about the kind of crops that need
    to be cultivated for a certain type of soil fertility, and lower yields than anticipated
    from the agricultural area (AshifuddinMondal & Rehena, 2018). Many farmers continue
    to cultivate using traditional techniques, which leads to low crop yields (Sushanth
    & Sujatha, 2018). Better technology will increase yield, hence reducing the likelihood
    of famine and malnutrition. The technology should be inexpensive enough that it
    can have an influence on billions of people worldwide (Ogunti, 2019; Karthick
    & Muthukumaran, 2023). Monitoring of the soil, plants, moisture, and temperature,
    as well as the management of the infrastructure and control systems, are all necessary
    for agricultural production. IoT is essential in the sector of agriculture (Thakur
    et al., 2020). Since they are utilised to offer information about agricultural
    areas, all Internet of Things sensors is quite effective. A smart agriculture
    stick advertises the novel smart agriculture programme based on IoT that enables
    farmers to have access to real-time data to track how the environment is operating,
    enabling them to engage in smart farming, increase their final yield, and ensure
    that their product meets quality standards (Phasinam et al., 2022). A wireless
    sensor network is used by this advanced agricultural monitoring system to gather
    data from a number of sensors placed at various junctions. A great amount of data
    can be analysed using such technology in precision farming after being collected
    by WSN (Khanna & Kaur, 2019). It enables farmers to boost yields while using fewer
    resources. In industrialised countries, smart framing is being carried out on
    a wide scale combining IoT, AI, and agriculture data analysis (Goel et al., 2021).
    The Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture system demonstrated that
    distant sensors are used to monitor inside settings and that micro-scale controllers
    are utilised to control and operate indoor and remote sensing systems, including
    those that take pictures and videos and even use cameras (Panda & Bhatnagar, 2020).
    Farmers may monitor and manage the microclimate in the greenhouse, as well as
    illnesses and pests that impact the plants, with the aid of precision farming
    (Arora et al., 2021). The status of the plants can be impacted by a variety of
    external elements and microclimatic interior occurrences (Gunjan et al., 2022).
    Plant development and the spread of some diseases are both impacted by temperature
    and relative humidity (Daya Sagar et al., 2023). In terms of the effectiveness
    of greenhouses, it is one of the most detrimental agricultural production illnesses
    (Cambra et al., 2018). When ambient and micro-indoor conditions are favourable,
    controlling the irrigation of water quality is easier. When growing crops in greenhouses,
    it is essential to apply the appropriate fertiliser treatments or drip system
    cleanser at the appropriate time and location (Siddiquee et al., 2022). Understanding
    the stage of the production cycle at which specific nutrient solutions should
    be used is essential (Sai Surya Teja et al., 2023). The purpose of this paper
    is to make automated and continuous field monitoring for smart agriculture using
    IoT and deep learning technologies (Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). The main contribution
    of the proposed work is given below: • Automated and efficient field monitoring
    model is designed through combining IoT and deep learning technology to support
    farmers in achieving higher crop production. • Sensors are assembled in an agricultural
    field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud
    server for further analysis purposes. • Normalization and missing value imputation
    are used as data pre-processing techniques and GRU is used to forecast weather
    and soil conditions based on the acquired data. • Adaptive Gaussian filter and
    dynamic histogram equalization are used as image pre-processing techniques and
    CNN is used to detect the presence of disease using pre-processed crop image.
    • Alert SMS are sent to farmers regarding the horrible weather condition and diseases
    to render control action. Rest of the paper contains: Section 2 presents the literature
    review related to automated field monitoring. In Section 3 proposed methodology
    and architecture of the proposed methodology are given. Result and discussion
    part of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4. At last, Section 5 contains
    the conclusion part. 2. Literature review Several techniques for automatic forecasting
    of weather and field monitoring had been developed. The following section examines
    some of the current approaches utilized for weather forecasting and crop disease
    prediction in smart agriculture. (a) Weather and irrigation monitoring system
    An IoT-based smart irrigation management system combining machine learning and
    open source technology has been proposed by Goap et al. (2018). The proposed system''s
    intelligence is based on a smart algorithm that considers sensory data as well
    as elements of the short-term weather forecast, such as precipitation, air temperature,
    humidity, and UV. But the system cost of this suggested approach is high. Velmurugan
    (2020) have suggested a smart system that uses open-source technologies to forecast
    how much irrigation is needed for a given field. The entire system has been created
    and is currently being tested on a small-scale pilot project. Web-based information
    visualisation and decision support systems are used to wirelessly gather sensor
    node data via the cloud, and they deliver real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensor and weather forecast data. Singh et al. (2019) have
    suggested In an IoT-driven smart irrigation framework, machine learning techniques
    are used to maximise the irrigation water use by forecasting the future soil moisture
    of a field. The performance of various ML techniques is tested for predicting
    future soil moisture, and the GBRT outcomes are quite encouraging. Rani et al.
    (2020) have suggested a machine learning and neural networks-based flood monitoring
    system using IoT. This research outlines an efficient and adaptable technique
    for flood and system-altering system identification. The most cutting-edge technologies,
    including machine learning (ML), have a large positive impact on technology and
    are particularly effective at detecting both normal and pathological behaviour
    in any system. The most common, extensively used, and effective method for forecasting
    rainfall is neural networks. Real-time agricultural field monitoring utilising
    IoT-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles has been developed by Quach et
    al. (2021). A sensor network for gathering information on the ground is also incorporated,
    in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle system for remote sensing. Numerous
    sensor nodes are used in the sensor network to measure various environmental and
    plant factors, including temperature, humidity, and nitrogen content. The sensor
    network transmits data using LoRa, a low-power wide-area network modulation method
    that enables a single receiver to receive signals from sensor nodes up to 450
    m away. (b) Crop disease prediction In order to predict apple disease in Kashmir
    Valley apple orchards, Akhter and Sofi (2022) suggested using data analytics and
    machine learning in an IoT system. This study reaches a pinnacle in demonstrating
    the power and promise of computing tools like the internet of things, wireless
    sensor networks, data analytics, and machine learning in agriculture. A local
    poll was also conducted to find out from the farmers how the most recent technological
    advancements affect precision farming. Khamparia et al. (2020) developed a hybrid
    deep learning model merging autoencoder with Convolutional neural network for
    crop leaf disease prediction. Obtained dataset contained 900 image samples of
    three different crops and five types of disease. From total samples 600 images
    were considered for training process and remaining 300 was considered for testing
    process. Different convolution filter size of and was used in this developed approach
    achieving 97.5 % accuracy. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) developed deep learning
    model along with transfer learning for prediction of disease in rice leaf. In
    traditional farming, farmers spend lot of resources as well as time consuming
    due to visualizing through naked eye and it results in unhealthy farming. Object
    segmentation and classification was achieved using InceptionResNetV2 for recognizing
    disease in rice leaf image. Kaur et al. (2022) developed hybrid CNN model for
    detection of leaf disease through utilizing feature extraction and feature reduction
    approach. Using this developed approach four different types of diseases such
    as black measles, stable, black rot and leaf blight present in grapevines was
    recognized. Plant village dataset was collected and processed using EfficientNet
    B7 deep model using transfer learning. After extracting features it was further
    reduced by applying logistic regression. According to the literature, numerous
    systems are designed for automatic field monitoring with IoT. Based on the above
    mentioned articles several significant challenges arise in automatic weather forecasting
    and field monitoring approaches. High system cost (Goap et al., 2018), alerting
    system not available (Rani et al., 2020), and only considering a single parameter
    (Akhter and Sofi, 2022) are some of the issues in the existing algorithms. Thus
    effective field monitoring is not achieved using the existing research. So, the
    current research focuses on utilizing IoT and deep learning approach for automated
    and continuous field monitoring. 3. Proposed methodology In India, one of the
    most important economic sectors is agriculture. India''s increased agricultural
    activity can be attributed to the country''s abundant irrigation-supporting water
    supplies and highly productive soil. However, a number of circumstances stop the
    production of the projected yield from occurring. To overcome these aforementioned
    issues and to support farmers with better quality and quantity crops an improved
    automated and computer based technology is designed in this current research.

    Architecture of the Proposed IoT Based System for Improved Precision Agriculture.
    The agricultural area is equipped with several IoT-based sensor nodes to gather
    real-time data. The nodes that have been assembled gather data on the state of
    the soil, moisture content of the soil, presence of humidity, presence of pests,
    diseases, and insects, as well as photographs of plants and other things. The
    information is then either sent to a cloud server based on IoT or stored locally
    in a nearby fog node. The collected data is pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. Pre-processed data is then given as
    input for Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. Then,
    in the second step, the images of the crop are acquired to predict the presence
    of disease and pests. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using an Adaptive
    Gaussian filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization (DHE) for
    contrast enhancement of the image. Pre-processed image is then fed to ResNet50
    for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case
    of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be
    automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding
    the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message
    will be sent to the farmers. The proposed IoT and deep learning based model can
    support the farmers to achieve quantity and quality crop production in lesser
    time. 3.1. IoT based network for data acquisition The first step in putting together
    a weather forecasting and field monitoring system is setting up a wireless sensor
    network field where each node is linked by a Wi-Fi module as well as lays data
    over a server computer, form where an automated Python script can keep polling
    the information and then transmits alert/start messages for the required procedure.

    Distributed WSN. Data collection using numerous sensors placed around the field
    or garden is the first stage in creating an automatic weather forecasting and
    field monitoring system. The gateway node, or Raspberry Pi 3 B+, will handle all
    communication with the other sensor nodes. Advanced soil moisture sensors, GSM
    and Bluetooth modules, temperature and humidity sensors, MQ2 gas sensors, pH sensors,
    water level indicators, alarm and clock modules, batteries, and relay modules
    are all included in each Arduino mega unit. Ultrasonic sensor for rodents and
    significant intruder detection. Each node will send information to the raspberry
    pi3, which functions as both the base station and the gateway node. The data storage
    on the raspberry pi will be handled by a python script, from which it might be
    displayed to the user via an application layer. The intranet can also accomplish
    what it was designed to do for data transmission from the raspberry pi to the
    server, enabling its use of it in places with limited to no internet access. The
    basic principles of receiver, transmitter, ground, and positive are the basis
    for connecting various sensors to the microcontroller. The majority of connections
    need to be made in this way, because the Arduino Mega board includes a lot of
    digital pins, RXD, analogue pins and TXD in addition to a lot of Vcc and Gnd pins.
    After building the network topology and collecting the data, the first phase of
    the proposed applications is finished. Data processing begins with the initial
    phase of data collection using various sensors. 3.1.1. Node’s structural details
    Each node is made up of a micro-controller, which in this case is advised to be
    an Arduino mega because it most closely matches the scope of the solution. Each
    node has a soil moisture sensor, a Wi-Fi module, a temperature sensor, a DHT11
    sensor, a light intensity sensor, also a battery module linked to it. Fig. 3 below
    contains each node''s block diagram. Download : Download high-res image (161KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Configuration of each sensor node.
    In order to transmit further signals to the actuators and inform the end user
    in the event that manual intrusion is required, all of the data collected by the
    sensors must be processed and analysed. 3.2. Data analysis The data kept on a
    cloud server is also taken into account for analytical purposes, whereby an AI
    system is used to predict the weather, the characteristics of the soil, irrigation,
    and illness. To automate the forecast of various agricultural aspects and take
    corrective action to increase crop output, AI systems are being considered. However
    in the data analysis process initially the information regarding temperature,
    humidity, moisture and soil condition are considered. 3.2.1. Weather monitoring
    (a) Data pre-processing The sensors'' entire collection of data has to be evaluated
    and handled. The given input datasets such as temperature, humidity moisture and
    soil properties contains some missing values. Normalization and mean based missing
    value imputation are used in the proposed method to convert the raw data into
    meaningful data which is required for classification. (b) Normalization Normally,
    attributes from the raw data are high variables and not present in a specified
    range. To accomplish a better outcome, the attributes from the data are kept in
    a uniform range of [A, B]. So here, min–max normalization method is used to normalize
    the attribute ranges. A mathematical formulation of min–max normalization is given
    in Eq. (1). (1) where represents the original value, denotes the maximum value
    of and indicates the minimum value of . (c) Mean based Missing value Imputation
    Imputation using mean values, also known as rough imputation, is a quick and simple
    imputation method that employs the mean value of all the data on the variable
    to be improved. Imputation of numerical variables is done using the mean. This
    rough imputation not only ignores the amount of variance but also the connection
    between variables, resulting in inaccurate estimations. The rough imputation approach
    should only be used when just a few missing data are present, and it is not designed
    for broad usage and is given in Eq. (2). (2) where represents the sample mean,
    and the total of each value in the sample is represented by , while the number
    of values in the population is represented by . 3.2.2. Classification A classifier
    is an algorithm that organises data into labelled informational classes or categories.
    In this designed model, GRU is used to forecast the weather. (a) Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) A GRU can be viewed as a simplification and improvement of LSTM and
    is comparable in performance to LSTM. Introduce LSTM before giving a comprehensive
    description of a GRU. The hidden state is the most crucial portion of an RNN because
    it is in charge of remembering or forgetting certain information (Li et al., 2020).
    From top to bottom, GRU has a total of three layers. The 10 node input layer is
    in charge of feeding information into the hidden layer. The output unit, which
    contains two nodes and one layer, is in charge of classifying and producing the
    data processed from the hidden layer using the SoftMax classifier. 32 nodes and
    one layer make up the hidden layer. The hidden layer''s output processed data
    is handled using one-hot encoding, a real output that is gained following the
    decoding procedure. GRU consists of two gates a reset gate and an update gate
    . The two gates cooperate to regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory
    cell. Although they both use the input and the preceding concealed state to calculate
    them, their functions are distinct. A GRU makes some reductions in complexity
    compared to LSTM. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the GRU''s organisational structure.
    Eq. (3) provides the link relationship seen in Fig. 4. (3) Download : Download
    high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of
    the GRU. In Eq. (3), candidate’s output is represented by , output vector is indicated
    using and represents the input vector. The reset gate of the GRU is designated
    by the letter , and the output gate by the letter (Xu et al., 2018). This GRU
    network is used in proposed approach to forecasting the weather in the agriculture
    area. 3.2.3. Disease prediction (a) Image pre-processing The sensors'' entire
    collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. From the information collected
    from the nodes, the Python programmes running on the Raspberry Pi will check for
    certain criteria. The input crop image dataset is pre-processed in order to convert
    the raw image into a meaningful image. Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram
    equalization technique to remove noise and to improve the quality of the image
    for achieving accurate prediction. (b) Adaptive Gaussian filter When using a conventional
    Canny edge detector operator, the Gaussian filter is employed to smooth out the
    image and minimise the parasitic effect that sampling quantization has on the
    image. Due to the fact that both the edge and the noise are high frequency signals,
    the filter operator smoothes the image''s edges while suppressing the noise, which
    affects how accurately the edges are identified. An updated Gaussian filtering
    algorithm is put forth to address this issue; it decides whether to apply a Gaussian
    filter based on the disparity between the pixel''s grey value and the grey mean
    in the surrounding area. If the noise interferes with the image, it can be written
    as in Eq. (4): (4) where is the noise signal. When there is noise, the difference
    between the noise-affected pixel''s grey value also its neighbouring pixels is
    described as in Eq. (5). (5) Due to the approximate zero interference free D,
    the mean value difference between the point grey value of the noise-affected image
    pixel and its neighbouring pixels, called , is roughly equal to , which is the
    degree of noise hopping. (c) Dynamic histogram equalization The cropped image''s
    total number of pixels is used as the basis for the spanning function used by
    the equalisation method to perform equalisation (Dhal et al., 2018). Histogram
    equalisation and mapping the image pixels to a dynamic range are the two stages
    of the process. (d) Mapping image pixels to dynamic range The dynamic range for
    the output sub-histograms can be obtained from as Eqs. (5), (6). (6) (7) The exceptions
    are present at the two extremities, where (e) Equalizing each sub-histogram Similar
    to how a global histogram is equalised, each image''s histogram is equalised using
    the same process. The remapped values for the ith sub-histogram are derived as
    in Eq. (8). (8) where is the new intensity level corresponding to the intensity
    level on the original image, is the histogram value at the intensity level on
    the fuzzy histogram and is the total population count in the partition of the
    fuzzy histogram. 3.2.4. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises
    data into clearly defined categories or classes. In this designed model, ResNet50
    a kind of CNN model is used to predict plant diseases. (a) Residual Neural Network
    (ResNet50) The goal of CNN''s back propagation method is to automatically discover
    the spatial hierarchies of feature classes. Convolution, pooling, and fully connected
    (FC) units are common building components utilized in the creation of CNNs. The
    process of repeatedly running the input image through the selected filter is the
    foundation of the convolutional layer''s operation. The filter can be 3 × 3, 5
    × 5 or 7 × 7 pixels in size. As a result, the image with the filter applied to
    it becomes the input of the following layer (m2 × m3). Activation maps are created
    as a result of this convolution process. Local unique elements can be seen on
    activation maps. A filter (m1) exists for each convolutional layer (Toğaçar et
    al., 2020). The output of layer l is made up of feature maps with dimension The
    ith subset of features, displayed as , is calculated utilizing Eq. (9). The matrix
    bias is indicated by and denotes size of the filter. (9) The pooling units preserves
    image characteristics while reducing image size also expenses while maintaining
    image information. This structure reduces the number of parameters, the filter''s
    spatial dimension, and the step. It takes information in the following sizes as
    input: , and again outcomes Eqs. (10), (11), (12) demonstrates, in brief how the
    pooling layer functions. (10) (11) (12) The characteristics from the preceding
    stage are flattened before being assigned to the FC layers, which update the weights
    also provide the final values for each label. An actual multi-layered sensor for
    mapping is a convolutional network with fully interlinked units. In Eq. (13),
    the FC layer''s processing stages are displayed. (13) In the proposed method CNN
    model such as ResNet 50 is used for the training of plant disease image dataset.
    Fig. 5 illustrates a building block for residual learning. A remarkable architecture
    made up of residual layers is called ResNet. Furthermore, ResNet is distinct in
    that it substitutes a collection of global average pooling layers for the more
    customary set of fully linked layers at the network’s conclusion. ResNet50 is
    a type of residual network with 50 layers. Each group of identical layers in the
    ResNet50 design is unique. ResNet calculates data from one layer to the next that
    must occur in order to arrive at the final forecast. ResNet helps to mitigate
    the problem of vanishing gradients by offering an alternative shortcut route for
    gradient to flow through. The model can skip a CNN weight layer if the current
    layer is not necessary thanks to the ResNet identity mapping algorithm (Theckedath
    & Sedamkar, 2020). This assists in preventing the over-fitting issue with the
    training set. This ResNet50 classifier used in the proposed method classifies
    the plant diseases in agricultural land. Predicted data using deep learning approach

    fertilisers and illness in the agricultural field will all be checked when the
    smart agricultural monitoring system is turned on. The water pump will automatically
    start if the temperature is really high. Then if the soil moisture is going down
    then the water pump will start automatically. Nutrient levels of the soils are
    then checked. If nutrient deficiencies occurred then an automatic fertilization
    machine is turned on to spray the fertilizer on the agricultural land. If the
    plants are affected by a particular disease means the automatic pesticide sprayer
    will start automatically. The smart agriculture monitoring system uses a GSM module
    to communicate with mobile devices and establish SMS alerts on the mobile device
    about the levels. 4. Result and discussion Agriculture and farming contribute
    significantly to the GDP of many affluent countries as well as emerging countries.
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. A critical
    matter that requires the highest appropriateness to be addressed is the necessity
    for agricultural maintenance and the rising water issues. To build an automated
    and continuous field monitoring, the proposed research focus on IoT and deep learning
    approach. The proposed GRU and ResNet50 are tested on MATLAB 2021a with intel
    core i5 and 8 GB RAM. Simulation parameters for GRU and ResNet50 are given in

    Period 10 The installation of a wireless sensor network is the first step in the
    implementation of weather forecasting and field monitoring. In order to gather
    real-time data, several IoT-based sensor nodes are set up in the agricultural
    field. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the environmental conditions,
    soil condition, moisture condition, presence of humidity fertility of the soil,
    and presence of the pest, diseases, and insects also capture images of plants
    and so. The collected information’s either stored locally in the nearby fog node
    or transmitted to the cloud server based on IoT. The agricultural node with sensor
    nodes and sensor node deployment used for this proposed approach is illustrated

    purposes in which the prediction of weather, soil properties, irrigation and disease
    is achieved by means of AI system. The reason for considering AI systems is to
    achieve automated prediction of varying agricultural factors and take remedial
    action for higher crop yield. 4.1. Dataset description Different sensors are placed
    in the agricultural field for monitoring purpose to support smart in order to
    perform healthy farming. The collected sensor data is processed using AI system

    different datasets collected from publicly available is taken for analysis. Description
    regarding different dataset is given below. Dataset 1: This data contains details
    regarding district wise crop area, season, temperature different types of crops,
    production in hectares and yield. The statistics is collected from 1997 to 2021
    and it is obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare of India.
    Data is acquired from 35 states and union territory. Dataset 2: For the purpose
    of monitoring and controlling an irrigation system in real-time, data is gathered
    using a wireless sensor network. This method prevents water waste while providing
    the farm and garden with uniform and necessary water levels. This method aims
    to provide an automated irrigation mechanism that activates and deactivates the
    pumping motor in response to the amount of moisture in the ground. In this system,
    the soil moisture sensor, dht11 sensor, and NodeMCU are all used to interface
    with the Arduino board. Using these sensors, the data is collected. Dataset 3:
    Data related to soil nutrients is collected from department of agriculture and
    farmers welfare. Different types of nutrients are essential to be present in the
    soil for plant growth. Various soil nutrients includes pH, Electrical Conductivity
    (EC), Iron (Fe), Organic Carbon (OC), Nitrogen (N), Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus
    (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (zn). Dataset
    4: This dataset contains both unhealthy as well as healthy leaves image. Total
    number of image samples present in the dataset is 3600 images of RGB. It contains
    healthy apple leave and diseased apple leaves such as scab, black rot and cedar.

    moisture (Dataset 2) and nutrients (Dataset 3) are pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. GRU is utilized as a classifier for
    predicting weather condition. This proposed GRU classifier is compared with existing
    classifiers like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest
    Neighbour (KNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The performance metrics used
    for comparison between proposed and existing classifiers are accuracy, precision,
    recall, error, specificity, F1_Score, NPV, FNR and FPR. AUC plot and ROC plot
    of the proposed approach is depicted in Fig. 8. To validate or show the effectiveness
    of a multi-class categorization problem, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC
    (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used. The degree or amount of
    separability is represented by AUC. In the proposed method, AUC plot is close
    to 1, so it has a high level of separability. The ROC curve is a probability curve
    that demonstrates how effective the model can discriminate across classes. Table

    4.3. Disease prediction Crop images (Dataset 4) acquired from sensor nodes are
    used to predict the presence of diseases and pests. The crop diseases dataset

    The agricultural area’s temperature is first checked using a temperature sensor.
    When abnormal conditions occur like a high temperature greater than or equal to
    35 degree centigrade then the controller sends message to the owner using 19:19:19
    to spray on the leaves of small crops for 15 min to protect the crop from sun''s
    effect. Because of the sun''s heat and high temperature crop growth decrease so
    to avoid it use that fertilizer. The temperature always monitored and displayed
    on LCD which is detected by temperature sensor. When detected high moisture in
    the soil it causes root rot in crops, then this system detects moisture conditions
    and sends that information to owner to protect crop from root rot using copper
    oxychloride 3gmsspltr use at root zone of plants. When a farmer wants to switch
    on motor manually by sending message from his mobile to system with a message
    as “#M ON*” and to switch off motor when he wants then send message as “#M OFF*”.
    Again he wants a change in auto mode he sends a message from his mobile to system
    as “#AUTO*”. When the system detects that disease affected on crops and sends
    that information to the owner to protect crop from diseases by spraying fertilizer
    named as a pyrethroid. The agrobot carries the sprinkler motor which sprays the
    pesticide. It is in ON state till it moves at the end of agricultural land. 5.
    Conclusion Automated weather forecasting and field monitoring using AI based deep
    learning approach is focused in this current research. Traditional farming results
    in unhealthy crops because of poor weather and soil condition, crops affected
    through diseases and pest. To overcome these issue automated weather forecasting
    and field monitoring is essential to support farmers to produce healthy crops
    with higher yield quantity. In this current research initially, sensors are assembled
    in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit
    it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. The assembled nodes capture
    information regarding the temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient and capture
    images of plants and so. In first phase, the previous collected data for weather
    forecasting was pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value
    imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data was
    then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the temperature and soil
    moisture content for upcoming years. In the second phase, the crop images acquired
    from sensors to predict the presence of disease are pre-processed using Adaptive
    Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization to improve
    the image''s brightness. The pre-processed image was then fed to ResNet50 for
    feature extraction and classification. In the third phase, in case of any horrible
    weather conditions and soil conditions observed by these predicted data, remedial
    action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information
    regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert
    message will be sent to farmers. Graphical representation proves that the proposed
    approach results are significantly better than those of existing approaches. Accuracy,
    precision, recall and specificity obtained for weather forecasting is 94 %, 94
    %, 93 % and 93 %. Following that Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity reached
    for crop disease prediction is 98 %,98 %, 98 % and 98 %. Thus, the deep learning
    techniques used in proposed approach are the best choice for automated weather
    forecasting and field monitoring to support precision agriculture. In future,
    by utilizing AI and surveillance, the field area may be kept free of intruders.

    Since the 21th century, the global population has experienced rapid growth. Despite
    efforts in the agriculture sector to keep up with the demand of food, the pace
    of population growth has outstripped agricultural production (Ahmed et al., 2024).
    Consequently, this imbalance has resulted in an uneven distribution of essential
    nutrients such as protein, fat and calories in the diet consumed by the people
    (Pradhan et al., 2019). According to United Nation’s estimates, there are over
    900 million malnourished people worldwide with one fourth of them being children
    under the age group of four or five. These young children are particularly vulnerable
    to the adverse effects of severe protein and energy malnutrition (PEM). The primary
    cause of inadequate access to nutritious remains a significant factor contributing
    to under-nutrition, especially among children in many developing countries (UN,
    2010). Over the past few decades, fish has emerged as a significant protein source
    in many developing countries (Ahmed and Ahmad, 2020, FAO, 2020, Ahmad et al.,
    2021. Ahmad et al., 2021, Ahmad et al., 2021a, Ahmad et al., 2021b; Ahmad et al.,
    2022). The nutritional value of fish is unquestionable as it is rich in high-quality
    protein, essential micronutrients and omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids. Notably,
    fish exhibits more pronounced satiating effects compared to terrestrial animal
    proteins like beef and chicken meat (Uhe et al., 1992). Around 60 % of people
    in developing countries heavily depend on fish for at least 30 % of their animal
    protein intake, while nearly 80 % of the population in most developed countries
    obtain less than 20 % of the animal protein from fish (FAO, 2022). However, some
    Asian countries show a relatively higher reliance on fish (Delgado, 2003). Despite
    fish plays a crucial role in sustaining a significant segment of the global population,
    with a major portion of the diet consisting of fish and fishery related products
    (Minar et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2015, Gandotra et al., 2017). It’s availability
    is being compromised by unsustainable fishing practices in natural water bodies.
    This management is contributing to a deficiency in providing nutritionally adequate
    food for the populations of developing countries. Worldwide total catch of fisheries
    production in 2016 was around 91 million tons, involving about 79 million tons
    from marine waters and only 12 million tons from inland waters (FAO, 2018). By
    2030, an extra quantity or quantum of 37 million tons of fish for each year will
    be needed to meet the demand of current degrees of fish utilization for an extended
    world population. As capture fisheries is showing the indications of nearly stagnation
    for last one decade, there is a dire need to tap extra sources of resources that
    can be achieved through the mobilization of water bodies. Aquaculture emerges
    as a viable solution to this challenge, offering the potential to significantly
    augment overall fish production (Allan, 2004, Khursheed et al., 2023). To address
    the growing disparity between demand and supply on a global scale, advanced aquaculture
    technologies represent the sole viable recourse. Although different traditional
    techniques have already been employed in aquaculture, but recent technological
    advancements promise to reduce human intervention and enhance aquaculture productivity.
    Notably, AI stands out as a transformative force in the aquaculture industry (Mustapha
    et al., 2021). AI technologies are actively employed in monitoring and managing
    fish health and growth, leading to improved feed, diminished risk of disease outbreaks,
    and enhanced overall farm productivity. Geetha and Bhanu (2018) reported that
    the involvement of developmental algorithms and models in AI, enabling that conventially
    necessitate human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning and problem-solving.
    In the realm of aquaculture, AI facilitates the analysis of data derived from
    sensors and cameras to monitor fish behaviour, detect signs of disease or stress,
    employ automatic sensors for measuring fish length and weight, and optimize feeding
    regimes (Barreto et al., 2022, Føre et al., 2018, Tonachella et al., 2022). By
    analyzing this data using AI algorithms, researchers can develop predictive models
    that can identify the early signs of disease or stress in fish (Gladju et al.,
    2022). Sharma and Kumar (2021) emphasize the role of integrated sensors, biosensors,
    and AI in minimizing the reliance on antibiotics and other medications. Furthermore,
    AI contributes to the formulation of personalized feeding programs tailored to
    meet the nutritional requirements of individual fish, optimizing growth rates
    and fostering improved overall health and well-being (Kaur et al., 2021). It can
    also help to improve the management of fish reproduction, by developing predictive
    models that can identify the optimal conditions for spawning and egg production
    (Chapman et al., 2014, Migaud et al., 2013). This review comprehensively synthesis
    the application of AI to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture
    industry, particularly in the domains of fish reproduction, feeding, and growth.
    A compilation of prior studies on AI applications is presented in Table 1, Table
    2. Moreover, this paper aims to delve into the myriad applications of AI in aquaculture
    elucidating potential benefits and addressing the challenges and limitations that
    must be surmounted to fully exploit its potential. Table 1. An overview of some

    yields Overview of Artificial intelligence (AI) AI refers to the simulation or
    approximation of human intelligence in machines. The aim of AI includes computer-enhanced
    learning, reasoning and perception (Xu et al., 2021). In recent years, AI has
    grown an importance in aquaculture research and production, with both start-ups
    and established corporations developing new AI-based applications for the industry
    (The Lutz Report, 2023). Data mining and machine learning are two closely related
    techniques that are commonly used in the field of AI to analyze large amounts
    of data and extract useful insights and knowledge. While they share some similarities,
    there are also few differences between the two techniques (Sarker, 2022). Data
    mining refers to the process of extracting patterns and relationships from large
    datasets. It involves using a variety of statistical and computational techniques
    to identify trends, associations, and anomalies in the data. Data mining techniques
    can be used to explore the data, identify patterns and relationships, and develop
    predictive models that can be used to make decisions based on the data (Wu et
    al., 2021). Machine learning, on the other hand is a subfield of AI that involves
    the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions
    or decisions based on that learning (Sarker, 2021). Machine learning algorithms
    are designed to identify patterns and relationships in data, and then use those
    patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data (Choudhury et al., 2021).
    There are several different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (Mahesh, 2020). Supervised
    learning algorithms are trained on labelled data, where the correct answers are
    known, and are used to make predictions or decisions about new data learning (Mahesh,
    2020). Unsupervised learning algorithms, on the other hand, are trained on unlabelled
    data, where the correct answers are not known, and are used to identify patterns
    and relationships in the data (Patel, 2019). Reinforcement learning algorithms
    are used to train agents to take actions in an environment in order to maximize
    a reward. Both data mining and machine learning techniques are widely used in
    a variety of industries and applications, including finance, healthcare, marketing,
    and more (Sarker, 2021). They are particularly useful in fields where large amounts
    of data are available, and where there is a need to extract insights and knowledge
    from that data in order to make informed decisions. An overview of some studies
    related to AI in aquaculture is presented in Table 1. Considering the revolutionary
    of AI and machine learning, present review has been designed to summarize the
    role, importance and future perspectives of AI in aquaculture. Types of AI AI
    refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
    to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as perception,
    reasoning, learning, and decision-making (Xu et al., 2021). AI is a broad field
    that encompasses various subfields and applications, and there are several types
    of AI (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (229KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its types. Based on functionalities,
    types of AI are as below; Reactive AI: This type of AI is programmed to react
    to specific situations or inputs but cannot learn from past experiences or make
    predictions about the future (Sarker., 2022). Limited Memory AI: This type of
    AI can learn from past experiences and make decisions based on that knowledge,
    but it has limited memory and cannot consider a large amount of data (Xu et al.,
    2021). Theory of Mind AI: This type of AI can understand the beliefs, emotions,
    and intentions of other agents, making it useful for applications such as social
    robotics. Self-Aware AI: This type of AI has a sense of self and can understand
    its own capabilities and limitations. Based on Capabilities following are types
    of AI; Narrow AI: Weak AI, commonly referred to as narrow AI, is limited to performing
    a single narrow task. It advances along the spectrum of a single subset of cognitive
    talents. As machine learning and deep learning techniques advance, specialised
    AI applications are appearing more frequently in our daily lives (Sarker., 2022).
    General AI: General AI, also known as strong AI, is capable of understanding and
    learning any intellectual task that a human being is capable of. It enables a
    machine to apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts. So far, AI researchers
    have not been able to achieve strong AI. They have to figure out how to make machines
    conscious, programming a full set of cognitive abilities. Super AI: Outperforms
    human intelligence and is capable of performing any task better than a human.
    Artificial super intelligence envisions AI evolving to be so similar to human
    sentiments and experiences that it not only understands them, but also elicits
    emotions, needs, beliefs, and desires of its own. Its existence is still speculative.
    Thinking, solving puzzles, making judgements, and making decisions on its own
    are some of the critical characteristics of super AI (Xu et al., 2021; Sarker,
    2022). Potential applications of artificial intelligence in aquaculture Aquaculture
    stands as a rapidly expanding industry that demands significant technological
    advancements to improve farming practises. To enhance productivity, the development
    of novel farming methods is imperative and AI emerges as a key in many ways. Nowadays,
    AI gadgets are accessible to provide a more stable environment for the stock.
    Although there are several applications of AI in aquaculture, but here we discuss
    few of them in detail as below: 1. Use of AI in monitoring water quality. Effective
    water quality monitoring is paramount for the success of aquaculture operations
    (Lindholm-Lehto, 2023), given the multifaceted factors influencing it. Some of
    them are necessary to keep water at least as sustainable as possible. Fish activity
    can be directly impacted by the water quality due to the fish’s high reliance
    on the aquatic environment. Monitoring water quality is therefore a crucial problem
    to take into account, particularly in the fish farming industry (Arafat et al.,
    2020) and AI is increasingly being used to help in this area (Lu et al., 2022).
    This section aims to elucidate how AI can be effectively employed in monitoring
    water quality within aquaculture systems. By analyzing data from sensors that
    measure parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and ammonia levels
    (Dupont et al., 2018), AI algorithms can detect patterns and anomalies that may
    indicate problems with the water quality (Zhao et al., 2021, Khurshid et al.,
    2022). This can help farmers to take corrective actions before any harm is done
    to the fish. AI-powered water quality monitoring systems can continuously monitor
    multiple parameters in real-time, which can provide more accurate and timely information
    than manual monitoring methods (Javaid et al., 2022). This allows farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes in water quality, reducing the risk of fish mortality and
    other negative outcomes. AI assumes a pivotal role in developing predictive models
    that anticipate changes in water quality before they occur. It can be helpful
    in analyzing the historical data on water quality and other factors such as weather
    patterns and feeding schedules (Saeed et al., 2022). Besides, AI algorithms can
    predict the likelihood of changes in water quality and provide early warnings
    to farmers. Gunda et al. (2018) have developed an AI-based mobile application
    platform for water quality monitoring for bacterial contamination, where they
    have used a low-cost rapid test kit i.e., Mobile water kit for detecting the water
    quality for bacterial contamination. Moreover, AI algorithms can help farmers
    to optimize water quality parameters based on the specific needs of the fish species
    being farmed (Chiu et al., 2022). Aldhyani et al. (2020) developed advanced AI
    algorithms to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification
    (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear
    autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep
    learning algorithm have been developed. In addition to this, three machine learning
    algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) and
    Naive Bayes have been used for the WQC forecasting. Their results revealed that
    the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality
    according to superior robustness. Moreover, temperature is a critical factor in
    aquaculture, as it directly affects the health and growth of aquatic organisms
    (Mugwanya et al., 2022). AI algorithms can analyze data from temperature sensors
    in fish farms to monitor water temperature continuously. By this technique, the
    system can identify patterns and anomalies in the temperature data and provide
    real-time alerts to farmers if the temperature deviates from the optimal range
    for the specific fish species being farmed (Yang et al., 2021). This will allow
    farmers to detect changes in temperature quickly and take appropriate actions
    to maintain optimal conditions for the health and growth of the fish (Mustafa
    et al., 2016, Joseph et al., 2019, Chiu et al., 2022). By continuously monitoring
    the temperature, AI algorithms can also provide valuable insights to farmers on
    the impact of environmental changes on the fish and help to prevent potential
    problems that may arise due to changes in temperature (Føre et al., 2018). Besides
    this, AI algorithms can identify trends and patterns in the data, which can indicate
    potential risks to the health and growth of the fish (Manoj et al., 2022). This
    might be explained that when temperature increases rapidly, it may indicate a
    problem with the cooling system, which could lead to higher mortality rates for
    the fish (FAO, 2018). AI algorithms can also analyze data from other environmental
    factors such as water quality, feed management and weather patterns to provide
    a holistic view of the fish farm''s conditions (Lafont et al., 2019). By integrating
    this data, AI algorithms can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights
    to farmers on how different environmental factors can impact the health and growth
    of the fish (Niloofar et al., 2021). This can help farmers make more informed
    decisions on how to optimize their fish farm operations and prevent potential
    problems that may arise due to changes in temperature or other environmental factors
    (Gladju et al., 2022). Considering the findings of these studies, it can be inferred
    that AI algorithms can provide valuable insights to fish farmers. 2. Use of AI
    in disease detection and prevention A pivotal application of AI in bolstering
    the health and well-being of fish within aquaculture system revolves around disease
    identification and control. Numerous studies have focused on the use of AI for
    disease detection and management, optimization of feeding regimes and management
    of fish reproduction (Fig. 2). In the realm of aquaculture operations, the increasing
    utilization of AI is notably evident in the identification and treatment of fish
    infections (Li et al., 2023). AI can be used in analyzing the data from sensors
    and cameras to find indicators of illness or stress in fish. Cameras, for instance,
    can be used to observe fish behaviour and spot alterations that can point to stress
    or disease, such decreased activity levels or unusual swimming behaviour. Chen
    et al. (2022) reported that advanced disease identification based on fish behaviour
    and external appearance has been identified as a promising field for AI use. In
    addition, this detection system is based on underwater cameras or sensors to capture
    images that are sent through the cloud to the processing unit and scoring system.
    This gives artisanal farmers considerably more time to seek for management solutions
    (Darapaneni et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (513KB) Download

    in aquaculture. Analyzing fish photos for disease indicators is another method
    of applying AI to the identification of disease in fish (Yang et al., 2021). It
    can detect disease symptoms like lesions, odd behaviour, or discolouration by
    examining fish photos captured by cameras in the fish farm (Nik Zad, 2013, Chan
    et al., 2022). This can help farmers in early disease detection and treatment,
    limiting the demand for antibiotics and the risk of outbreaks. This method can
    assist aquaculturists in identifying fish infections sooner, which can enhance
    treatment results and lessen the disease''s ability to spread to other fish populations.
    Analyzing water quality data for disease indicators is another method of employing
    AI for fish disease identification (Setiyowati et al., 2022). Temperature, pH,
    and dissolved oxygen levels are a few examples of water quality variables that
    can have an impact on fish health and reveal the existence of specific diseases.
    AI programmes can be used to examine data on water quality and spot trends that
    can point out the presence of disease (Nayan et al., 2021). AI algorithms can,
    for instance, assess environmental information like temperature, precipitation,
    and nutrition levels to forecast when and where disease outbreaks are likely to
    occur (Elavarasan et al., 2018). This can assist aquaculturists in taking proactive
    steps to stop the spread of disease and lower the possibility of suffering financial
    losses (Rajitha et al., 2007). Besides, the use of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals
    may be decreased by using AI tools and techniques to perform early interventions,
    such as modifying water quality indicators or delivering tailored therapies (Holmes
    et al., 2016). Furthermore, several studies explored the use of AI to analyze
    the video data from salmon farms to detect changes in behaviour that may indicate
    stress or disease. The researchers used a deep learning algorithm to identify
    behavioural patterns in the fish, and were able to detect early signs of disease
    with a high degree of accuracy. Wu et al. (2022) studied four major aspects of
    deep-sea aquaculture including intelligent feeding, water quality detection, biomass
    estimation, and underwater inspection. This transitional development has changed
    the traditional manual way to mechanization, then to automation, hence named as
    unmanned intelligent equipment. Use of these intelligent equipment in various
    fields of aquaculture can reduce labour cost, reduce threats and can increase
    working potential. Lee et al. (2000) used fuzzy logic-based control system for
    denitrification in a closed recirculation system. They developed a computer-control
    denitrifying bioreactor for a system housing squid for biomedical research. This
    Fuzzy logic can be used to process real-time inputs from sensors used to measure
    dissolved oxygen, oxidation–reduction potential and pH and in turn controls the
    pumping rates and addition carbon feed to the bioreactor. Overall, the use of
    AI to fish disease detection has the potential to dramatically enhance the health
    and wellbeing of fish populations raised in aquaculture. Table 3 shows some techniques
    which are being used in disease detection. However, further research is needed
    to explore the full range of applications of AI in aquaculture, and to develop
    more advanced and sophisticated AI algorithms and models. Table 3. Use of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) in disease detection. S. No Disease diagnosis Technique/tool

    For determining fish health and growth rate during the growing stage, biomass
    is one of the most crucial factors (Li et al., 2020). The manual procedure for
    estimating biomass entails sampling using a fishing net or tray, catching each
    fish, weighing them individually, and then calculating the biomass (Martinez-de
    et al., 2003). It is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, which makes
    it difficult to estimate a larger number of samples for precise biomass estimation
    (Cai et al., 2020). Additionally, it shows a higher level of measurement errors
    brought on by human error. This procedure stresses the fish, which may have negative
    consequences like growth retardation, nerve damage, and even death. Manually handling
    dead fish during post-processing for biomass estimation also compromises the texture
    and quality of the product (Zion, 2012). As a result, extensive research has been
    done to investigate alternative techniques for estimating biomass (Li et al.,
    2020). The use of AI offers new opportunities for modern aquaculture. Meanwhile,
    combining machine learning and vision can more precisely estimate fish''s size,
    weight, number, and other biological data. Machine learning and computer vision
    have emerged as powerful tools in various domains and their application in estimating
    the weight of fish showcases their potential in fisheries management and environmental
    monitoring (Monkman et al., 2019). Several studies and research projects have
    explored the use of machine learning algorithms to more accurately estimate the
    weight of fish. One notable approach involves utilizing computer vision techniques
    to analyze images of fish and extract relevant features for weight prediction.
    Bravata et al. (2020) highlights the implementation of convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) to process images of fish and predict their weight with high accuracy.
    The study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in capturing intricate
    patterns and characteristics that contribute to weight variations among different
    fish species. Another study by Lopez-Tejeida et al. (2020) improved a method to
    obtain fish weight using machine learning and NIR camera with Haar Cascade Classifier.
    They reported that by the implementation of hardware and software adds an infrared
    light and pass band filter for the camera successfully, the fish was detected
    automatically, and the fish weight and length were calculated moreover the future
    weight was estimated. a. Size estimates: Body lengths of harvested fish are key
    indices for marine resource management. Some fisheries management organizations
    require fishing vessels to report the lengths of harvested fish (Tseng et al.,
    2020). Conventionally, body lengths of fish are measured manually using rulers
    or tape measures. Such methods are, however, time consuming, labour intensive,
    and subjective. Several researchers have used the ImageNet dataset and the Atlantic
    fish dataset to conduct algorithmic research on estimates of fish size. For estimating
    the length of European bass under various architectures, Monkman et al. (2019)
    suggested the R-CNN model. In addition, the author used OpenCV to calculate the
    image and increase accuracy in light of the image distortion. According to the
    findings, the typical deviation percentage was 2.2 %. b. Age determination: One
    of the main methods of fish age discrimination used presently is the automatic
    interpretation and recognition of fish age using fish otolith images (Bermejo
    et al., 2007). Machine learning has been successfully used for tasks like object
    recognition and other types of image analysis, and it is essential for otolith
    image-based age estimation. In order to determine the age of fish, Moen et al.
    (2018) used deep learning to automatically interpret otolith images and converted
    ImageNet pre-trained parameters to the trained CNN model through transfer learning.
    The experimental outcomes showed that the model performed well and could be used
    to compare the accuracy of artificial experts. The model was unable to accurately
    predict the youngest fish age area, which resulted in low prediction accuracy
    for specific ages. c. Sex determination: For the identification of the sex of
    fish, biological methods were used in the past (Du et al., 2017, Yarmohammadi
    et al., 2017, Webb et al., 2019). These methods had high detection errors and
    caused fish trauma. The machine learning method for identifying fish sex does
    not rely on the quality or age of the fish, but rather on the relative morphological
    parameters of the fish. In parallel, machine vision technology can effectively
    obtain the morphological parameters of the fish. For these reasons, the method
    of combining machine vision and machine learning can obviously identify the sex
    of fish in an effective manner (Barulin, 2017). Barulin (2019) conducted a study
    on Sex identification of starlet sturgeon based on based on scute structure using
    Boruta algorithm/Random forest algorithm. The experimental results showed that
    this approach performs well, and they also offer a positive outlook for using
    AI to determine a species sex. 4. Use of AI in fish feeding. The cost of feeding
    fish accounts for 40–50 % of the total operational cost of aquaculture (Ogunlela
    and Adebayo, 2016), while 60 % of the feed that is dispensed into the aquarium
    becomes particulates (Srivastava and Liu, 2015). These accumulated particles pollute
    the water, which uses oxygen to break them down and release ammonia, nitrogen,
    and other noxious substances that can stunt the growth of fish. While measuring
    the amount of fish feed intake remains a significant challenge, the amount of
    feed dispensed to match fish appetite levels plays a significant role in increasing
    fish productivity. AI can also help to optimize feeding of fish and AI software
    can calculate the ideal feeding schedule and serving size. This could improve
    feed use, reduce waste, and foster fish growth and health. One important area
    where AI can have a significant impact on fish behaviour, appetite, and growth
    rates is aquaculture feeding optimization. By taking into account elements like
    water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and the nutritional content of feed,
    AI may be used to develop prediction models that determine the ideal feeding schedule
    and quantity for a certain fish population. Through waste and the chance of overfeeding,
    this can have a detrimental effect on the environment by resulting in contaminated
    water. By reading the sensors in real-time, an optimal model for artificial intelligence
    may be employed to determine the shrimp biomass and determine the proper amount
    (Chen et al., 2022). AI can also be used to assess fish behaviour and hunger in
    real-time in addition to optimising feeding schedules. It has been reported that
    cameras and sensors can be used to keep an eye on activities like feeding, swimming,
    and other signs of stress or hunger (Barreto et al., 2022). Fish will then receive
    the ideal quantity of nutrition to support their growth and development by using
    this information to change feeding schedules and amounts in real-time (Lafont
    et al., 2022). Studies have reported that AI can also be used to develop individualised
    feeding plans for each fish, taking into account their genetic make-up, age, and
    body weight (Reyed, 2023). Precision aquaculture is a method for maximising growth
    rates and minimising the overall environmental effect of aquaculture operations
    (O''Donncha and Grant, 2019). Using AI for feeding optimization can significantly
    increase fish growth rates, appetite, and behaviour in aquaculture while lowering
    waste and having a minimally detrimental environmental impact (Føre et al., 2018).
    5. Use of AI in promoting growth rates. The optimal temperature for the growth
    of fish varies, depends on the species of fish reared. Maintenance of the optimal
    temperature, fish farmers can promote faster growth rates and larger fish (Uddin
    et al., 2022). However, if the temperature rises too high or too low, it can negatively
    impact growth rates (Sivri et al., 2007). There are several ways in which growth
    rates, aquaculture, and AI are interconnected. Foremost factor is to monitor growth
    rate. The growth rates of these organisms are critical to the success of the aquaculture
    industry. AI can be used to monitor and manage the growth rates of these organisms,
    ensuring optimal conditions for growth and maximizing production. In the current
    era modern and innovative and technical instrumental devices are using stereoscopic
    observations to measure the size, observe the shape, position and behaviour of
    fish and shrimps. It has been reported that “Sonar cameras” converts sound echoes
    into video images to use them in dark or turbid environments (Li et al., 2020).
    Studies have reported that water quality can be monitored in three dimensional
    in cages and large tanks by using autonomous vehicles that lift and lowers the
    sensor to develop 3-D data profiles (Edan et al., 2009). Whereas indoor recirculatory
    aquaculture system and underwater net-pen production environment were found more
    stable (Using sonar to help farmers solve the biomass problem, 2022). Moreover,
    AI can be used to develop predictive models that can forecast the growth rates
    of aquatic organisms (Hmoud Al-Adhaileh & Waselallah Alsaade, 2021). To effectively
    estimate growth rates, these models can take into account a variety of environmental
    variables, including water temperature, oxygen concentrations, and nutrition availability
    (Ansari et al., 2021). This can help farmers in reducing waste and streamlining
    their production processes. Based on a fish species'' development rate, water
    temperature, and other environmental conditions, a prediction model can be used
    to establish the ideal feeding rate for that species (Ghandar et al., 2021). In
    order to help farmers organise their operations more efficiently, the model may
    also forecast the anticipated yield and the date of harvest. Predictive models
    can not only increase manufacturing efficiency but also help stop disease outbreaks.
    Predictive models can identify early indications of stress or disease in aquatic
    species through environmental monitoring, enabling farmers to take preventative
    action and lessen the effect on production (Bell et al., 2022). Predictive modelling
    is a useful tool for farmers who want to maximise output while minimising environmental
    effect since it can boost growth rates, efficiency, and sustainability in aquaculture
    (Das et al., 2022). Another study examined the use of AI to optimize feeding regimes
    for salmon. They use machine learning algorithms to develop personalized feeding
    programs based on individual fish characteristics, and were able to achieve significant
    improvements in growth rates and feed conversion ratios (Barreto et al., 2022).
    AI algorithms may create individualised feeding schedules that satisfy each fish''s
    unique nutritional needs and maximise growth rates by accessing data on feeding
    behaviour and development rates (Metcalfe, 2019). 6. Use of AI in sustainability,
    efficiency and behaviour of fish. Aquaculture has the potential to be a sustainable
    food supply, but it needs to be carefully managed to prevent harm to the environment.
    It has been reported that AI can be employed to keep an eye on environmental factors
    like water quality, fertiliser levels, waste reduction, and productivity (Krishnan
    et al., 2021). The use of AI in aquaculture has the potential to boost productivity,
    promote sustainability, reduce disease outbreaks, and improve growth rates, making
    aquaculture a more viable and long-term source of food (Mandal and Ghosh, 2023).
    Fish feeding habits, activity levels, and social relationships can all be affected
    by temperature conditions. Certain fish species have been found to grow more aggressive
    in warmer temperatures. Some fish species are known to become more aggressive
    in warmer temperatures. Well-known examples are tilapia, a common freshwater fish
    raised for food that has been demonstrated to become more aggressive in warmer
    temperatures. This is thought to be caused by changes in their metabolism, which
    can have an impact on how they behave. Popular sport fish, largemouth bass have
    been seen to become more hostile in warmer water temperatures. This is assumed
    to be caused by changes in their food habits and increased metabolic activity.
    The behavior of various fish species in response to temperature changes is a fascinating
    area of study. Bluegills, a popular freshwater sunfish, exhibit increased aggression
    in warmer water likely due to heightened competition for resources such as food
    and habitat (Barber, 2007). Similarly, Atlantic salmon have been found to become
    more aggressive in warmer climates, which can lead to higher stress levels and
    increased succeptibility to diseases, potentially impacting their overall health
    and productivity (Portz et al., 2006, Svenning et al., 2022).). Coldwater fish
    called yellow perch have been seen to grow more aggressive in warmer weather (Stasko
    et al., 2012). Their feeding habits may vary as a result, and there may be more
    competition for few resources. Depending on the species and the particular environmental
    factors, the effect of rising temperatures on fish aggression may differ. Nonetheless,
    it is widely acknowledged that variations in water temperature can significantly
    affect fish behaviour as well as their general health and wellbeing. Several fish
    species become less active as a result of their slowed metabolisms and the need
    to conserve energy to keep their bodies warm in colder climates (Reeve et al.,
    2022). Which include a few fish species that slowdown in cooler weather (Power
    et al., 1999). Coldwater fish like trout become less active when the temperature
    drops. In order to save energy, they are known to seek out warmer water, such
    as at the surface or close to a warm tributary''s outflow (Heggenes et al., 2021).
    Another fish species that slows down in cooler weather is the catfish. As the
    water temperature is more consistent and they can preserve energy, they are known
    to go to deeper parts of a body of water. Freshwater fish with a wide tolerance
    for temperature variation include carp. However, they are known to become less
    active in colder temperatures and will often move to deeper areas of a body of
    water to conserve energy (Ficke et al., 2007). Pike are a type of predatory fishes
    that slowdown in cooler weather. They are known to travel to warmer water in deeper
    parts of a body of water where they can conserve energy. Besides, popular sport
    fish, walleye, become less active in cooler weather. In order to preserve energy,
    they are known to seek out warmer water, for example, close to a warm tributary''s
    outflow. This shows that depending on the species and the particular environmental
    conditions, the effects of cooler temperatures on fish activity might differ (Huntingford
    et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it is widely acknowledged that variations in water
    temperature can significantly affect fish behaviour as well as their general health
    and wellbeing. Consequently, fish producers can encourage healthy behaviours that
    produce fish with better health by maximising the temperature circumstances (Craig
    et al., 2017). The Tokyo-based Umitron Corporation created the Umitron''s system,
    a system for tracking swimmer behaviour, using AI technology. This system makes
    decisions about when and how much feed should be supplied in each fish cage based
    on real-time observation of swimming behaviour. This approach significantly reduces
    trash production, transportation and logistical needs compared to daily feeding
    as well as feed transformation efficiency. The fish are sold under the name “AI
    Sumagastsuo” in Tokyo (Umitron launches feed optimisation and mortality estimation
    software, 2022). 7. Use of AI in reproduction The study of reproductive mechanisms
    is crucial across various organisms, including, humans, animals, and plants, each
    with unique reproductive processes. Temperature plays a significant role in fish
    reproduction as certain species require specific temperature ranges for successful
    spawning. Fishermen can encourage effective reproduction and increase the number
    of fish in their farm by adjusting the temperature conditions. Freshwater or saltwater
    habitats can be used for aquaculture, which can use a variety of techniques include
    tank-based systems, net-pen systems, and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.
    It has been studied that in aquaculture, AI can be used to enhance feeding and
    water quality, regulate fish populations, and prevent disease outbreaks (Prapti
    et al., 2022). Research on reproduction can be used in aquaculture to create fresh
    breeding plans that will boost the wellbeing and output of populations of farmed
    fish. In addition, there have been several studies exploring the use of AI for
    the management of fish reproduction. For example, one of the studies developed
    a predictive model to identify the optimal conditions for egg production in striped
    bass. Moreover, previous literature suggests that the use of AI in aquaculture
    has significant potential to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the
    industry. By enabling more effective management of fish reproduction, feeding,
    and growth (Mustapha et al., 2021), AI can lead to improved fish health and well-being,
    as well as increased productivity and profitability for fish farmers (Ubina and
    Cheng, 2022, Khan et al., 2018). 8. Use of AI in breeding programs. Based on genomic
    data, AI can be used to create prediction models of fish performance, allowing
    for more effective and focused breeding programmes for qualities like disease
    resistance and growth rate. AI systems may find genetic differences associated
    with particular features by analysing vast amounts of genomic data, and they can
    then utilise this knowledge to create prediction models of fish performance (Dixit
    et al., 2023). The performance of various fish populations under various environmental
    situations may thus be predicted using these models, as well as the top candidates
    for breeding to achieve particular objectives like disease resistance or growth
    rate. AI enables breeding operations to be more targeted and effective, which
    saves time and money while achieving desired features. By increasing the productivity
    and sustainability of fish populations, this can have a large positive impact
    on aquaculture and fisheries management (Mandal and Ghosh, 2023). Therefore, the
    use of AI and breeding programmes together has great potential to advance the
    fields of aquaculture and fisheries management as well as genetic quality and
    performance of fish populations. 9. Use of AI in conservation genetics. AI can
    be used to analyze genetic data from endangered or threatened fish species, enabling
    better understanding of their genetic diversity and potential for conservation.
    The conservation of these species is important for maintaining healthy aquatic
    ecosystems and preserving the biodiversity of our planet. Endangered or threatened
    fish species face many challenges, including overfishing, habitat loss, pollution,
    and climate change. In order to overcome these problems, conservation genetics
    can play a crucial role in understanding and addressing these challenges. Analysis
    of genetic data using AI algorithms, researchers can identify distinct populations
    within a species, as well as the genetic diversity within and among these populations
    (Vilhekar and Rawekar, 2024).This information can be used to develop more effective
    conservation strategies, such as targeting conservation efforts to areas with
    high genetic diversity or prioritizing the protection of distinct populations
    that may be more vulnerable to extinction (Vilhekar and Rawekar, 2024). Researchers
    can use AI to track alterations in the genetic diversity of fish populations that
    are at danger of extinction. They can also evaluate the success of conservation
    methods and spot possible dangers to the long-term survival of a species by monitoring
    changes in genetic diversity. AI can also assist researchers in finding genetic
    markers linked to characteristics like disease resistance or successful reproduction
    that are crucial for the survival and procreation of fish species (Palaiokostas,
    2021).. Using this knowledge, breeding strategies may be created that put an emphasis
    on maintaining certain qualities and support the species long-term survival. In
    general, the application of AI to conservation genetics can assist us in understanding
    and preserving fish species that are in danger of extinction and are crucial to
    the health of our aquatic ecosystems and the lives of those who depend on them.
    Conservation genetics is an important field that aims to understand and preserve
    the genetic diversity of endangered or threatened species. AI can be a valuable
    tool in this field, as it can help researchers analyze large amounts of genetic
    data more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods (Xu et al., 2021).
    By analyzing genetic data using AI algorithms, researchers can identify patterns
    of genetic diversity within a species, such as the presence of unique or rare
    alleles. This information can then be used to develop effective conservation strategies,
    such as targeted breeding programs or the establishment of protected habitats.
    Additionally, AI can help researchers identify potential threats to the genetic
    diversity of endangered species, such as the introduction of invasive species
    or habitat destruction (Branco et al., 2023). By identifying these threats early
    on, conservationists can take action to mitigate their impact and preserve the
    genetic diversity of vulnerable species. Overall, the use of AI in conservation
    genetics has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of endangered
    and threatened species and help ensure their long-term survival. Overall, AI holds
    the promise of revolutionising the research of fish genomes and opening up new
    possibilities for aquaculture, fishery management, and environmental conservation.
    The ethical ramifications of genetic tools based on AI, though, are also a source
    of worry, and it''s important to make sure they''re used sustainably and responsibly.
    As a result, it''s critical to carefully weigh the possible advantages and disadvantages
    of AI in fish genome analysis and to make sure it''s applied in a way that''s
    advantageous to both people and the environment. Hence, AI has the potential to
    change the aquaculture sector by enabling more profitable, efficient, and sustainable
    production techniques. Yet, there are also worries about the price and availability
    of AI technology, as well as potential moral dilemmas with the treatment of animals
    and the environment. To ensure that AI is utilised responsibly and sustainably,
    it is crucial to thoroughly weigh the potential advantages and hazards of its
    usage in aquaculture. 10. Use of AI in fish genome. AI has the potential to revolutionise
    the study of fish genomes by enabling a speedier and more precise analysis of
    genetic data and accelerating the development of new genetic tools for use in
    aquaculture and fisheries management (Song et al., 2023). Fish genome research
    is one area where AI has showed considerable potential (Ditria et al., 2022).
    AI can assist researchers in swiftly and accurately analysing enormous amounts
    of genetic data due to the growing complexity of data analysis techniques and
    the availability of genomic data (De Alwis et al., 2022). In order to detect genetic
    variations and comprehend the activities of particular genes, it can be incredibly
    helpful for AI algorithms to learn from enormous amounts of data in order to recognise
    patterns and make predictions. By detecting desirable genetic features and enabling
    the selection of the best candidates for breeding, AI can assist in aquaculture
    and fisheries management to improve the breeding of fish species. By examining
    genetic diversity and locating genetic markers that can be used to follow fish
    movements and population changes, it can also assist in the monitoring of fish
    populations. AI can also be utilised to create novel genetic tools that can be
    used to improve the health and production of fish, such as gene editing technology
    (Rasal and Sundaray, 2020). AI has the potential to significantly advance the
    study of fish genomes, leading to important breakthroughs in aquaculture and fisheries
    management. Some of the potential applications of AI in fish genome analysis include:
    11. Use of AI in genome sequencing and editing. Large volumes of genomic data
    may be analysed using AI, allowing for quicker and more precise genome sequencing
    and assembly. AI can speed up the process of genome sequencing, a critical tool
    for determining the genetic makeup of fish species (Ruppert et al., 2019). AI
    algorithms can assist researchers in finding the most pertinent and instructive
    regions of the genome and speed up the synthesis of high-quality genome sequences
    by processing enormous amounts of genomic data. This can be very advantageous
    for fish breeding and selection in aquaculture. For instance, researchers can
    find desired features like disease resistance, rapid growth, and environmental
    adaptation by sequencing the genomes of several fish populations and examining
    genetic variants. Researchers can choose the best candidates for breeding with
    the use of AI, which can make the process much quicker and more precise than conventional
    techniques (Xue et al., 2023). This will ultimately increase the productivity
    and sustainability of aquaculture operations. In order to advance the research
    of fish genomes and enhance aquaculture techniques, AI and genome sequencing hold
    immense potential. In order to change fish genomes more effectively and precisely
    for purposes like increased growth and disease resistance, AI can be used to design
    and refine genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 (Ferdous et al., 2022).
    The science of genome editing, which makes use of instruments like CRISPR-Cas9,
    holds great promise for enhancing features in fish species including disease resistance
    and growth (Houston et al., 2020). Unfortunately, developing and refining genome
    editing technologies can take a lot of time and resources. By anticipating the
    most efficient target areas for genome editing and refining the CRISPR-Cas9 system''s
    design for optimum effectiveness and precision, AI can speed up this process (Jones
    and Wilson, 2022). AI systems can discover potential off-target effects and reduce
    the danger of unintentional modifications to the genome by evaluating vast volumes
    of genetic data. Researchers can create more effective and precise genome editing
    tools for use in aquaculture and fisheries management with the aid of AI. For
    instance, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to change existing features to better fit changing
    environmental conditions or to introduce desired genetic traits such as disease
    resistance or increased growth into fish populations (Roy et al., 2022). Overall,
    the development of new genetic tools and interventions that can improve the health
    and resilience of fish populations is made possible by the combination of AI and
    genome editing technologies, which has enormous potential for improving the productivity
    and sustainability of aquaculture and fisheries management. Major challenges One
    problem is the absence of clear data and data sharing guidelines. A large amount
    of high-quality data is required to develop effective AI models and algorithms.
    There is currently a lack of common data formats and protocols to facilitate data
    sharing across different aquaculture enterprises and research institutions. This
    limits the application of AI in aquaculture and creates difficulties in collecting
    and analysing large amounts of data. Mustapha et al. (2021) reported that, there
    are various limitations and challenges that may hinder the extensive adoption
    of AI in aquaculture. One of them is security concerns associated with many levels
    of the interconnected systems and networks that will be required. It requires
    complex data acquisition to convert it into meaningfully capture the complexity
    and biological interactions found in many production systems. Deep learning AI
    requires large amounts of training data, which is typically difficult to come
    by. For some applications, this is further compounded by the turbidity and bio-fouling
    associated with many culture systems. Finally, cost-benefit considerations will
    largely determine the extent and pace of AI adoption. But the long term trends
    for adoption are increasingly apparent. In order to develop effective AI algorithms
    and models, large amounts of high-quality data are required. However, there is
    currently a lack of standardized data formats and protocols for sharing data across
    different aquaculture operations and research institutions. This makes it difficult
    to collect and analyze large amounts of data, and limits the effectiveness of
    AI in aquaculture. Aquaculture operations involve a wide range of variables, such
    as water quality, temperature, and feed inputs, that can interact in complex ways
    to affect fish health and growth. Developing AI algorithms and models that can
    effectively capture and analyze these complex interactions is a major challenge
    that will require continued research and development. Developing and implementing
    AI systems in aquaculture can be expensive, particularly for smaller-scale operations.
    There may be a need for investment in infrastructure and technology to support
    the implementation of AI in aquaculture. As AI systems rely on large amounts of
    sensitive data, there is a need to ensure that data is securely stored and transmitted,
    and that data privacy is maintained. Skill and knowledge gaps Data analysis, software
    development, and aquaculture domain knowledge are just a few of the abilities
    needed to build and implement AI systems in aquaculture. Programs for education
    and training might be required to fill in skill and knowledge gaps. These challenges
    need to be addressed if aquaculture is to completely benefit from AI. By creating
    effective AI models and algorithms, addressing concerns with data sharing, complexity,
    cost, privacy, and data security, AI can help aquaculture operations become more
    sustainable and efficient while also providing a stable and secure supply of high-quality
    seafood for the growing global population. It can also help close skill and knowledge
    gaps. Another issue is the creation of sophisticated AI models and algorithms
    that can account for the intricate and dynamic structure of aquaculture systems.
    A few of the several variables that can interact intimately in aquaculture operations
    to affect fish health and growth are temperature, feed inputs, and water quality.
    It will take ongoing research and development to create AI models and algorithms
    that can successfully record and evaluate these intricate interactions. Conclusion
    Because AI makes it possible to regulate fish growth, feeding, and reproduction
    more effectively and over the long term, the aquaculture industry could undergo
    a total transformation. AI can improve decision-making speed and accuracy, decrease
    the need for antibiotics, and lower the negative environmental effects of aquaculture
    operations. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be solved before
    aquaculture can completely benefit from AI. Some of them include the lack of standardized
    data and data communication protocols, as well as the need for advanced AI models
    and algorithms that can account for the complex and dynamic nature of aquaculture
    systems. Notwithstanding these challenges, the future of aquaculture AI looks
    bright. The aquaculture industry will likely see an increase in the use of AI
    as technology grows. Thanks to AI, fish production can be managed more effectively
    and sustainably, providing a consistent and safe supply of premium seafood for
    the world''s growing population. Future recommendations Despite these difficulties,
    aquaculture AI has a promising future. The advancements in sensor technology and
    data collection techniques have made it easier to collect and share high-quality
    data. Additionally, the progress in machine learning and deep learning algorithms
    allows for more sophisticated analysis of large datasets. As these technologies
    continue to evolve in the aquaculture sector, AI is expected to play a more significant
    role in the effective and sustainable management of fish production, as well as
    in improving the overall health and well-being of farmed fish. The following suggestions
    for upcoming research and development will help aquaculture fully reap the potential
    advantages of AI: Standardization of data and data sharing protocols Standardized
    data formats and protocols must be established in order to facilitate data exchange
    among various aquaculture companies and research institutes. This will make it
    possible to gather and evaluate vast volumes of high-quality data and will speed
    up the creation of efficient AI models and algorithms. AI algorithms and models
    need to be developed that can effectively capture and analyze the complex interactions
    between variables in aquaculture operations, such as water quality, temperature,
    and feed inputs. AI systems need to be integrated with existing aquaculture technologies,
    such as sensors and cameras, to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making.
    There is a need to develop low-cost AI systems that are accessible to smaller-scale
    aquaculture operations, and that can help to improve the efficiency and sustainability
    of these operations. AI can be used to develop predictive models that can forecast
    fish growth, feed requirements, and disease outbreaks, enabling more effective
    and efficient management of aquaculture operations. Collaboration between the
    aquaculture industry and academia can help to bridge skill and knowledge gaps,
    and facilitate the development and implementation of AI systems in aquaculture.
    By addressing these recommendations, AI can help to improve the efficiency and
    sustainability of aquaculture operations, and ensure a reliable and secure source
    of high-quality seafood for the growing global population. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology.

    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron''s
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it’s budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology. Previous article

    System 1. Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor,
    aroma, and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany
    and Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical
    applications that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou
    et al., 2022), neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and
    potential benefits for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer
    prevention, menstrual health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016,
    Akhondzadeh et al., 2010, Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed
    to confirm its effectiveness and safety for specific medical conditions. It should
    be used in moderation and under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et
    al., 2011), but its cultivation is characterized by substantial manual labor,
    making it one of the world''s most expensive spices. This study addresses a significant
    research gap in the field, focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles
    et al., 2015) of saffron and the critical environmental factors that influence
    its development. The aim is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron
    production through IoT and addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation,
    which have been relatively understudied in existing literature. The two major
    analytical points are: 1. Optimizing Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding
    the specific environmental requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead
    to improved crop management practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and
    quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse
    cultivation provides more precise control over environmental factors such as light,
    temperature, and humidity, leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared
    to traditional open-field methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing
    research. The five major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering,
    leaf development, daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various
    factors, which have been deduced and summarized from different works as below
    1.1. Temperature Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud
    growth during the first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures,
    but flowering commenced shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005)
    found optimal floral development within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though
    exceeding 150 days resulted in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al.
    (2023) highlighted the crucial role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated
    that lowering the temperature to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions
    (23–27°C) was essential for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported
    by Wang et al. (2020), can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms
    to abort. Notably, their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers
    at all. Further research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal
    temperature fluctuations on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering
    followed by flower initiation in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached
    20°C. Conversely, prolonged hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn
    when temperatures dropped to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh
    et al. (2021) suggests that maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C
    and relative humidity of 65.71% for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient
    flower ontogenesis. However, for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019)
    found that 36 days of incubation at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective.
    Interestingly, both excessive and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting
    period have been linked to decreased saffron production and productivity, as noted
    by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally, chilling periods in December and January,
    with mean aerial temperatures around 2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful
    saffron flowering, according to the findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light
    intensity The role of light intensity in saffron cultivation remains somewhat
    enigmatic, particularly its impact on daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However,
    recent research by Chen et al. (2024) explored the effects of different light
    intensities and red/blue light combinations on saffron plants. Their findings
    suggest that a light intensity of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be
    optimal for maximizing stigma yield, quality, and nutrient content. On the other
    hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020) indicate that higher light intensities can
    compromise stigma yield and quality, despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis.
    Leveraging the wealth of knowledge obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based
    saffron system offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation
    by providing precise environmental control, data-driven insights, and adaptive
    management strategies. This integration of technology and scientific understanding
    holds great promise for advancing saffron production efficiency and sustainability
    in the future. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Technologies used The technologies
    that have been used in developing the prototype after considering all of the parameters
    are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller -The sensors used are the DHT11 and
    an LDR -Database management is handled using Google FireBase -The app environment
    was set up and developed using ReactJS Other technologies used by researchers
    in the same field have included Arduino UNOs which are generally more expensive
    than the ESP-32. They have also used separate air moisture and temperature while
    we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both these sensors as one and helps
    reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment. Each of them is explained in
    detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems on a-chip microcontrollers
    features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and is cost-efficient and less
    power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa LX7 dual-core The Tensilica
    Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor, or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor,
    which also has integrated antenna switches, power amplifiers, filters,low-noise
    receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management modules. ESP32 used is shown

    2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor consists
    of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit microprocessor which
    is used to output the temperature and humidity measurements as data which is serialized
    (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor The most common uses for photoresistors,
    also known as light-dependent resistors (LDR), are expected to discern the presence
    or absence of light or to gauge the power of the light. When the LDR sensor is
    exposed to light, the resistance reduces rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms,
    hinging on the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very elevated,
    often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential devices consisting of variable sensitivity
    depending on the wavelength of the input light. Although they are exploited in
    many applications, other gadgets like photodiodes and phototransistors frequently
    perform this light-sensing function. LDR Sensor used is shown in Fig. 3. Download

    (LDR Sensor). 2.1.4. Soil moisture sensor (under implementation) In our current
    prototype of the IoT-based saffron system, we are enhancing its suitability for
    outdoor cultivation conditions by incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition
    will enable real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter
    for optimizing saffron cultivation. By accurately assessing soil moisture content,
    our system can dynamically adjust irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron
    plants receive adequate hydration while preventing overwatering or drought stress.
    This proactive approach not only enhances plant health and productivity but also
    promotes water conservation and sustainability in saffron farming practices. With
    the integration of the soil moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers
    with a robust tool for efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation
    in outdoor settings. 2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored
    app development platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides
    tools to trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and
    create business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using
    Google Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting
    for up to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and
    Android app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with
    Firebase Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users
    and makes it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions.
    These features support email and password authentication, phone authentication,
    and access to Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete
    identity solution. Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free,
    cross-platform messaging app that allows businesses to send and receive messages
    on iOS, Android, and the web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL
    database, synchronization and storage of data between users can be done instantly
    between users. When the app is offline, it is still available because the device
    continues to connect to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash
    reporting tool called Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve
    security issues that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash
    analysis, developers can focus more on building features for their applications
    rather than managing and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance
    Monitoring Tools give developers information about the iOS and Android performance
    of their apps, allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing.
    When application performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android
    apps on multiple connected devices in a single operation. They can view results,
    including screenshots, logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS
    React is an open-source front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating
    user interfaces that are based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js
    or ReactJS. Meta (previously Facebook) and a group of independent programmers
    and businesses are responsible for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation
    for single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks
    like Next.js. React is only concerned with state management and presenting that
    information to the DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates
    the use of extra libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality.
    2.2. Application development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application
    is to display and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help
    to improve on-field work. The designing of the application is done such that it
    is easy for even a layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user
    experience is made by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white
    space and equal margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important
    for demonstrating the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward
    with our research, the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate
    the application''s performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness
    in practical on-field use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React
    JS, which is an open-source front-end JavaScript library used for developing user
    interfaces based on UI components. React can be exploited as a base in the development
    of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications The structure of the appis
    shown in Fig. 3 The application is synced with a real-time Firebase database,
    from which the app gets data simultaneously and displays it on its interface.
    Firebase web APIs (application programming interface) are used to communicate
    between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4 Download : Download high-res
    image (76KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. (App-Development Structure).
    The same server is also responsible for storing data for research and academic
    purposes. Download : Download high-res image (65KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. (Javascript code for DB insertion). The app is integrated with the
    sensors that need to be installed in the field and collects live data that the
    user can access through the app, unlike the existing apps that only have static
    elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data and the data that have
    been collected, the app compares the live data with the optimal data and helps
    farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield. This app currently focuses
    on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help farmers predict which crops
    will be beneficial based on the live conditions of the soil and field. This way,
    production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3. Interface The application interface

    This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based saffron monitoring
    and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment is conducted
    in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped with sensors
    for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture, is installed.
    These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental parameters
    crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured to
    log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization algorithms
    to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions based on saffron
    cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized experimental layout
    with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive optimization recommendations
    generated by the IoT-based system, while control groups do not receive any intervention.
    Throughout a predetermined validation period, environmental parameters and saffron
    growth stages are monitored and recorded. Data analysis focuses on evaluating
    the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based system in providing monitoring
    and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results suggest that the IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively monitors environmental
    parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations. Treatment groups
    receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron growth and
    development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy in enhancing
    saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the advancement
    of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating sustainable
    production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to further refine
    the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities to optimize saffron
    cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future work In the next
    phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into our existing IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition aims to automate irrigation
    by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the saffron cultivation plot. Our
    experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable pump, installing it in the
    cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water based on soil moisture sensor
    readings. We will develop control algorithms to activate the pump when soil moisture
    falls below a predetermined threshold and integrate pump control functionalities
    into our IoT system. Through a series of experiments, we will validate the effectiveness
    of the integrated pump in promoting saffron growth and yield compared to manual
    irrigation methods. By automating irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to
    improve resource efficiency, enhance crop quality, and increase saffron productivity.
    5. Results and discussions This study posits the conceptualization and realization
    of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based application designed for the surveillance
    and regulation of pivotal agronomic parameters, encompassing variables such as
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, and luminance levels. The overarching
    objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges while concurrently augmenting the
    cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant application, characterized by
    its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors the capacity to bolster the
    qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops. A salient hallmark of this
    application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived data, thus serving
    as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers for investigative
    and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently adaptable,
    affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation to the
    cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its current
    purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful Luminous
    intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for the optimum
    range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The paramount aim
    of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural methodologies
    into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious economization
    of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community. A plausible
    extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies within a
    controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    years, the urgent need to address climate change and its impact on the environment
    has become increasingly evident [1]. As one of the most significant contributors
    to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the agricultural sector has a crucial role
    to play in mitigating climate change and transitioning towards a more sustainable
    future. In this line, the direct emissions of GHGs from agriculture account for
    383 Mt CO2-eq of GHG in 2020, representing 11% of total European Union (EU) emissions
    [2]. The agricultural sector also faces a range of challenges in relation to climate
    change, including increased frequency of extreme weather events, water scarcity,
    soil degradation and changing patterns of pests and diseases [3]. These challenges
    not only threaten food security and rural development but also contribute to the
    overall carbon footprint of the agricultural sector. In this context, low carbon
    certifications have recently emerged as an effective tool to incentivize and recognize
    agricultural practices that minimize carbon emissions and promote sustainable
    farming techniques [[4], [5], [6]]. These certifications provide a framework for
    farmers and agricultural producers to measure, reduce, and offset their carbon
    footprint, while also ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the
    supply chain. They can be broadly categorized into voluntary, compulsory or hybrid
    types, each serving distinct purposes in the global transition towards a low-carbon
    economy. Through the adoption of low carbon certifications, agricultural producers
    have the opportunity to incorporate low-carbon and climate-smart practices like
    precision farming, conservation agriculture, crop rotation and diversification,
    cover cropping, renewable energy integration and enhanced livestock management
    [5,7]. These practices not only contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and
    resource inputs but also bolster resilience and improve overall productivity.
    Low carbon certifications offer several benefits to farmers and agricultural producers
    [4,8]. In this context, they provide a competitive edge in the market by meeting
    the growing consumer demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products. Consumers
    are increasingly seeking assurance that the products they purchase are produced
    in a manner that minimizes environmental impact. Low carbon certifications provide
    this assurance, enabling producers to access premium markets, strengthen their
    brand reputation as well as to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability
    and corporate social responsibility. In addition to consumer demand and corporate
    responsibility, low carbon certifications also align with global sustainability
    goals and international commitments such as the 2015 Paris Agreement [9,10]. By
    embracing low carbon certifications, agricultural producers contribute to these
    global efforts, demonstrate their dedication to climate action, and support the
    transition to a low-carbon economy. In the European context, a few low carbon
    certification systems have been recently established and have gained prominence
    within the agricultural sector as integral components of GHG emissions reduction,
    carbon sequestration and sustainable farming practices [4,11]. One noteworthy
    voluntary certification system is the “Label Bas Carbone” (Low Carbon Label) in
    France, established and financially supported by public entities and official
    authorities to fulfil the objectives of reducing GHG emissions at the national
    level by 2050 in five carbon-intensive sectors (agriculture, forests, buildings,
    transportation and marine) [12]. Similarly, the LEAF (Linking Environment and
    Farming) Marque Standard operates across Europe, emphasizing Integrated Farm Management
    (IFM) principles [13]. IFM principles refer to nine different sections aiming
    to optimize the use of resources, promote biodiversity, and enhance soil health.
    The LEAF certification system encourages farmers to embrace holistic approaches
    that consider environmental, economic, and social aspects of their operations.
    Another notable low carbon initiative is “Wineries for Climate Protection (WfCP)\"
    developed by the Spanish Wine Federation particularly focusing on the viticulture
    sector [14]. WfCP encourages wineries to implement energy-efficient technologies,
    adopt organic farming methods, and explore innovative approaches to vineyard management
    that contribute to lower carbon footprints. However, to the best of our knowledge,
    the existing low carbon certification systems related to agriculture face challenges
    associated with the limitations of Tier 1 and Tier 2 methodologies that are applied
    for GHG accounting, reporting and verifying the degree of carbon reduction achieved.
    Tier 1 methods typically involve the use of default emission factors and generic
    coefficients, which lack precision and fail to account for specific regional or
    farm-level variations. While Tier 2 methodologies offer a more tailored approach
    with greater accuracy, the lack of field measurements and up-to-date information
    at the farm level can introduce uncertainties and inaccuracies in GHG calculations.
    To this end, the aim of the current study is to provide an integrated framework
    for low carbon certification of agricultural production based on the most-detailed
    Tier 3 approach developed under the ClimaMED EU LIFE project to capture and monitor
    all mitigation activities implemented on 15 pilot farms in the Mediterranean region
    [15]. In this line, several innovative on-site data collection and analysis technologies
    based on real-time GHG measurements via an Internet of Things (IoT) telemetry
    reporting network at the farm level are incorporated. The main purpose of this
    certification system is to provide a comparable advantage for Med-based cultivation
    products and upgrade their position in the market. By adopting a more accurate,
    standardized and site-specific approach, the proposed framework seeks to overcome
    the challenges posed by the current methodologies and contribute to the refinement
    and advancement of low carbon certification systems in the agricultural sector.
    2. integrated certification methodology for agricultural products 2.1. Establishment
    of a low carbon certification system – proposed guidelines The proposed low-carbon/GHG
    reduction certification system for agricultural products is built upon an extended
    modification of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle management method, a common
    operating principle of ISO''s management system standards [[16], [17], [18]].
    The PDCA cycle usually begins with the planning phase, where clear goals and objectives
    are set based on the requirements of sustainable agriculture and relevant certification
    standards (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (525KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Proposed low-carbon/GHG reduction certification system
    for agricultural products built upon an extended modification of the Plan-Do-Check-Act
    (PDCA) cycle management method. This phase involves assessing the farm''s current
    practices, identifying areas for improvement i.e. hot spots, and developing action
    plans to address those areas. In the “Do” phase, the action plans are implemented,
    and the recommended sustainable practices and management strategies are put into
    action. This may include adopting resource-efficient technologies, implementing
    sustainable agriculture techniques, and promoting biodiversity conservation. The
    “Check” phase involves monitoring and evaluating the implemented practices to
    measure their effectiveness in achieving the desired outcomes. Based on the evaluation
    results, the “Act” phase involves making informed decisions and taking corrective
    actions if necessary to improve performance and meet the established goals. This
    includes adjusting management practices, revising action plans, and implementing
    necessary changes to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with certification
    requirements. Through the PDCA cycle, the proposed certification system promotes
    a holistic and iterative approach to sustainable agriculture, encouraging farmers
    to actively engage in self-assessment, implementation, and continuous improvement
    of their practices. It provides a structured framework for minimizing environmental
    impacts and meeting the demands of environmentally conscious consumers and market
    requirements. In this context, ISO/IEC 17067:2013, as a foundational standard
    for conformity assessment, provides a set of principles and requirements applicable
    to the proposed certification system and establishes a solid framework for the
    consistent application of criteria and the transparent communication of certification
    outcomes [19]. As such, the integration of the aforementioned ISO standard within
    the domain of the proposed low carbon certification system fortifies its credibility,
    consistency, and international recognition. The proposed six-stage low carbon
    product certificate is voluntary and can be available for Med-based agricultural
    products (5 categories in total) namely, olives, cereals, pistachios, grapes and
    vegetables for which their field cultivation and production is monitored in the
    timeframe of the ClimaMED project [15]. As such, the low carbon certificate is
    initially issued (but not limited) to the cultivations (15 pilot fields in total)
    of the aforementioned EU project, while the certification procedure involves clear
    targets and can be easily adaptable to any similar Med-based cultivation products.
    The certificate is available to products, for which their cultivation results
    in substantially lower CO2 emissions (carbon footprint) compared to their baseline
    established conditions. The proposed integrated framework for low carbon certification
    of agricultural production based on field GHG measurements is graphically presented
    per stage of the certification procedure in Fig. 2 and is in-depth presented and
    discussed in the following section. Download : Download high-res image (854KB)

    low carbon product certification system proposed and its timeline based on ClimaMED
    LIFE project activities. 2.2. Low carbon certification system stages The stages
    leading up to low carbon certification involve thorough planning, adoption of
    sustainable practices, and a conscientious effort to reduce carbon footprint at
    farm level. This initial phase (prior to certification) serves as foundation by
    setting the requirements and strategic planning for farmers to align their agricultural
    production with stringent low carbon standards [20]. Post-certification phase
    marks the continuation of this commitment to low carbon excellence as well as
    to a sustained effort to uphold the standards. The certification systems necessitate
    the accreditation of third parties, aligning with standards such as ISO 14064:2006
    and14065:2013 for GHG quantification/reporting and activities accreditation, UNFCCC-CDM
    accreditation or ASI – FSC Certification Body status [11]. Eligible entities,
    after achieving certification, embark on a carbon reduction and sequestration
    path marked by ongoing improvements, adaptation to evolving standards, and a perpetual
    dedication to sustainable agricultural practices. 2.2.1. Prior to certification
    2.2.1.1. Stage 1: application/approval and setting of baseline conditions In this
    stage, public entities, professional organizations and accreditation bodies are
    responsible for approving the authorization of the applicant farmer. Prior to
    approval, the public bodies, authorities and legal entities guarantee that the
    applicant farmer/land owner meets all the requirements/eligibility criteria necessary
    for possible certification of the cultivated products. These comprise the conditions
    and regulations that define the eligibility criteria for application, along with
    the administrative requirements, obligations, and limitations pertaining to enrollment
    in the context of low carbon certification. Eligibility criteria/Requirements.
    - The cultivations concerned include the five Med-based products: i) Olives, ii)
    Pistachios, iii) Grapes, iv) Cereals, v) Vegetables investigated during the ClimaMED
    project. - The farm is located in the Mediterranean region - The land must have
    been under cultivation for a minimum of 10 years in order to exclude recently
    converted native forest to cropland. - Willingness of farmer to participate and
    implement proposed low GHG emission and carbon sequestration practices - The fertilization
    program followed in the cultivation (annual application of manure/compost) remains
    strictly below the regulatory threshold of 170 kg organic N/ha [21]. In the case
    of biochar addition to soil, maximum thresholds for heavy metals and PAHs concentrations
    must not be exceeded based on the recent EU-Fertilizing. Products Regulation EU
    2019/1009 [22]. - The orchards for fruit crops must be permanently grassed over
    at least 50% of their surface. Other eligibility criteria may include: size of
    farm (<5 ha or ≥ 5 ha), whether the farmer is the owner or tenant/operator of
    the cultivation (legal control over the land), the inclusion of other crops, plant
    density, type of land surface such as arable land, viticulture, permanent grassland,
    land conversion e.g. from grassland to arable land and others. After the approval
    of the application, sufficient information is made available to the accreditation
    bodies or a third party (e.g. independent consultant) about current cultivation
    practices (Definition of Background – Baseline conditions). In this context, an
    on-site carbon audit is performed in order to assess GHG emissions and identify
    actionable strategies for mitigating GHG emissions and promoting carbon sequestration
    at the farm. To ensure different degrees of transparency and adoption, these baseline
    conditions could be set at. - individual farm level, based on previous monitoring
    data (e.g. ClimaMED project results, historical farm records). This may be based
    on average of a number of years (at least 3). In case of crop rotation, more years
    are required to ensure data reliability and consistency. - an average of “similar”
    Med products (i.e. based on sector, region, size). - the available national average
    emissions of the same product types from other countries with similar characteristics.
    Existing inputs (composts, fertilizers, agrochemicals etc.) and cultivation practices
    are recorded in detail. Based on the aforementioned field inventory, the baseline
    Carbon footprint (in terms of 100-year Global Warming Potential in kg CO2-eq)
    of the Med cultivation product is calculated from “cradle to farm gate” using
    the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology according to internationally recognized
    standards [[23], [24], [25]]. For uniformity, simplicity and less cost, open-source
    carbon footprint tools such as (Solagro, openLCA, Cool Farm Tool, CCalc, CAP’2ER,
    AgRE Calc, FaST or other equivalents) can be used to calculate emissions based
    on the whole farm system [26]. This stage will allow identifying local GHG emission
    hot-spots and their sources (e.g. extensive use of agrochemicals, manure addition,
    burning of agricultural wastes, livestock, fuel and electricity used). The low
    carbon certification process often requires farmers to provide a set of supporting
    documents to substantiate their commitment to sustainable and environmentally
    responsible agricultural practices. These documents serve as evidence of compliance
    with the certification criteria and help certification bodies assess the overall
    environmental performance of the farming operations. The supporting documents
    requested by farmers during the low carbon certification system can include mandatory
    or optional elements such as. i) Commitment: Commitments signed by each farmer
    or farm operating manager, and where applicable giving the applicant a mandate
    to obtain the low-carbon certificate for the Med-based cultivation product. The
    farmer commits, starting from the date of application, to apply practices in compliance
    with the certification standards and any subsequent amendments. ii) Farm Map:
    Mapping of the Med cultivation showing the exact location of the farm and specifying
    the current use of the land. This can include aerial photograph or other relevant
    public document from the land registration bureau/cadastral office. This document
    is also used to define the suitable area for the installation of the equipment
    (e.g. LiDAR devices, meteorological stations) and thus must be up to date i.e.
    at least less than a year old. iii) Compliance with current policy: Compliance
    with the latest Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [27], National Action Plans [28]
    and European Organic Livestock Standards [29,30]. For example, document proving
    compliance with the organic nitrogen fertilization [31], pesticide application,
    and treatment handling and storage [28]. iv) Health status of livestock: A fact
    sheet validated by an official veterinarian ensuring that the farm animals are
    in good health and there is an effective health care program in operation. 2.2.1.2.
    Stage 2: definition of carbon reduction targets – development of a Carbon Reduction
    Management Plan/planning actions In this stage, the carbon reduction targets are
    set for the cultivation product based on the baseline conditions identified in
    Stage 1 and the average CO2 emissions per product obtained from literature and
    EU project results [15]. The public entities, professional organizations and accreditation
    bodies are responsible for selecting feasible targets for each specific product
    case and proposing efficacious reduction actions for each cultivation based on
    two scenarios. Specified individual reference scenario: carrying out an individual
    diagnosis for each of the farms involved in the project, with an LCA-based/carbon
    footprint tool, at the time or at most 4 years before the farm enters the certification
    procedure. A corrective factor can be applied to the carbon intensities of the
    specified reference scenario in order to remove the effect of an exceptional year
    (e.g. low yield, extreme climate conditions) on the results. This option may refer
    to a “green certificate” which proves that the cultivation product has generated
    20% (at least) lower carbon emissions compared to baseline levels identified in
    Stage 1. General reference scenario: in the case of an on-site farm carbon audit
    that lacks crucial input data. In this case, reference is established by production
    system and by large geographical area. A 10% carbon reduction target is applied
    in the case of a general reference scenario. This option may refer to a “low carbon
    certificate” indicating that the cultivation product has generated more than 10%
    lower carbon emissions than the baseline levels identified in Stage 1. In this
    context, and depending on the carbon reduction target selected, a detailed Carbon
    Reduction Management Plan (CRMP) should be developed including concrete carbon
    reduction actions that should be implemented at the field during the next stage
    (3rd). The identification of emission reduction strategies is essential to set
    up the required Carbon Reduction Management Plan. Some carbon reduction/sequestration
    practices applied at farm level during the implementation of ClimaMED are presented
    in Table 1 based on the associated CRMPs defined at this stage [7,[32], [33],
    [34]]. Table 1. Typical carbon reduction practices implemented at farm level and
    associated carbon reduction benefits and risks. Farm practices Anticipated benefits
    (B)/Potential risks (R) Conservation tillage B: Prevents soil erosion and preserves
    soil quality and carbon storage. Higher productivity can be achieved. R: N2O fluxes
    may increase. Efficient crop-residue management (maintenance of soil cover) B:
    Significant carbon benefits due to the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into the
    soil are achieved. R: Trade-offs between SOC benefits and cash crop yield are
    risky. Long-term N2O emissions may be greater than conventional treatment. Reduced
    or precision fertilization B: Mitigates N2O emissions and reduces soil erosion
    and groundwater contamination. R: Lower crop yields and soil organic carbon sequestration
    may be obtained. Nutrient imbalance and additional costs may occur. Efficient
    irrigation water management B: Significantly reduces energy consumption and lowers
    GHG emissions associated with water extraction, transportation, and distribution.
    R: The impact of irrigation on carbon sequestration can be negligible or negative,
    because the carbon costs of pumping water can exceed the increased carbon stock
    benefits. It may lead to increased an increase in fertilization to compensate
    for the reduced nutrient runoff. Fuel-use efficiency B: Energy efficiency in terms
    of regular maintenance on equipment used and proper storage increases productivity
    while limiting GHG emissions at farm level. R: Unpredictable or increased fuel
    and maintenance costs may occur. Efficient task management B: Data planning, recording
    and reporting of farm operations helps farmers to efficiently use resources, reduce
    GHG emissions and waste generation and avoid duplication. R: There is a risk that
    farmers/farm workers may not be adequately trained to use data web platforms and
    other advanced digital tools/equipment. To address this, seminars and training
    programs may be necessary to ensure that the workforce is skilled and up-to-date.
    Crop rotations diversification B: Promotes soil health and increases soil organic
    matter (SOM). Higher SOM content improves soil structure and water retention,
    facilitating carbon storage. R: Farmers may face challenges in achieving consistent
    yields. It may require additional resources (increased cost) 2.2.1.3. Stage 3:
    implementation of carbon/GHG reduction practices - real time measurements In this
    stage, the proposed actions of the Carbon Reduction Management Plan are implemented
    at the field. On-site measurements of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions (LiDAR) from
    cultivation fields at real time are carried out to enable the provision of accurate
    data (Fig. 3a). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    based on field GHG, meteorological and other measurements: a) Conceptual presentation,
    b) Autonomous equipment installed at farm site (Aegina island, South of Piraeus
    harbor, Greece) and c) IoT telemetry platform for field data management [35].
    The integrated network system developed within the ClimaMED project and implemented
    at farm level integrates several innovative technologies (Fig. 3b), consists of
    [15]. i) A ground-based, Integrated Path, Differential Absorption (IPDA) monitoring
    system designed and validated for detecting CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions (LiDAR
    system) [36]. ii) A meteorological/monitoring station for collecting data on several
    parameters including rainfall, soil and air temperature, soil moisture, air humidity,
    wind speed and direction. iii) An IoT Telemetry Platform which supports on-site
    data management (cloud), data access management, data visualization, alerts and
    reporting through LoRa (Long Range) low-power wide-area network technology (Fig.
    3c) [35] and iv) A Web-based platform called Center of GHGs Monitoring and Management
    (CMM) for collecting, and processing GHG emissions data at farm level (Fig. 4)
    [37]. In parallel, another web-based platform is employed that allows farmers
    to keep records regarding their practices on a frequent basis (per day or week).
    Practices that are recorded and evaluated refer to: tillage (frequency and depth),
    field equipment used (weight, type, power, fuel consumption, hours of use), manure/compost
    purchase/production/distribution (type, frequency, amount, chemical composition),
    irrigation water consumption, use of renewable sources, and other activities or
    equipment that use fuel or electricity. Download : Download high-res image (402KB)

    photovoltaic panels (260Wp) equipped with equal number of batteries (6V) for energy
    autonomy. This off-grid set-up allows a stable and continuous power supply of
    the integrated network system in farms that are not connected to the national
    electricity power grid due to their remote locations or other constraints. 2.2.1.4.
    Stage 4: calculation of carbon footprint – on site monitoring verification By
    using the real time measurements obtained at the field from Stage 3, the Carbon
    footprint (CF) of the Med-based cultivation product, using existing practices,
    in terms of Global Warming Potential (100 year GWP in kg CO2-eq) is calculated.
    In general, the carbon removals derived from existing activities are calculated
    by assessing the difference between the project scenario (specified/individual
    or general reference) and the baseline conditions defined at Stage 1. This difference
    signifies the measurable impact of implemented practices on reducing GHG emissions
    at farm level and the quantity of carbon sequestered into the farm pool [38].
    The cultivation practices with the highest environmental impact are identified
    and good practices are proposed to farmers to minimize emissions, meet the targets
    and obtain the “green” or “low-carbon” certificate. During this stage, the verification/accreditation
    expert body conducts several verification check actions according to the certification
    standards and then provides documentation after the verification is completed.
    The on-site monitoring verification actions may involve: i) Onsite assessment/Farm
    audit, ii) Confirmation of the system boundaries and input/output information-LCI
    (Life cycle inventory), iii) Confirmation of the standardization and completeness
    of the data collection plan for all processes assessed, iv) Checking the implementation
    and the efficiency of the low carbon reduction actions employed in the field and
    v) Checking the accuracy of the field data and secondary/background data and the
    consistency/reliability of the data sources. Data quality in terms of assurance
    and control is of utmost importance for ensuring the accuracy and reliability
    of the field data. In this context, rigorous monitoring (e.g. calibration of equipment
    used at regular intervals, preventive maintenance), transparent reporting protocols
    prevent, detect, and correct (if necessary) any inaccuracies or omissions in the
    reported monitoring parameters and adherence to standardized measurement methodologies
    are integral part of this stage to maintaining the credibility of the certification
    process [39]. 2.2.1.5. Stage 5: certification of “green” or “low-carbon” agricultural
    products In this stage, the accreditation body is responsible for giving approval
    on whether or not the applicant farmer meets all the criteria necessary for certification.
    A public body/official authority depending on the carbon reduction targets reached
    in comparison to baseline conditions (Stage 1), awards a “green certificate” or
    a “low carbon \" certificate to a product/farmer when the overall assessment indicates
    that the obtained results and on-site verification meet the requirements of this
    standard. The award of the certificate is not exclusive. The certificate is valid
    for 4 years and after that, the public body/official authority (at least temporarily
    for the first period of its implementation) and/or an independent certification
    body (such as TÜV NORD, EuroCert, aCert, Eqa, IQS [40] and other accredited certification
    bodies in the Mediterranean region related to agricultural systems) must then
    undergo annual follow-up audits, when a minimum number of the standard''s requirements
    are assessed. 2.2.2. After certification 2.2.2.1. Stage 6: supervision/validity
    of certification In this stage, an independent certification body in collaboration
    with the public body/official authority responsible for the supervision/validity
    of the certification already awarded to the farmer/land owner. Every 2 (two) years,
    a renewal audit conducted by the independent certification body reassesses/validates
    the certified farm unit regarding all the standard''s requirements (all stages
    prior to certification). During this period, all agricultural practices implemented
    at farm level (as in Stage 3) as well as the associated GHG emissions data measurements
    are collected/recorded and reported on a monthly basis in the Center of GHGs Monitoring
    and Management or a similar web-based platform developed by the public or an independent
    certification body. If any slight deviations in relation to carbon reduction targets
    or non-compliance management/documentation issues are identified, prompt corrective
    actions are proposed during the post-certification stage which in turn must be
    undertaken to ensure the continued adherence to certification standards [[41],
    [42], [43]]. This may include adjustments to farming practices, improved or update
    of documentation and record-keeping, additional training for farmers, or modifications
    to on-site infrastructure. In this line, transparency and communication with relevant
    stakeholders, including certification bodies and farmers, are integral components
    of a robust corrective action process, fostering accountability and trust within
    the certified low carbon agricultural system. 2.2.3. Revocation of the certification
    The revocation of a low carbon certificate in agriculture is a significant consequence
    that occurs when a farmer fails to maintain compliance with the required standards
    and criteria [42,44]. This revocation can happen if there is evidence of non-compliance
    with the established guidelines, policies, or regulations related to carbon/GHG
    emissions reduction and sustainable/climate-smart farming practices. Common reasons
    for revocation may include. a) The certified Med-based product does not meet any
    more the requirements of the standard. (fundamental changes in land use, ownership
    or alterations to farming practices occurred) b) The farmer of the certified Med-based
    product does not allow on-site assessment/verification by the public or independent
    third-party body. c) The farmer of the certified Med-based product obtained a
    certification by fraud or other improper means. d) Failure to meet carbon/GHG
    reduction targets and address corrective actions or due to inadequate documentation,
    record-keeping and reporting, and e) Violation of environmental law and policy
    regulations related to natural resources (e.g., soil, groundwater and surface
    water), hazardous and toxic substances, waste management, etc. The revocation
    of certification status can serve as a disciplinary measure and a signal of the
    importance placed on maintaining high standards in sustainable agriculture. It
    highlights the significance of upholding the integrity of low carbon certification
    schemes and ensures that only those farmers who consistently adhere to the prescribed
    guidelines are awarded the certificate. Revocation may motivate farmers to reassess
    their practices, correct some issues, and make the necessary improvements in order
    to regain compliance and restore their eligibility for the low carbon certificate.
    3. key challenges for establishing a “low carbon” product certification system
    The establishment of the proposed “low carbon” product certification system is
    a complex task, that necessitates careful consideration and strategic planning
    across multiple dimensions. Pilot programs allow for the testing and refinement
    of the certification system before full-scale implementation, ensuring that necessary
    adjustments are made based on practical insights and feedback gathered. In this
    context, several key challenges have been identified, and valuable lessons have
    been learned during the development and implementation of the proposed integrated
    framework within the ClimaMED LIFE project [15], including. i) The implementation
    of an on-site monitoring assessment along with a carbon footprint study are essential
    in order to detect emission hot-spots, variability and dynamics and identify suitable
    (economic and technical) approaches to enable their reduction. In this context,
    the selection of the functional unit should be specified for calculating the CF.
    Likewise, the system boundaries need to be specified in order to identify emission
    hot-spots at farm level [24,25]. ii) In order to ensure the efficacy and fairness
    of the proposed low-carbon certification system, it is necessary to identify ‘fair’
    baselines on which to reward additional reductions. In this sense, reliable and
    feasible carbon reduction targets consistent with local conditions and the type
    of Med-based product certified should be set out to allow farmers meet these requirements
    for certification. Carbon reduction targets should be also mindful of socioeconomic
    considerations within farming communities [45]. Assessing the social and economic
    impact of targets on farmers'' livelihoods is crucial to avoid unintended consequences.
    The certification system should be designed to uplift and support farmers economically
    while promoting sustainable practices. iii) The costs of obtaining a low carbon
    certification in agriculture can be high and therefore the conscientious cooperation
    of several authorities, including public bodies, companies and organizations is
    required. These costs should be evaluated in the context of the long-term benefits
    and opportunities associated with sustainable farming and the recognition of environmental
    stewardship. For many small producers, it will be difficult to register for the
    certification system and to afford the associated certification fees [46]. In
    this case, small farms may apply via an agricultural organization or association
    to obtain a group certificate. Group certification may be a vital option that
    reduces the cost of participation but also may involve challenges related to compliance
    and enforcement, especially when groups consist of a large number of spatially
    dispersed farms. iv) Certification also requires renewal every 4 years, a process
    which imposes significant recurring costs associated with data collection, training
    and capacity building, administration/documentation and strategic planning [47].
    However, governments/official authorities may provide direct subsidies or grants
    as well as introduce tax incentives for farmers adopting low carbon practices
    in order to cover the costs associated with obtaining certification and/or its
    renewal. In addition, certified farms may choose to invest in marketing and promotional
    activities to leverage the certification for market access and consumer recognition.
    v) The lack of a well-established certification system is due to the lack of suitable
    data. Most available/open (agricultural) secondary LCI data sets are outdated
    or refer to data at national level and, thus are not reliable at farm or regional
    level [48]. Τhe data set of carbon-based emissions that is used in the proposed
    integrated low carbon certification system is unique since it involves real time
    on-site measurements at farm level. In this context, issues regarding measurement
    equipment ownership, identification of proper location at the farm, standardization/calibration,
    use and maintenance should be dealt with during the establishment of the certification
    system. vi) While certification schemes can be expensive to establish and administer,
    the decision on whether to proceed with them should be based on sound analysis
    of the costs versus the benefits in terms of reduced CO2 emissions, increased
    farmer''s income, better health, etc. Certification systems should be designed
    so that the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the maintenance and operation
    costs [26]. Effective tackling of the aforementioned challenges may require a
    collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, drawing on expertise from environmental
    science, policy development, and stakeholder engagement to ensure the efficacy
    and legitimacy of the certification system in the pursuit of a low-carbon future
    for agricultural production. 4. Conclusions The present study presents the development
    of an integrated framework for low carbon certification based on the implementation
    of associated practices on 15 pilot farms in the Mediterranean region. The six-stage
    low carbon certification framework, anchored in field greenhouse gas measurements
    within an IoT telemetry network, emerges as a robust tool designed to enhance
    the transparency, accountability, and credibility of certification within the
    agricultural sector. By integrating innovative technologies such as LiDAR and
    IoT telemetry with the established LCA methodology, the certification system aims
    to provide a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the carbon footprint associated
    with agricultural activities. This granular approach not only ensures the precision
    of carbon quantification but also empowers farmers with actionable insights to
    optimize their farming operations. Throughout this endeavor, several challenges
    were identified, offering valuable insights that have been instrumental in shaping
    the framework''s resilience and adaptability. Thus, it is crucial to acknowledge
    that the implementation of such an advanced framework may entail various costs
    related to technology adoption, data infrastructure, and farmer training. These
    costs, though an essential investment in the sustainability of agriculture, should
    be carefully considered and balanced with the long-term benefits of reduced emissions,
    increased efficiency, and improved environmental stewardship. By adopting low
    carbon certifications, farmers can position themselves as leaders in the transition
    to a more sustainable and resilient agricultural sector, contributing to climate
    change mitigation, environmental preservation, and the long-term viability of
    the agro-industry. CRediT authorship contribution statement G. Bartzas: Writing

  description: Efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable food production and
    regional water security. Temperature measurements provide information about crop
    water status, which allows the estimation of water needs and precise irrigation
    scheduling. This paper proposes a technology for agricultural irrigation management
    that combines cost-effective implementation with the ability to map crop canopy
    temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on a center pivot.
    The technology integrates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability options,
    IoT capabilities, and web data availability, enabling precise plant water stress
    quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content. It facilitates
    real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion, with canopy
    temperature sensors providing accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C without additional
    calibration. Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models were trained to predict irrigation
    prescriptions, achieving Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE < 4.18 mm) and correlation
    coefficient (r^2 > 0.82). This technology will allow the definition of real-time
    and site-specific prescriptions for variable-rate irrigation systems using infrared
    temperature sensors. Future work includes exploring LoRaWAN technologies, implementing
    a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), improving spatial resolution
    with data fusion algorithms, refining irrigation prescription models, reducing
    sensor costs and developing models considering soil and crop effects.

    2015 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT) are widely adopted for various real-world applications, including medical,
    military, and environment monitoring. These systems have resource-limited sensors
    that collect environmental data, such as temperature and humidity. However, due
    to harsh deployment environments and the inherent limitations of sensors, WSNs
    and IoT systems are vulnerable to various forms of abnormal behaviour. Such anomalies
    can severely impact the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, ultimately
    affecting the applications dependent on them. In WSNs, an outlier refers to a
    data point that deviates significantly from the expected pattern of collected
    data [1]. These outliers can originate from various sources, including errors
    and noise, events, and malicious attacks, as described in [2]. Outlier detection
    approaches can be categorized based on different criteria, such as whether they
    target outliers or events, whether they operate online or offline, and whether
    they are supervised or unsupervised, distributed or centralized [2]. In our research,
    we focus specifically on online outlier detection. Therefore, to mitigate such
    issues, outlier detection techniques have been developed for IoT and WSN applications
    to monitor abnormal behavior and identify and classify outliers in real-time.
    This is essential in applications where timely decision-making is crucial, such
    as the following use cases: Healthcare monitoring: In healthcare applications,
    WSNs are used to monitor patients’ vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure,
    and temperature. Detecting outliers in real-time can help identify critical events
    or errors in the collected data, enabling healthcare professionals to take immediate
    action. Industrial monitoring: WSNs are deployed in industrial settings to monitor
    various parameters like temperature, pressure, and vibration. Outlier detection
    can help identify anomalies that may indicate equipment malfunction or potential
    risks, allowing for proactive maintenance and preventing costly downtime. Smart
    cities: WSNs play a crucial role in smart city applications, monitoring environmental
    factors, traffic conditions, and energy consumption. Real-time outlier detection
    can help identify abnormal patterns or events, such as pollution spikes or traffic
    congestion, enabling efficient management and resource allocation. Our work is
    primarily motivated by considering the real-time Decision-making in such applications.
    Offline detection techniques are insufficient as they cannot process streaming
    data in real-time. Therefore, there is a need for an approach that can detect
    and classify outliers online, ensuring data quality and enabling timely decision-making.
    Secondly, while various solutions have been proposed for online outlier detection,
    they cannot often consider the correlations between sensor data vectors and provide
    a real-time classification of errors and events. Including correlation information
    can help identify the origin of outliers, distinguishing between erroneous data
    that can be discarded and actual events in the physical world that require decision-making.
    The proposed SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach aims to address this limitation by considering
    the spatial-temporal relationships among sensor data vectors. Thirdly, WSNs collect
    data from multiple sensors, resulting in multivariate data. Many existing approaches
    struggle to handle such data effectively. The SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach addresses
    the specific requirements of the previous use cases by providing online outlier
    detection and classification capabilities, considering correlations between different
    multivariate data attributes, and enabling dynamic adaptation to seasonal variations
    in the data. Some existing works address these challenges but still operate offline
    or need more enhancements. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced approach of
    our previous work O\\(^2\\)DCA [3], for online clustering, outlier detection,
    and classification in WSNs. Our new approach, named SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, consists
    of two main systems: the CDC (Clustering, Detection, Classification) system, which
    comprises two key phases—training and online—and the monitoring system. For the
    training phase of the CDC system, we build an initial \\(TM_{0}\\) or a set of
    seasonal training models STM = \\(\\{TM1, TM2,... TMs\\}\\) in an offline manner.
    The goal of \\(TM_{0}\\) is to cluster an initial set of data vectors and detect
    and classify the outliers using different input parameters (cluster radius w and
    the number of nearest neighbours K) to reach the highest Detection Rate (DR) and
    the False Alarm Rate (FAR) performance metrics. This \\(TM_{0}\\) will be used
    later in the online phase to cluster the new coming streaming real-life data vectors.
    Our approach can also able to use a set of seasonal training models and change
    between them dynamically at the end of each season period. Within the CDC system,
    we consider the correlation of sensor data in both time and space. We aim to identify
    the origin of the outliers, distinguishing between erroneous data that can be
    discarded and actual events in the physical world that require a decision. The
    CDC system will alert the monitoring system for every detected error or event.
    The monitoring system will check the received alerts, process them and send different
    feedback information. To evaluate SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, we conduct a simulation test,
    where our approach uses the current \\(TM_{0}\\) until the DR performance changes
    and is less than a predefined threshold \\(\\alpha\\). In such case, we build
    a new TM and continue working online. We also conduct another simulation test,
    where our approach uses the first TM in the set STM and can change the TM dynamically
    at the end of each season. Our approach can also change the current TM and build
    a new one if the level of DR is less than a predefined threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\)
    or the FAR is greater than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Our evaluation focused on the DR
    and FAR performance metrics, specifically in the context of multivariate data.
    Our simulation results, using a combination of synthetic and real-life multivariate
    datasets, show that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms not only our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA
    approach but also other approaches from the literature. Additionally, our enhanced
    approach maintains stable performance across a range of \\(\\alpha\\) values even
    with fewer required \\(TM_{s}\\). The main contribution of this paper can be synthesized
    as: we introduce SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, a novel and advanced approach for online outlier
    detection and classification in WSNs. Our approach utilizes an initial TM that
    is dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of newly arriving streaming
    data vectors. We also developed our new approach to work with seasonal real-life
    applications where it can change the TM dynamically at the end of each season
    period. Our evaluation involves a comparative analysis of the performance of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    against O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] and two other approaches [4] proposed in the literature.
    We assess the performance of these approaches using several performance metrics,
    including DR, FAR, and ACC. Our methodology considers the spatial-temporal relationships
    among sensors multivariate data vectors to distinguish between erroneous and event-based
    outliers. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA,
    is the first to incorporate adaptive TM changing and dynamic adaptation to seasonal
    data in online outlier detection and classification solutions for WSNs. The subsequent
    sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the related
    works concerning online outlier detection in WSNs. Algorithms used in our proposed
    approach and its architecture are presented in Sect. 3. We provide the results
    of our evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets in Sect. 4, where we examine
    various performance metrics. Finally, we conclude the paper in Sect. 5. 2 Related
    Work Online outlier detection refers to identifying and flagging outliers in real-time
    or near real-time as data streams are generated. Such a process is essential for
    several WSN applications, where it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify
    and classify anomalous behaviours to respond to them effectively. On the other
    hand, offline outlier detection is the process of identifying outliers in a dataset
    after it has been collected. This type of outlier detection is commonly employed
    when dealing with massive amounts of data, as it allows for more thorough analysis
    and can provide more accurate results. However, it is unsuitable for applications
    requiring immediate outlier detection and classification. The literature offers
    several approaches for online outlier detection in WSNs. This section discusses
    relevant works in this domain, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In
    [5], a novel approach for outlier identification in WSNs was introduced. The proposed
    method leverages the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
    (DBSCAN) algorithm and consists of two main modules. The first module focuses
    on parameter computation, specifically determining the minimum radius threshold
    (\\(\\epsilon\\)) for accepting a cluster. The second module handles class identification
    within a spatial-temporal dataset, enabling the detection of outliers. In [6],
    an approach for identifying outliers and events in wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    was proposed. This approach utilized the OPTICS clustering algorithm that eliminates
    the need for manual configuration or a predefined number of clusters. The experimental
    results demonstrated that their approach achieved high outlier detection and event
    identification accuracy while maintaining a low rate of false classification between
    errors and events. In [7], the authors developed a new classification model that
    combines deep belief networks with the Online Quarter-Sphere One-Class Support
    Vector Machines (QSOC-SVMs). This model is designed to improve the accuracy and
    efficiency of outlier detection in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets,
    such as those typically gathered by WSNs. Their model uses a sorting method to
    learn the quarter sphere radius during the training phase and then uses this information
    to classify data values as outliers or non-outliers during the unsupervised testing
    phase. In [8], the authors introduced an unsupervised algorithm for real-time
    anomaly detection in continuous data sequences. They utilized the Hierarchical
    Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm, which is an online sequence memory algorithm
    that can continuously learn and model the spatial-temporal characteristics of
    its inputs. However, HTM does not directly model anomalies or provide an anomaly
    score. To address this issue, the authors computed a measure of prediction error
    based on the HTM network output and used a probabilistic model to calculate the
    likelihood of the system being in an anomalous state. A threshold was then applied
    to this likelihood value to determine whether an anomaly was present. In [9],
    authors proposed an online density-based approach for outlier detection on big
    data. Their approach is based on computing the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and
    it has two main steps. First, the Grid-Based Partitioning (GBP) algorithm divides
    the data into grids and assigns them to the distributed nodes in the network.
    This allows outlier detection to be performed in parallel, which is essential
    for dealing with large and high-dimensional datasets. Second, the Distributed
    LOF Computing (DLC) algorithm is used to detect density outliers in each grid
    partitions. This algorithm is designed to be efficient and scalable, and it can
    effectively handle high-dimensional data without requiring a large amount of network
    resources. In [10], authors proposed a new timely fog computing outlier detection
    method for IoT systems. Their method is designed to overcome the high latency
    of centralised approaches and the high energy consumption of distributed ones.
    Their proposed method sends all data values directly to the fog nodes for outlier
    detection. This eliminates the need for multi-hop transmission and allows efficient
    and low-latency outlier detection. The authors proposed two algorithms for outlier
    detection: the Ellipsoidal Neighbourhood Outlier Factor (ENOF), which is based
    on the LOF algorithm, and the Hyper-ellipsoidal clustering algorithm (HyCARCE).
    The ENOF algorithm is designed for high efficiency and low computation cost, while
    the HyCARCE algorithm solves the problem of prior knowledge of cluster parameters
    by automatically choosing them. Together, these algorithms provide a flexible
    and effective approach for outlier detection in IoT systems. In [11], the authors
    proposed a one-time framework for detecting outliers with a request. Their framework
    consists of two primary phases: the offline phase and the online phase. In the
    offline phase, they employ the K-Medoids algorithm to cluster the data points
    within the dataset. They also use a density-based outlier factor to identify the
    normal and outlier clusters. In the online phase, they use the clustering information
    and the detected outliers to detect the newly arrived outliers on the fly based
    on specific requests. This allows the framework to quickly and accurately detect
    outliers in the dataset. In [12], the authors proposed an Optimised Adaptive and
    Sliding Windowing (OASW) framework for anomaly detection in IoT data streams.
    Their framework is designed to adapt to the changing patterns of online IoT data
    streams, using the fast and high-performance LightGBM machine learning model and
    the drift adaptation concept. The OASW framework is a combination of sliding and
    adaptive window-based methods and performance-based methods. It is designed to
    efficiently and effectively detect anomalies in IoT data streams, and it consists
    of two stages: the first stage involves offline learning to obtain an initial
    trained model, while the second stage focuses on online training to identify IoT
    attacks in real-time data streams. In [13], the authors proposed a fully distributed
    General Anomaly Detection (GAD) scheme for real-time anomaly detection. This scheme
    uses the principles of graph theory and takes advantage of the spatial-temporal
    correlations of processes to achieve fast and accurate anomaly detection. However,
    the GAD scheme cannot detect anomalous events that consist of a series of related
    unusual behaviours that reflect changes in those behaviours. This type of anomaly,
    which may be particularly interesting in some applications, cannot be detected
    by the GAD scheme. In [14], the authors proposed a Performance Weighted Probability
    Averaging Ensemble (PWPAE) framework for detecting anomalies in data streams generated
    by IoT devices. Their framework is designed to be drift adaptive, meaning that
    it can adapt to changes in the data distribution over time, which is a common
    challenge in the field of data stream mining. It combines two drift detection
    methods, ADaptive WINdowing (ADWIN) and Drift Detection Method (DDM), with two
    drift adaptation methods token from literature to construct base classifiers,
    which are then combined into a single ensemble model using a weighting scheme
    based on their real-time performance. They prove that their framework achieves
    high accuracy in detecting IoT attacks. In [15], the authors have employed a modified
    Hampel Identifier (HI) algorithm for real-time detection of temporal outliers
    and have merged it with a Gaussian process (GP) model and a graph-based outlier
    detection technique to enhance the algorithm’s ability to detect spatial outliers.
    The GP model enables the algorithm to consider the spatial relationships among
    data points, while the graph-based outlier detection technique identifies outliers
    that may not be apparent when considering individual data points independently.
    The proposed approach effectively detects temporal and spatial outliers in real-time,
    with a high accuracy identification rate and low resource requirements. In [16],
    the authors have suggested implementing real-time anomaly detection in telemetry
    data using streaming machine learning techniques. They have utilized the DenStream
    method, an unsupervised clustering technique, to process data as it is being generated
    in real-time instead of relying on offline processing of vast amounts of data.
    They have also conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of DenStream
    with other online and offline algorithms such as DBScan, Local Outlier Factor
    (LOF), ExactSTORM, Continuous Outlier Detection (COD), and Robust Random Cut Forest
    (RRCF). The experimental results have shown that DenStream performs as well as
    RRCF, which is the best-performing algorithm, in terms of detection outcomes,
    and is significantly faster than the other approaches, particularly RRCF. In [3],
    the authors proposed a centralized approach, named O\\(^2\\)DCA, for online outlier
    detection and classification in WSN. O\\(^2\\)DCA considers the spatial-temporal
    relationships between sensor data vectors and their neighbouring sensor nodes
    to distinguish between errors caused by sensor malfunctions and errors caused
    by events. The approach combines the distributed Fixed Width Clustering (FWC)
    and Inter Cluster Distance (ICD) algorithms for clustering and outlier detection,
    respectively. Additionally, the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method is used
    for classification. Simulation results showed that the proposed approach outperforms
    the offline approach and is suitable for real-life applications where the DR performance
    metric remains stable and better. In [17], the authors introduce a novel approach
    to enhance the security of wireless sensor WSNs by proposing a new Intrusion Detection
    System (IDS) based on a deep learning model. Emphasizing optimal cluster head
    (CH) selection among sensor nodes, the method considers energy levels, delay,
    and distance. The innovative Self-Improved Sea Lion Optimization (SI-SLnO) model
    is introduced for optimal CH selection. The paper advocates a multidimensional
    two-tier hierarchical trust model, evaluating content trust, honesty trust, and
    interactive trust for both CH and nodes. Intrusion detection is performed using
    a deep learning-based approach with an optimized neural network trained by the
    SI-SLnO algorithm. The paper concludes by evaluating the proposed approach against
    existing techniques, showcasing its potential for improving WSN security. In [18],
    the authors address in their survey the challenges posed by mobile nodes in the
    context of the IoT. With IoT nodes generating substantial data that requires seamless
    indexing for storage and processing, the mobility of nodes introduces complexities.
    Existing indexing techniques for mobile environments are deemed inadequate due
    to data transmission from diverse locations over varying time periods and the
    randomness of sensor movement. The survey aims to elucidate the relationship between
    activities of mobile sensors in IoT, focusing on data transfer, collection, and
    the effectiveness of indexing techniques. By exploring meta-heuristic, spatial-temporal
    indexing, and prediction model approaches, the review investigates the challenges
    affecting indexing effectiveness in mobile IoT nodes. The analysis delves into
    features, limitations, and requirements, providing insights into the behavior
    of mobile environments. The survey concludes by highlighting overlooked or unknown
    open issues in the domain. In [19], the authors propose a distributed algorithm
    for detecting dynamic environmental phenomena using mobile WSNs. The algorithm
    assumes there is no centralized server to collect and aggregate sensor data. Instead,
    the sensors self-organize into groups, with a few sensors elected as group heads
    (GHs). Each group of sensors detects phenomena locally, and the GHs communicate
    the detected information among themselves to detect global phenomena. The paper
    also introduces two GH election algorithms and an optimization technique to reduce
    energy costs. The proposed algorithms and methods are validated through experiments
    using the NS2 network simulator. The paper contributes a distributed algorithm,
    GH election algorithms, and an optimization technique to reduce energy costs in
    detecting environmental phenomena in mobile WSNs. In summary, we can say that
    several online outlier detection approaches are used in literature in WSNs and
    IoT. However, most of these works suffer from one or many of the following limitations:
    According to [5,6,7, 9, 10], and [11], the first limitation of their works is
    the lack of emphasis on exploring the correlation between sensors’ data vectors
    for outlier and event identification in the environment. Except for the O\\(^2\\)DCA
    work [3], which we reference for comparison. Although [8, 12, 13] have examined
    the correlation, they did not use its properties to differentiate between errors
    and events. The two baseline approaches proposed in the literature [5] and [6]
    are also referenced for comparison with our new approach. The selected approaches
    have been recognized as commonly used techniques in the literature, where they
    are online and manipulate the three different phases. Additionally, they have
    only detected one sensor outlier and only some events were detected without exploring
    correlations. The dataset used in that study was univariate and did not accurately
    represent the features of real-life WSNs applications. Another limitation highlighted
    in previous research, such as [9] and [10], is that their works can only provide
    an outlier score and may not detect all outliers promptly or distinguish between
    errors and events. Furthermore, the approach proposed in [11] only detects outliers
    upon request. A third limitation observed in previous studies, such as [11] and
    [12], is the lack of sufficient feedback information to facilitate adaptive changes
    in the TM of the online system. Except for the O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3], which we
    reference for comparison. In the case of [13], the authors have examined the spatial-temporal
    correlations and differentiated between novelties and anomalies using a univariate
    dataset without providing feedback information to the online system. One potential
    drawback in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3] is the inability to dynamically
    adapt the TM to the streaming data and the use of the FWC clustering algorithm
    which forms fixed-size clusters using a fixed-width parameter w. However, the
    algorithm’s performance is sensitive to the selection of this parameter. If the
    chosen value of w is too small, the algorithm may generate an excessive number
    of small clusters, while if it is too large, it may produce too few large clusters.
    Thus, selecting an appropriate value of w is crucial for the FWC algorithm to
    operate effectively. However, determining the appropriate value of w can be challenging
    in practical scenarios, particularly for datasets with high dimensionality or
    clusters with varying densities or shapes. The K-means used in our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    approach is a centralised algorithm, different from the distributed FWC used in
    our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work. The shortcomings of previous studies have motivated
    us to develop a new online approach that utilizes a multivariate dataset for clustering,
    outlier detection, and classification of errors and events over time. This approach
    exploits the correlation properties of sensor data vectors and employs adaptive
    processing through various TM. We have used both real-life and seasonal real-life
    WSN streaming data to evaluate our approach. 3 SA-O2DCA Architecture The SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    consists of two main systems like O\\(^2\\)DCA: the CDC (Clustering, Detection,
    Classification) system with two main phases (training and online) and the monitoring
    system. Figure 1 gives a detailed flow chart of our CDC and monitoring systems.
    In what follows, we describe the two phases of the CDC and monitoring systems.
    Fig. 1 A detailed flow chart of our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach Full size image 3.1
    The CDC System The first phase of the CDC system involves building a set of offline
    seasonal training models STM. These models aim to cluster an initial set of seasonal
    data vectors and detect and classify the outliers using different input parameters,
    like the number of nearest neighbours K and the optimal clusters number N, that
    give the highest DR and the lowest FAR performance metrics. For that, we use the
    K-means clustering algorithm to group data vectors of each sensor in a centralised
    manner into clusters, where each data vector will be in a cluster with a radius
    w. After that, the base station executes the Iforest outlier detection method
    to identify the existing outliers. Finally, the classification of detected outliers
    into errors and relevant events is performed using the Newton interpolation and
    KNN methods. As a result, we have a set of training model STM where each TM in
    this set corresponds to a set of clusters C, so for the STM: STM = \\(\\{TM1,
    TM2,... TMs\\}\\) set we have another set TC: TC = \\(\\{C1, C2,... Cs\\}\\),
    a determined value of K and the optimal clusters’ number N which is calculated
    automatically for each TM in STM, that we can use in the online phase. The second
    phase of the CDC system is the online phase, where we use the first TM in the
    set STM to cluster the new streaming data vectors. The DR and the FAR performance
    metrics used to evaluate our approach are defined in (5 and 6) respectively. In
    this phase, the base station executes our new online outlier detection and classification
    Algorithm 1 using the first TM in the set STM. We start to work in an online manner,
    where we calculate the Euclidean distance (1) between the current newly arrived
    real-life streaming data vector and each cluster existing in the first C in the
    set TC. After that, we add this data vector to the nearest cluster based on the
    calculated Euclidean distance. We consider this data vector an outlier if we cannot
    add it to any existing cluster. $$\\begin{aligned} d(x,y)= \\sqrt{(y_{1}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-x_{2})^2}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) Our online system continues to receive the coming streaming
    data vectors and detects the existing outliers. We also differentiate between
    events and errors. During the online phase, we can send two different alerts to
    the monitoring system: Alert for an outlier data vector founded and classified
    as an error. Alert for an outlier data vector founded and classified as an event.
    Our approach uses the K-means clustering algorithm [20], a centralized and non-parametric
    approach to partition data into clusters based on their similarity. This algorithm
    is widely used in data analysis and has applications in various fields, such as
    outlier detection, image processing, bioinformatics, and social network analysis.
    Moreover, we employ the Iforest method [21] to identify the outliers, which is
    a technique for anomaly detection based on binary trees. Additionally, for classification,
    we use the Newton interpolation method [22] combined with the K Nearest Neighbours
    (KNN) method to study the correlation between sensors data vectors and classify
    detected outliers into errors and events using multivariate real-life and synthetic
    datasets. These algorithms have not been used in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    [3], and we showed their effectiveness in this study. Our novel approach aims
    to address the limitations of existing methods in literature by considering correlations
    between sensor data vectors, providing real-time classification of errors and
    events, handling multivariate data, and dynamically adapting the Training Model
    (TM) based on the characteristics of the streaming online data. The choice of
    K-means, Iforest and Newton algorithms was motivated by their performance in dealing
    with multivariate online streaming data. The paper highlights the originality
    and unique contributions of the proposed solution in combining these algorithms
    to achieve effective online outlier detection and classification approach in WSNs.
    3.1.1 K-Means Clustering Algorithm K-means clustering is a technique to partition
    a set of n data vectors into k clusters. Each cluster is represented by its centroid,
    which is the mean of all the data vectors in that cluster. Each data vector has
    m attributes. The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squared distances
    between each data vector and its closest centroid. Let X = {\\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),...,
    \\(x_{n}\\)} be a set of n data vectors, where each data vector \\(x_{i}\\) has
    m attributes. The K-means algorithm can be described mathematically as follows:
    1. Initialize k cluster centroids randomly from X: C = {\\(c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\),...,
    \\(c_{k}\\)} \\(\\subset\\) X. 2. Assign each data vector \\(x_{i}\\) to the closest
    centroid \\(c_{j}\\), where: j = argmin\\(||\\) \\(x_{i}\\)-\\(c_{j}\\) \\(||\\)
    \\(^2\\). ArgMin is a mathematical function that returns the argument (i.e., the
    input value) that minimizes a given function. 3. Recalculate the centroid of each
    cluster as the mean of all the data vectors assigned to it: $$\\begin{aligned}
    c_{j} = (1/|S_{j}|) * \\sum x_{i} \\in S_{j} \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where \\(S_{j}\\)
    is the set of data vectors assigned to cluster j. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until
    the centroids no longer change or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
    3.1.2 Iforest Outlier Detection Method Iforest is a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm
    used for anomaly detection. It operates by randomly partitioning the data space
    and isolating anomalies that are more easily separable than normal data vectors.
    The Iforest algorithm works by constructing a collection of isolation trees, each
    of which is a binary tree that recursively partitions the data into two subsets
    based on randomly selected features and split vectors. Anomalies are expected
    to be isolated in small, highly partitioned data space regions, leading to shorter
    average path lengths from the root to the leaf nodes of the isolation trees. The
    anomaly score of a data vector is calculated as the inverse of the average path
    length, which measures the degree of isolation of the vector. The Iforest algorithm
    has several advantages over other anomaly detection methods, including its ability
    to handle high-dimensional data, its efficiency in detecting anomalies, and its
    robustness to outliers and noise. The Iforest algorithm has been applied to various
    applications, such as network intrusion detection, fraud detection, and anomaly
    detection in time-series data. The algorithm can be described mathematically as
    follows: Given a dataset X = {\\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),..., \\(x_{n}\\)} with
    n data vectors where each \\(x_{i}\\) is a vector of m attributes, the Isolation
    Forest algorithm constructs a collection of T binary trees, each of which is built
    recursively by randomly selecting a feature j from the d features and a split
    vector p between the minimum and maximum vector of feature j in a sub sample of
    n data vectors. The data vectors are partitioned into two subsets based on whether
    their feature j is less than or greater than p, and the process is repeated until
    each leaf node contains only one data vector or the depth of the tree exceeds
    a predefined isolation depth c. The anomaly score \\(s_{i}\\) of a data vector
    \\(x_{i}\\) is calculated as the inverse of the average path length from the root
    to the leaf nodes of the T trees that \\(x_{i}\\) traverses, normalized by a factor
    of c: $$\\begin{aligned} s_{i} = 2^{\\frac{-E(h_{i})}{c}} \\end{aligned}$$ (3)
    where: E(\\(h_{i}\\)) is the average path length from the root to the leaf nodes
    of the T trees that \\(x_{i}\\) traverses, and cis the isolation depth parameter.
    Anomalies are expected to have shorter average path lengths and higher anomaly
    scores than normal data vectors. The threshold vector for anomaly detection can
    be set based on the desired DR or FAR. 3.1.3 Newton Outlier Classification Method
    Newton’s interpolation method is a polynomial technique used to approximate a
    function using a set of data vectors. The polynomial is constructed by using divided
    differences of the function vectors at the data vectors. In our previous work
    [22], we use the Newton interpolation method to examine the correlation between
    neighbouring data vectors in both space and time. This helps us classify detected
    outliers as either errors or events. The Newton forward difference method is used
    to estimate the value of a data vector (y)=DV of a node \\(node_i\\) at a specific
    location (x) using a set of neighbouring independent indexes (\\(x_{i}\\)) and
    a set of \\(K+1\\) dependent data Vectors (\\(y_{i}\\) = \\(DV_i\\)). We start
    the process by calculating the KNN to find the K nearest neighbours for all nodes.
    The differences between these dependent data vectors (\\(y_{1}\\) – \\(y_{0}\\),
    \\(y_{2}\\) – \\(y_{1}\\),...,\\(y_{K}\\) – \\(y_{K-1}\\)) are referred to as
    the first forward differences: (\\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_0\\), \\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_1\\),...,\\(\\Delta\\)
    \\(y_{K-1}\\)). Then, we calculate the interpolated data vector \\(N_i\\): $$\\begin{aligned}
    N_i = y_0 + u \\Delta y_0 + \\frac{u(u-1)}{2!} \\Delta ^{2} y_0+...+ \\frac{u(u-1)(u-2)(u-K+1)}{K!}\\Delta
    ^{K} y_0 \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where: u = \\(x_i\\) - \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_i\\),
    \\(x_0\\) are the indexes of the \\(node_i\\) and its first neighbour. The neighbours’
    indexes of \\(node_i\\) is the list [\\(x_0, x_1,..., x_{K-1}\\)]. The neighbours’
    data vectors of \\(node_i\\) is the list [\\(DV_0, DV_1,..., DV_{K-1}\\)]. After
    that, we calculate the difference between the interpolated data vector calculated
    in Eq. 4\\(N_i\\) and the actual data vector \\(DV_i\\). If the difference is
    greater than \\(\\epsilon\\), we have an error data vector. Elsewhere we have
    an event data vector. 3.2 The Monitoring System The monitoring system will check
    the received alerts from the online system and compare them with the corresponding
    control data. These control data are stored in the monitoring system and contain
    information about the validity of the received alerts if they are true or false.
    The control data lets the adaptive processing unit generate three different feedback
    information that will be sent back to the CDC system: TPA: True Positive Alert
    for an outlier data vector received and classified rightly as an error or event.
    TNA: True Negative Alert for an outlier data vector received but classified badly
    as an error or event. FPA: False Positive Alert for an outlier data vector received
    but it is a normal data vector. The monitoring system can send this feedback information
    to the online system. The CDC system stays working online while receiving feedback
    information for a TPA. However, the online system will check the DR and FAR performance
    metrics and verify if it is less than a specific threshold \\(\\alpha\\) when
    the specified time intervals pass or if it receives TNA or FPA feedback information.
    If the DR is less than \\(\\alpha _1\\) or the FAR higher than \\(\\alpha _2\\),
    it builds a new (TM) using the recently stored data vectors (e.g. last 1000 records),
    where they are more suitable for the current situation and so on. Otherwise, the
    CDC system stays working in an online manner. If the DR stays higher than \\(\\alpha
    _{1}\\) or the FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), the CDC system stays working
    in an online manner until reaching the end of the first season then it changes
    dynamically to next TM in the set STM. This process is described in the Algorithm
    1. The code of our approach is available at [23]. Algorithm 1 SA-O2DCA algorithm
    Full size image 4 Evaluation and Simulation Results This section presents the
    results of our MATLAB simulations, which are designed to evaluate our approach’s
    performance with multivariate datasets. We provide a detailed description of the
    evaluation scenario and analyze the obtained results. Our simulation assumes a
    hierarchical network structure, where all sensor nodes are accurately synchronized,
    and the observed data vectors conform to the same unknown distribution. Furthermore,
    the nodes are assumed to be deployed in a homogeneous environment. The primary
    objective of detecting outliers in WSNs is to create efficient techniques that
    minimize communication overhead and account for resource limitations of sensor
    nodes, such as memory and battery life. Several performance metrics are employed
    to assess the efficacy of outlier detection and classification techniques, such
    as the DR, which is the percentage of abnormal data values accurately identified
    as outliers as defined in (5), and the FAR, which is the percentage of normal
    data values incorrectly identified as outliers as defined in (6). Another approach
    to evaluate outlier detection methods using the ACC, which is the proportion of
    true detections as defined in (7). We utilize the confusion matrix shown in Table
    1 to establish these performance metrics. We specify four distinct scenarios for
    evaluating the outlier detection phase, which are: True Positive (TP): An outlier
    is inserted, and the algorithm correctly identifies it. False Positive (FP): Nothing
    is inserted, but the algorithm identifies an outlier. True Negative (TN): Nothing
    is inserted, and the algorithm does not identify an outlier. False Negative (FN):
    An outlier is inserted, but the algorithm does not identify it. Table 1 The online
    detection phase confusion matrix Full size table $$\\begin{aligned} DR= & {} TP
    / (TP + FP) \\end{aligned}$$ (5) $$\\begin{aligned} FAR= & {} FP / (FP + TN) \\end{aligned}$$
    (6) $$\\begin{aligned} ACC= & {} (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN) \\end{aligned}$$ (7)
    It should be acknowledged that there are alternative methods of evaluating outlier
    detection techniques, such as assessing complexity and computational cost. However,
    our current study does not take these types of evaluations into account. 4.1 Evaluation
    Methodology We create the set STM, and we combine two datasets. The first dataset,
    known as the Real-life DataSet (RDS), is sourced from the Berkeley dataset. It
    consists of 2.3 million readings from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel Berkeley
    Research lab between February 28th and April 5th, 2004 [24]. Each data vector,
    collected every 30 s, contains attributes such as temperature, humidity, light,
    and voltage. For our experiments, we extract 2000 data vectors with temperature
    and humidity attributes to construct each TM in the set. The second dataset is
    a Synthetic DataSet (SDS) created to achieve high detection rate (DR) and low
    false alarm rate (FAR) performance metrics for the RDS. To generate the SDS, we
    use a uniformly random generator to introduce a set of errors and events. The
    SDS comprises 90 outliers, with 60 errors and 30 events. The process of constructing
    each TM in STM involves four key steps. Firstly, we apply the K-means algorithm
    to cluster the RDS and obtain a set of clusters C. The number of clusters is determined
    automatically in advance. Next, we employ the Iforest method to detect outliers
    in the RDS. In the second step, we use the SDS, which consists of three parts:
    temperature with added outliers, humidity with added outliers, and control data,
    to label the data vectors with values (0 for normal, 1 for events, and 2 for errors).
    We then check if each data vector from SDS belongs to any cluster in C. If it
    does, we consider it as normal and add it to the corresponding cluster. Otherwise,
    we identify it as an outlier and output it accordingly. In the third step, we
    classify each outlier data vector as either an error or an event using Newton
    and KNN methods. Finally, in the fourth step, we calculate the DR and FAR performance
    metrics based on the control data of SDS for different numbers of nearest neighbours,
    denoted as K. As a result, we choose the input parameters (K, C) that give the
    highest DR and the lowest FAR. These training models STM will be used in the online
    phase. In addition, we evaluate our CDC system with different values of \\(\\alpha\\),
    which are accepted to stay in the online phase. If the DR and FAR stay over the
    specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), or the CDC system
    did not receive any (TNA, FPA) from the monitoring system, so the CDC system stay
    online and wait until reaching the end of the first season to change the TM dynamically
    and work with TM2 and so on. Otherwise, we need to build a new TM from the recent
    coming data. 4.2 Discussion Results The performance of the offline approach is
    evaluated by computing the DR and FAR performance metrics. These metrics are calculated
    based on a confusion matrix, which is shown in Table 2. Four different cases are
    defined for evaluating the offline classification phase: TP: This refers to the
    situation where the algorithm correctly predicts an event when it is actually
    present. FP: This refers to the situation where the algorithm predicts the occurrence
    of an event when, in reality, no event is present. TN: This occurs when the algorithm
    correctly recognizes the absence of an event and predicts accordingly. FN: This
    occurs when the algorithm fails to predict an event that is present. Table 2 The
    online classification phase confusion matrix Full size table In the first experiment,
    we evaluated SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA in terms of DR, FAR and ACC under varying Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) conditions, measured in decibels (dB), as defined in [4]. The SNR
    values considered in their study encompassed a range of (-30 dB, -20 dB, -10 dB,
    0 dB, 10 dB, 20 dB, 30 dB). Each SNR level introduced different magnitudes of
    outliers into the data. Our objective was to examine the performance of the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    approach under different levels of outlier presence in the data. To assess the
    performance, we compared our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach with the O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    [3], as well as two other online approaches, namely OPTICS-OD and DBSCAN-OD, introduced
    in [4] during the detection phase. We employed a confusion matrix, as depicted
    in Table 1. The results, as shown in Fig. 2, indicated that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved
    the highest DR across all SNR values, surpassing our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    and the other two approaches. We also observed that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the
    lowest FAR, except in comparison to DBSCAN-OD, where DBSCAN-OD exhibited the lowest
    FAR. Additionally, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the highest ACC, except in comparison
    to DBSCAN-OD, where DBSCAN-OD obtained the highest ACC. It is worth noting that
    the FAR and ACC values we obtained were considered reasonable. Conversely, the
    FAR and ACC values of OPTICS-OD and DBSCAN-OD appeared unreliable, as it is not
    plausible to have low DR, very low FAR, and extremely high ACC. Therefore, we
    can assert that our proposed SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach demonstrated superior performance
    compared to the other solutions examined. Fig. 2 Performance metrics at the outlier
    detection phase for the average of all SNR values Full size image In the second
    experiment, we build \\(TM_{0}\\) using 2000 data vectors with (m = 2) attributes,
    temperature and humidity. We also use an SDS that contains 90 outliers (60 errors
    and 30 events). In this experiment, we evaluate the offline approach and calculate
    the DR and FAR performance metrics. To calculate these metrics, we take the confusion
    matrix as presented in Table 2. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\) and an SDS of 300 outliers
    (200 errors and 100 events) as explained in section 4.1. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\)
    to cluster, detect and classify the complete set of data which contains 10000
    data vectors in an offline manner. We get for the offline approach a DR equal
    to 82% and a FAR equal to 10%. This value allows us to evaluate our online system
    with different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). In the third
    experiment, we evaluated SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA regarding DR and FAR
    performance metrics using the confusion matrix presented in Table 2. We use the
    \\(TM_{0}\\) to cluster the streaming dataset containing 10000 data vectors. We
    detect and classify the outlier in the streaming set in an online manner. Table
    3 shows the obtained results when evaluating the DR and FAR metrics of O\\(^2\\)DCA
    and SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches during the online classification phase. We notice
    that we have nine \\(TM_{s}\\) for our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach and five
    \\(TM_{s}\\) for our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach, each representing an average
    of several time intervals. The online system changes the model if the DR is less
    than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) or FAR is higher than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). These values
    are equal to the values of DR and FAR resulting from evaluating the offline approach.
    We notice that for O\\(^2\\)DCA, we have an average DR higher than \\(\\alpha
    _{1}\\) and an average FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for all \\(TM_{s}\\) except
    for \\(TM_{0}\\), \\(TM_{4}\\) and \\(TM_{5}\\). In these cases, we change them
    directly at the end of the time interval where we have DR less than \\(\\alpha
    _{1}\\) and FAR higher than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Whereas for SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, we
    have an average DR higher than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and an average FAR less than
    \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for all \\(TM_{s}\\). In addition, with SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA we
    reach the stable model quickly with less \\(TM_{s}\\) compared to O\\(^2\\)DCA.

    different \\(TM_{s}\\) − \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) = 82% and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) = 10%
    Full size table In the fourth experiment, we take the DR and the FAR values for
    the offline approach, which is calculated in the second experiment. In Table 4,
    we show that the DR and FAR metrics of our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach during the
    online classification phase, for the average of all \\(TM_{s}\\), is better than
    the DR and FAR of our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach [3] and the offline approach.

    we evaluated the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches in terms of the DR
    and FAR performance metrics using different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) (80%,
    82%, 85%, 95%) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) (12%, 10%, 8%, 6%). We can see from Fig.
    3 that our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach has higher DR than O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] for
    all the different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\). Fig. 3 The DR for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA

    see from Fig. 4 that our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach has lower FAR than O\\(^2\\)DCA

    experiment, we evaluated the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches regarding
    the DR and FAR performance metrics using a seasonal dataset of 8000 data vectors
    that contains four seasons. In this experiment, we build four offline training
    models \\(\\{TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4\\}\\). In this scenario, we check if the DR stays
    over the specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and FAR stay down the specified
    threshold \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), or if the CDC system did not receive any (TNA, FPA)
    from the monitoring system, so the CDC system stays online and wait until reaching
    the end of the first season to change the training model dynamically and work
    with \\(TM_{2}\\) and so on. Otherwise, we need to build a new training model
    from the recent coming data. From Figs. 5, 6, 7, we can see the percentage of
    the DR, FAR and ACC for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA. We notice that the
    two approaches have good performance metrics when dealing with the seasonal data
    with four \\(TM_{s}\\). From Fig. 5, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA
    have higher DR than the specified thresholds \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) for the four seasonal
    \\(TM_{s}\\). We also notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has higher DR than O\\(^2\\)DCA
    for all \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 5 DR of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured

    have lower FAR than the specified thresholds \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for the four seasonal
    \\(TM_{s}\\). We also notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has lower FAR than O\\(^2\\)DCA
    for all \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 6 FAR of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    measured for the seasonal multivariate dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) and \\(\\alpha

    higher ACC than O\\(^2\\)DCA for the four seasonal \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 7 ACC of
    SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured for the seasonal multivariate
    dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) Full size image To summarize the results, our new
    SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms both the offline approach, O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] and two
    other approaches [4] from the literature in the clustering, detection, and classification
    phases when worked in an online fashion. In addition, the DR and FAR performance
    metrics are still stable over specified thresholds, although we use different
    training models. So, we show the efficiency of our new approach and its ability
    to work online with both real-life and seasonal real-life multivariate WSN data.
    5 Conclusion This paper introduces SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, a novel and effective online
    approach designed to address outlier challenges in WSNs while achieving high performance.
    The proposed approach has two central systems, the CDC and the monitoring systems.
    The CDC system consists of two main phases. In the training phase, we build an
    initial TM or a set of initial \\(TM_{s}\\) based on the K-means clustering algorithm,
    Iforest method for outlier detection and Newton interpolation method combined
    with KNN for outlier classification. In the online phase, we perform online clustering,
    outlier detection, and classification for the new real-life arrived streaming
    data vectors using the previous algorithms. The second system is the monitoring
    system that can check the received alerts from the online system and send different
    feedback information. Our system can stay online with higher DR, lower FAR and
    higher classification ACC performance than O\\(^2\\)DCA. It can also change the
    current training model by building a new one like O\\(^2\\)DCA. Additionally,
    SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA is suitable for real-life seasonal applications where it can change
    between a set of \\(TM_{s}\\) dynamically at the end of each season. The simulation
    results obtained from synthetic and real-life multivariate datasets and a seasonal
    multivariate dataset demonstrated that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms O\\(^2\\)DCA
    and other existing approaches in terms of DR, FAR and ACC performance metrics.
    Notably, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieves superior performance while utilizing a smaller
    number of \\(TM_{s}\\) compared to our previous work, O\\(^2\\)DCA. Also, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    can stay stable with fewer \\(TM_{s}\\) number than the number required by our
    previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work. In our future research, we aim to thoroughly assess
    our novel online approach by testing it with various clustering algorithms and
    datasets with high levels of correlation. Additionally, we plan to explore the
    potential of utilizing deep learning algorithms to facilitate dynamic switching
    between different \\(TM_{s}\\), enabling the reuse of pre-existing models rather
    than building new ones. Such a study could enhance our approach’s adaptability
    and efficiency. References Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V.: Anomaly detection:

  description: In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) is closely integrated with
    smart agriculture, providing better technical guarantee for the growth management
    and yield estimation of agricultural products. In this paper, targeted at the
    distributed jujube orchards, we develop a federated learning-based framework for
    secure multi-regional yield estimation on IoT edge devices. In specific, we propose
    the UAVEC-FLchain framework for secure and efficient jujube yield estimation,
    consisting of the UAVEC module, data joint processing module, and data tracking
    module. Different UAV devices are used at edge terminals to collect distributed
    images of different jujube orchards, and the model is trained securely with federation
    learning and blockchain. Furthermore, we propose a method to avoid malicious node
    attacks by calculating the contribution of computing nodes. Experimental results
    indicate that as the number of participating nodes increases, the average detection
    accuracy improves. The results of training with 60 nodes show an 8.06 % improvement
    over training with 6 nodes. When facing malicious node attacks, the relative error
    of the proposed framework is 10.24 % lower than that with traditional federated
    learning.

    Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction Today, with the increase in agricultural production
    to meet the growing needs of the population, concern has been raised about food
    supply for the people [1]. Pollution of water, soil, air, soil erosion, resistance
    of pests to poisons and the spread of chemical fertilizers have caused us to go
    back to the past ways of farming in order to preserve resources. Agriculture,
    which in any case is low yield, is looking after the future health of mankind.
    According to the forecasts, the world population will reach 2.8 billion people
    by 2025, 83% of which belong to developing countries and 17% to developed countries
    [2, 3]. As the population density increases, the effects of competition increase
    in the same proportion. More population means more energy consumption and environmental
    pollution. In addition, the increase in demand for food resources leads to excessive
    use of resources, exhaustion, destruction, destruction of natural resources and
    reduction of biodiversity [4]. In many parts of the world, there is no additional
    land, and in other parts, increasing the area under the cultivation of crops is
    not acceptable from the environmental and social aspects [5]. Therefore, in order
    to increase the production in the existing fields, we need a suitable plant protection
    program against damage before and after harvest. One of the most important problems
    that have been associated with agriculture since its inception are agricultural
    pests. In general, we cannot completely eradicate agricultural pests, but we must
    manage them. Any living or non-living factor that causes economic damage to humans,
    animals or products is classified as a pest [6, 7]. One of the main reasons for
    the expansion of agriculture is the production of products with the highest efficiency
    [8]. The farmer must be able to protect the crop from agricultural pests for high
    yield. By applying simple methods, damage from pests and diseases can be prevented
    or minimized. One of the goals of organic farming is that, in addition to having
    healthy production without complications caused by chemical fertilizers and poisons,
    it can also have a quantitatively justifiable yield [9]. Environmentally friendly
    control technologies include those that use physical control agents such as light,
    heat, and mild radiation to control diseases and insect pests [10, 11]. Ozone
    is a very strong oxidizer that has the potential to kill harmful insects and microorganisms
    [12]. In general, ozone has more advantages than traditional food preservation
    methods and is a suitable alternative to traditional insecticides. Ozone can be
    used to destroy storage pests, microorganisms and mycotoxins [1]. One of the important
    advantages of ozone is the rapid decomposition of its residue into oxygen, so
    no trace of it remains on the products. Meanwhile, the use of ozone gas should
    not exceed a certain threshold, as studies have shown that longer exposure times
    are more effective than ozone concentrations [3]. In recent years, many studies
    recommend the use of ozone gas to control pests and diseases in the agricultural
    industry. In [13], the effects of ozone fungicides on common fungal pathogens
    have been analyzed. Here, the effectiveness of ozone as a disinfectant has been
    demonstrated after the completion of a fungal culture cycle. In [14], the effects
    of ozone water spray on cucumber leaves with severe infection have been evaluated.
    The results of this research showed that ozone water is a partial substitute for
    chemical fungicides and can treat cucumber leaves. In [15], the use of ozone water
    in greenhouse soil disinfection is investigated. The results of this research
    showed that ozone water has a good reducing effect on soil microorganisms and
    nematodes without producing harmful side products. In [16], the inactivation of
    Meloidogyne enterotoxin eggs has been carried out using ozone treatment. The results
    of this research showed that this method significantly reduces the contamination
    of tomato products caused by plant parasitic nematodes. In [15], the effect of
    irrigation with ozonated water on the microbial community has been investigated.
    This work has been done on agricultural physiology in a Mediterranean soil and
    the results show that biomass can reduce bacteria and fungi with intermittent
    irrigation by ozonated water. Light traps attract certain insects and are widely
    used to monitor moths [17]. By using optical traps, they can better control moth
    populations compared to funnel traps. These traps contain two pheromone chambers
    and a lamp, which is a special wavelength light to attract pests [18, 19]. Chemical
    attractants or pheromones may only attract certain species. Using light traps
    at night is very effective to trap the population of this pest. These tools emit
    ultraviolet light, which is called black light [20]. This light is absorbent for
    insects such as flies and moths, and thus an insect that is drawn into the trap
    dies either due to electric discharge or due to falling on a sticky screen [21].
    Recent works recommend the use of optical traps to control pests and diseases
    in the agricultural industry. In [22], a different spectral peak lamp is proposed
    to kill insects at night. Here, a multispectral rotating solar insecticidal lamp
    is developed for rice pest control. In [23], a light source using light emitting
    diode chips is designed that can take into account the differences between different
    insect species. Here, the phototactic response to narrow-wavelength diverse light
    is applied among insects. In [24], a smart lamp was designed to monitor the insect
    population, which has the ability to deal with insect pests. In [25], the control
    range and control effect of an insecticidal lamp on the Asian corn borer are investigated.
    This lamp shows that the effective control distance to the Asian corn borer is
    approximately 60 m and the control area is about 1.1 mm. In [26], the control
    of brown pots has been done by optical traps. The results of this research show
    that a light trap kills millions of destructive brown planthoppers every night.
    The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the connection of a set of objects,
    devices, humans, animals and machines, in which all elements can communicate with
    other elements [27]. In fact, IoT is a connected network consisting of several
    entities that has been able to integrate and integrate the physical and cyber
    worlds with the addition of data processing capabilities and artificial intelligence.
    With the advent of IoT and digital transformation, it is possible to intelligently
    control soil moisture, monitoring the growth of products, as well as preventive
    measures to detect pests [28]. The use of this technology allows access to smart
    agriculture. Remote management of agricultural activities with new technologies
    is a new field for research activities. Plant pests cause the loss of production,
    and this issue is a fundamental problem in many developing countries, bringing
    with it many political, social and economic crises. In recent years, with the
    growth of IoT, hopes have been created for realizing smart agriculture and improving
    the quality and volume of agricultural inputs. In this study, light trap, ozone
    sterilization, and IoT are used to design a system to control insect pests and
    plant diseases. Here, IoT-based wireless sensors are used to collect information
    from the environment. Based on the information received from IoT sensors, a fuzzy
    based routing method is applied to send information. Finally, an IoT-based information
    management system is used to remotely control plant protection devices. The main
    contribution of this paper is as follows: Designing two types of plant preservation
    devices in order to remove chemical toxins during product production: one for
    use in facilities by ozone sterilization and the other for use in farms by light
    trap. Development of a fuzzy-based routing method for energy-aware information
    transfer between IoT sensors Designing an IoT-based information management system
    for remote system control The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section.
    2 introduces plant protection devices. Section 3 is related to the implementation
    process and system performance evaluation. A discussion of the system is given
    in Sect. 4. Finally, the paper ends with conclusions. 2 Architecture and devices
    This section is dedicated to introducing system architecture and devices used
    for plant protection. In addition, in this section, we discuss the details of
    the mobile application and information management system. 2.1 System architecture
    The proposed system for controlling insect pests and plant diseases in the plantation
    includes four parts: plant protection devices, data center, information management
    system, and information transmission unit. Figure 1 shows an overview of the system.
    Here, plant protection devices include field insecticidal plant protection device
    and facility plant protection device. These devices can transfer information to
    the data center using a wireless transmission network. The information management
    system communicates with the data center in real time. This system analyzes the
    information collected by the sensors for quick and intelligent decisions. The
    farmer monitors the growth of crops by remote control of plant protection devices
    and takes preventive measures to detect damages. The mobile application embedded
    in the information management system can apply some real-time settings such as
    the opening of the trap lamp, ozone release, and fan wind speed [28, 29]. According
    to the design, the web-based information management system includes a mobile phone
    application or personal computer application that interacts with the data center.
    In general, all data such as device information, environmental data, and operation
    records are stored in the data center. Fig. 1 Overview of the proposed system
    for pest and disease control in agriculture Full size image As shown in Fig. 2,
    IoT-based system architecture includes four main layers: sensor layer, network
    layer, service management layer, and application layer [30]. Sensor layer In the
    sensor layer, information is received and measured in real time. This layer includes
    sensors, actuators and tags that are connected to each other through a Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN). WSNs are powerful networks that collect information received
    from sensors with low cost and energy consumption. This network tracks and monitors
    agricultural products through various sensors located in agricultural lands that
    are wirelessly connected and send information automatically. The sensors used
    in this layer have the ability to collect defined parameters for pest and disease
    control through sensing the environment. These sensors have the ability to convert
    analog to digital signals and use radio frequency protocol to transmit information.
    Other sensors in this layer include light intensity sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, CO2 sensors, and surveillance cameras. Network layer This
    layer includes the sensor information unit, which is responsible for data processing
    and communication with devices connected to the Internet. Meanwhile, this layer
    can communicate and exchange data with other layers. In fact, in this layer there
    is a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modem [31] connected to the
    Internet, which can send the information received from the WSN sensors to the
    information management system in the service management layer. Hence, the data
    analysis in the proposed system is done by the information management system.
    This layer can support the large amount of data generated by wireless sensors
    and smart devices. Therefore, this layer directs the transmission of data and
    information from IoT-connected sensors to the control infrastructure for storage,
    analysis and processing. Service management layer This layer includes some servers
    for processing and storing collected data. The processing and analysis of this
    data leads to decision-making and the provision of appropriate services. These
    decisions are transferred to the application layer so that the user can perform
    the best operation based on them. In this layer, servers receive requests from
    the application layer and then process them and return their results to the application
    layer. General and dedicated support of some domains and applications is another
    task of the service management layer. Also, this layer makes the data structure
    and the meaning that comes from it understandable. The major part of the service
    management layer is in the platforms that are known as cloud computing and provide
    IoT services. The database is implemented in the proposed architecture based on
    Java + Tomcat + Mysql. In addition, a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connection
    pool, MyBatis middleware, and other technologies are used to realize the query
    [32, 33]. Application layer This layer is very important as the fourth layer of
    tools related to IoT-based plant protection system. This layer includes an application
    platform that the user (farmer) can view and manage its data. An application can
    be an app or a website that runs through a mobile phone or a personal computer.
    These programs provide access to on-demand services. Meanwhile, these programs
    enable real-time system status monitoring and remote control. Also, the application
    layer allows querying data and executing some predefined functions. Fig. 2 Proposed
    IoT-based system architecture for controlling insect pests and plant diseases
    Full size image 2.2 Plant protection devices Devices used for plant protection
    include light trap and ozone sterilization, which are combined with IoT technology.
    These devices are used to collect environmental data, produce ozone, control circuits
    and manage fan speed. There are two plant protection devices in the proposed system:
    field insecticidal plant protection device and facility plant protection device.
    The facility plant protection device is known as an IoT-based machine for controlling
    insect pests and plant diseases. This device can be used to collect environmental
    data, desensitization, sterilization and auxiliary heating. As shown in Fig. 3,
    the facility plant protection device includes sensors, control function, adjusting
    plate, trap lamp, high-speed fan, ozone generator, and some other modules. We
    installed this device on top of a greenhouse that provided high voltage ozone
    generation capability [33]. Due to the high-speed fan in this device, the ozone
    discharge was spread evenly throughout the greenhouse. The results showed no reproduction
    of viruses and oxidation of fungi and bacteria. Also, due to the presence of yellow
    and blue lights in this device, insects were attracted and killed. Fig. 3 Facility
    plant protection device architecture Full size image The field insecticidal plant
    protection device is known as a solar insecticidal lamp based on IoT. As shown
    in Fig. 4, this device includes sensors, solar power supply, control function,
    data transmission unit and insect killer module. This device uses an insect killer
    module that includes a high-speed large-volume fan, an Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
    lamp and a characteristic spectrum to attract insects [34]. The LED lamp in the
    insecticide module has a control radius of about 60 m. In addition, the field
    insecticidal plant protection device has yellow and blue lights to attract insects.
    It is worth noting that the design of this device is such that it does not cause
    any environmental pollution and is suitable for controlling Lepidoptera pests.
    The field insecticidal plant protection device has the ability to collect environmental
    data such as light intensity, humidity, temperature, and crop growth status in
    real time. These data are sent to the information management system through the
    wireless communication network. One of the advantages of this device is the use
    of a power source based on solar panels, which ensures uninterrupted plant protection
    operations. Fig. 4 Field insecticidal plant protection device architecture Full
    size image 2.3 Hardware control circuit In order to control plant protection devices
    (i.e., field insecticidal plant protection device and facility plant protection
    device), we designed a hardware circuit. This circuit includes device interface,
    communication module, sensor interface, and microprocessor. All parts in this
    circuit are controlled by an STM32F103 ARM microprocessor [35]. All received data
    such as light intensity, humidity and temperature are converted into voltage signals
    by the sensor interface and then these signals are processed by the microprocessor.
    According to the results of these processes, plant protection devices are managed
    and controlled. In this circuit, the microprocessor communicates with other modules
    through the device interface. Also, device interface is used to monitor environmental
    data such as light intensity, humidity and temperature in real time. Here, the
    communication module can automatically send the optimal values for the light intensity
    to the information management system. The control circuit in the communication
    module section is equipped with Wi-Fi, which can guarantee remote data transmission
    through a serial port [36]. For remote data transmission, a Wi-Fi communication
    network is embedded in the communication module, which is equipped with a fuzzy-based
    routing protocol. Also, microprocessor uses device interface to control plant
    protection equipment such as video monitoring module, trap lamp, auxiliary heating
    module, fan module, and ozone generation module. On the other hand, the farmer
    can have real-time control over the entire system through the mobile application.
    Figure 5 shows the hardware control circuit designed to control plant protection
    devices. Fig. 5 Hardware control circuit designed for plant protection devices
    Full size image 2.4 Mobile application and information management system An application
    has been designed so that the farmer can remotely control and monitor field insecticidal
    plant protection and facility plant protection devices. This application is designed
    on the Android platform based on the Java language, where it is possible to use
    it on a personal computer with a website. Among the features of this application
    are fan speed adjustment, lamp replacement, device status adjustment, data collection,
    light control and ozone production. The information management system is designed
    to process and store information for plant protection devices. This system is
    web-based and uses browser/server architecture. The three main modules of this
    system include plant protection data management, equipment management, and user
    management. The plant protection data management module is responsible for querying,
    monitoring and alerting plant protection data. If the situation is detected by
    this module as abnormal, it will study the user through alarms and Short Message
    Service (SMS) on the application. The equipment management module includes operations
    such as system operation logs, equipment distribution, equipment maintenance records,
    and setting basic equipment information. Meanwhile, the user management module
    is responsible for managing user/farmer information such as modify user information,
    set user permissions, and add user information. 2.5 Remote control software As
    mentioned, the farmer can adjust, monitor and control the pest and plant protection
    system in real time using a mobile phone application or website. For example,
    turn trap lamp on/off, collect environmental data, set fan wind speed, and perform
    ozone release. For this, we have designed a software based on a mobile application
    and also a web-based information management system. The mobile application-based
    software provides features such as login interface, device registration interface,
    device operation mode interface, and operating device interface. In this software,
    the login interface can show weather conditions. Also, the device registration
    interface includes crop growth information, working environment and basic equipment
    information, which allows the farmer to register plant protection devices. Meanwhile,
    device operation mode interface provides some settings related to plant protection
    devices such as fan speed, ozone intensity, working time for sterilization, and
    working time for pest control. Finally, the operating device interface in the
    designed software provides the possibility of remote control of plant protection
    devices. The designed web-based information management system mainly includes
    machine hardware information, farmer specifications, environmental data, and operation
    records. This system manages plant protection devices to achieve high efficiency.
    2.6 Energy-aware routing protocol based on fuzzy logic In this study, an automatic
    and low-cost plant protection system based on an intelligent energy-aware routing
    protocol is presented. Here, a fast algorithm for data routing using fuzzy logic
    is implemented on the standard Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. The advantages
    of this method include the following: improving the routing process and fast transfer
    of data to the user interface program using fuzzy logic approach, reducing the
    energy consumption of sensors by better managing access to resources and reducing
    additional data transfers, and increasing the speed of data access due to the
    use of fuzzy logic in packet routing. The OSPF protocol has the ability to transition
    from IPv4 to IPv6 and uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm for routing
    [35]. It is a bandwidth-based protocol that we improve with a fuzzy system. The
    network topology details are considered as input based on a series of standard
    parameters. The desired network is a WSN topology and includes a series of IoT
    sensor nodes with the ability to send data. At first, the OSPF protocol is launched
    by sending the “Hello” packet and creating the neighbor table. Here, the communication
    status between the sensor nodes is determined by sending the Link State Acknowledgment
    (LSA) packet and the neighborhood table is created. Each node that received the
    LSA updates its neighbor table and sends an LSA packet to other neighboring nodes.
    After that, the SPF algorithm is developed with a fuzzy approach to create the
    routing table for each node. The OSPF protocol updates its neighbor table when
    changes occur in each node. SPF in OSPF generates routing tables with shortest
    paths through network state information [36]. The cost of links in SPF is measured
    based on an interface, where an interface is the inverse of the bandwidth of a
    link. In addition to bandwidth, various factors are important in routing, such
    as node energy and distance. Therefore, to improve the routing process, a fuzzy
    system is developed considering energy, distance and bandwidth parameters. The
    distance is considered based on the average between the distance of the candidate
    node from the current node and the distance of the candidate node from the destination.
    Therefore, the next node in the path with the fuzzy system is determined based
    on these parameters. Here, the source and destination nodes are known and the
    goal is to find other nodes of the route. The steps of the proposed method for
    data routing are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Steps of the proposed method for data
    routing Full size image Let the network topology consist of \\(N\\) sensor nodes,
    where each node has a limited radio range. Also, the initial energy of all nodes
    is homogeneously equal to \\({E}_{0}\\) Joules, where \\(e_{i} , \\forall i =
    1,2, \\ldots ,N\\) shows the remaining energy of the \\(i\\)-th node. In the process
    of fuzzy routing, \\({node}_{c}\\) is the current node of the route, where it
    is initially set to the source node. In each step, the next \\({node}_{c}\\) is
    selected from among the candidate nodes, i.e., \\(Candid\\left( {node_{c} } \\right)
    = \\left\\{ {node_{j} \\in \\Gamma \\left( {node_{c} } \\right)} \\right\\}\\).
    Here, \\(\\Gamma \\) represents the set of neighboring nodes for a given node.
    A rule-based fuzzy system is used to select a node from \\(Candid\\left( {node_{c}
    } \\right)\\) as the next node in the path. This process is repeated until finally
    the destination node is seen in \\(Candid\\left( {node_{c} } \\right)\\). In the
    designed fuzzy system, the parameters of energy, distance and bandwidth are fuzzified
    based on the trapezoidal fuzzy set. The used trapezoidal phase set is shown in
    Fig. 7. The reasoning behind estimating all parameters is the same. For example,
    we perform fuzzification of the energy parameter (\\(EP\\)) as follows. Meanwhile,
    the output of the fuzzy system is the selection rate of a node as the next node.
    The output value is determined based on the fuzzy rules presented in Table 1,
    which are set by an expert. Here, the membership degree of each input pattern
    is measured using the multiplicative operator. $$ \\mu_{Low} \\left( {EP} \\right)
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 0 \\hfill & {if\\;EP \\ge s} \\hfill \\\\
    {\\frac{s - EP}{{s - r}}} \\hfill & {if\\;r \\le EP < s} \\hfill \\\\ 1 \\hfill
    & {if\\;EP < r} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (1) $$ \\mu_{Middle} \\left(
    {EP} \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 0 \\hfill & {if\\;EP < r} \\hfill

    - EP}{{t - s}}} \\hfill & {if\\;s \\le EP < t} \\hfill \\\\ 0 \\hfill & {if\\;EP
    \\ge t} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (2) $$ \\mu_{High} \\left( {EP}
    \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 0 \\hfill & {if\\;EP < s} \\hfill
    \\\\ {\\frac{EP - s}{{t - s}}} \\hfill & {if\\;s \\le EP < t} \\hfill \\\\ 1 \\hfill
    & {if\\;EP \\ge t} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (3) Fig. 7 Trapezoidal

    Table 1 Fuzzy rules for the proposed routing algorithm Full size table Since data
    transmission between adjacent nodes leads to energy loss, we cluster nodes and
    perform routing between clusters. In this process, the central node of each cluster
    is used for data exchange. For the clustering task, we use a model based on Nonnegative
    Matrix Factorization (NMF), which was presented by Jannesari et al. [34]. 3 Performance
    evaluation This section is related to the implementation and performance evaluation
    of IoT-based plant protection devices in the proposed system. 3.1 System implementation
    Plant protection system designed in China is used. This system is widely used
    to control insect pests and plant diseases in crops. For example, this system
    can be used to control the production of products such as rice and cucumber. Figure
    8 shows some actual applications of existing devices in the designed plant protection
    system. Fig. 8 Field and real applications of plant protection devices. a Scenarios
    of field insecticidal plant protection device, and b scenarios of facility plant
    protection device Full size image 3.2 System application The proposed system adjusts
    environmental parameters within optimal limits so that it is not dangerous for
    the environment. Basically, the designed system includes some settings that can
    be applied by the farmer to control the environmental data. Examples of the results
    of strength of illumination (Lx), air humidity (RH), and air temperature (°C)
    are shown in Fig. 9. These results can help the farmer to make decisions. For
    example, the farmer can use this information to better monitor and control diseases
    and pests in real time. Also, based on this data, the farmer can adjust the working
    mode of the plant protection devices in time using the mobile phone application.
    Fig. 9 Environmental data collected by IoT sensors. a Results related to strength
    of illumination, b results related to air humidity, and c results related to air
    temperature Full size image 3.3 Analyzing the effectiveness of plant protection
    system We tested the proposed plant protection system on several crops to investigate
    the effects of insect pests and diseases on plants. In this experiment, five independent
    greenhouses are considered to compare the plant protection system. On each greenhouse,
    we tested three disease control techniques: no treatment, spray chemical pesticides,
    and release of ozone by the proposed system. It is worth noting that other daily
    measures such as fertilizer and water are the same in all five greenhouses. In
    all the greenhouses, we activated the plant protection device from 7 pm to 6 am.
    We monitored the fan air volume and ozone release amount using the mobile app,
    where the fan wind intensity is set to 70% and the ozone release rate is set to
    20%. Five-point sampling technique has been used to evaluate the rate of pest
    and disease observation. According to this technique, disease incidence is equal
    to the ratio of ND (number of diseased leaves) to NT (total number of leaves).
    The results of this experiment for three disease control techniques in five selected
    greenhouses are according to Table 2. Here, the evaluation results for crop species
    such as Cabbage, Celery, Cowpea, Tomato, and Cucumber are given. The results presented
    are based on the average for five greenhouses. The rates of cabbage damping-off,
    gray mold, celery early blight, cowpea gray mold, tomato leaf mold, and cucumber
    powdery mildew with plant protection system was 1.75%, 9.53% 6.36%, 16.71%, and
    12.31% lower than chemical pesticides, respectively. Also, the results show that
    the rate of diseases with ozone has decreased by more than 10% and the rate of
    diseases with chemical pesticides has decreased by less than 2% compared to the
    no treatment scenario. Meanwhile, ozone has no adverse effect on the natural growth
    of crops. Table 2 Efficiency results of three disease control techniques in five
    considered greenhouses Full size table 3.4 Energy consumption analysis To evaluate
    the energy consumption in IoT-based devices, we use the energy consumption model
    according to [37] to send and receive data. According to this model, the amount
    of energy consumption for wireless sensors when sending and receiving data is
    calculated by Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively. $$ E_{tx} \\left( d \\right) = \\left\\{
    {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {E_{elec} \\times l + \\varepsilon_{fs} \\times l \\times
    d^{2} ,} \\hfill & {d > d_{0} } \\hfill \\\\ {E_{elec} \\times l + \\varepsilon_{mp}
    \\times l \\times d^{4} ,} \\hfill & {d \\le d_{0} } \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array}
    } \\right. $$ (4) $$ E_{rx} = E_{elec} * l $$ (5) where \\(d\\) and \\({d}_{0}\\)
    are the distance and distance threshold (as the maximum power level) between the
    sending and receiving sensors, respectively [38, 39]. \\(E_{tx}\\) indicates the
    energy consumption for the packet sender and \\(E_{rx}\\) indicates the energy
    consumption for the packet receiver. \\(E_{elec}\\) is the energy required to
    send/receive one bit of data, which is considered equal to 50 nJ/bit. \\(l\\)
    Packet size in bytes. Also, \\(\\varepsilon_{mp}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{fs}\\)
    are defined as the energy of the amplifier to amplify the signal, which are considered
    equal to 10 pJ/bit/m2 and 0.0013 pJ/bit/m4, respectively [40]. In another experiment,
    we evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy-based routing method for energy
    consumption. In this experiment, the total residual energy from all sensors in
    the network is reported after each round of routing. In addition to the proposed
    fuzzy routing method, we measured the energy consumption results of the designed
    system with LEACH and OSPF routing protocols. Figure 10 compares the energy consumption
    results for these methods during 5000 routing rounds. In the first round of simulation,
    the total remaining energy of the sensors is equal to 20 J, where the energy of
    the network decreases with increasing rounds of routing. However, the proposed
    fuzzy method for routing has less energy consumption than LEACH and OSPF protocols.
    Fig. 10 Comparison of energy consumption during routing in different methods Full
    size image 4 Discussions The quantitative and qualitative increase in the demand
    for food has multiplied the necessity of moving towards the industrialization
    of agriculture. According to the reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations, the food needs of the growing population of the earth in
    2050 will grow by 70% compared to 2006. With the increasing growth of technology
    and with the aim of increasing agricultural productivity, various tools have emerged.
    One of the results of the growth of technology in the agricultural sector is intelligence,
    which can answer part of the problems of this industry. Despite the fact that
    many farmers are unaware of this technology, its application and benefits, but
    the limited use of new technologies plays a very important role in increasing
    production. Meanwhile, the agricultural industry has made significant progress
    in recent years, using communication and information technologies, especially
    IoT. With the use of IoT, farmers can receive relevant information using smartphones
    and the Internet at any time and place. Smart agriculture technology increases
    the yield in the same time and conditions as traditional agriculture. Today, many
    related industries on the way to smart agriculture have used this technology due
    to its obvious features such as saving time, cost and human intervention. The
    work of communication and information technology in the agricultural sector is
    to transfer relevant information to different sectors of this industry. In this
    regard, we developed a routing method based on fuzzy logic, which can transmit
    the information gathered by IoT sensors, taking energy into account. By using
    various wireless sensors and tools, the farmer can quickly access the information
    related to the different stages of production. One of the most important concerns
    of mankind today is the contamination of agricultural soils by various chemical
    pollutants, especially poisons. This issue is one of the important challenges
    of agricultural development and it will potentially face a problem. Meanwhile,
    mankind has turned to the increasing use of chemical fertilizers and poisons in
    order to gain more economic benefits. All agricultural chemicals contain additives
    and although the amount of poison in them is low, they can have destructive effects.
    Therefore, the intelligent management of pesticides in agriculture is a targeted
    system to deal with damage in agricultural lands. In recent years, with the introduction
    of information and communication technologies, the field of pest and disease control
    through alternative methods has been provided. The sensors embedded in this system
    are the basis of intelligent pest and disease control management. Today, ozone
    sterilization and light traps are new techniques to control pests and diseases
    in farms. The advantages of these techniques are: preventing environmental pollution
    and resistance to diseases, implementing the system at any time according to the
    need, not depending on factors such as the amount and variety of toxins, running
    the system for a long time, reducing production costs such as buying pesticides,
    not needing manpower for spraying, simultaneous use of ozone sterilization tools
    and light traps in several places, and the convenience of using the system remotely.
    5 Conclusions Among the methods of pest control, the effects of chemical poisons
    for humans have been revealed, which has had a great impact on disrupting the
    natural balance in agricultural ecosystems. Awareness of the ecosystem and the
    progress made in different methods of pest control will reduce the population
    of pests or their harmful effects tolerable. Due to the high value of agricultural
    products and production costs, pest damage and plant diseases have a higher economic
    value. Hence, farmers are always looking for a decisive fight against these factors.
    In this study, a system for controlling pests and diseases in agricultural crops
    was presented by combining objects, fuzzy logic, light trap and ozone sterilization.
    This system eliminates the need to use chemical poisons during product production
    as much as possible. Real-time information is collected by IoT devices and sent
    to the destination through a path embedded with fuzzy logic. The information management
    system can be used remotely to control the system. Real-time monitoring of diseases
    and pests as well as precise control of ozone concentration are considered as
    future works. Data availability Not applicable. References Dong, Y., Xu, F., Liu,

    1. Introduction The things that we use are generating more data than ever before.
    However, this vast amount of data is noisy, inconsistent and has variable rate
    flows, as well as other characteristics commonly named 5Vs [1]. Thus, in an Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) ecosystem, first, the data is collected, and then it must be cleaned and
    organised before being used and integrated with other sources of data, enabling
    the so-called Smart Solutions. However, IoT device manufacturers tend to apply
    their proprietary data models, APIs and platforms in their portfolio of products
    and systems, as well as IoT data also tend to be organised in silos, making it
    difficult to reuse it in interoperable smart solutions. In many cases, their devices
    are dependent on solutions based on the software as a service (SaaS) model, thus
    causing some restrictions on the type of device due to hardware compatibilities,
    as well other limitations such as access control management, potential software
    and hardware vulnerabilities, periodic payment of licenses and limited access
    to sensor data for analysis [2]. To address these problems, the European Commission
    has funded several projects (e.g., FIWARE, FI-Core, FI-Next, SmartSDK) either
    for developing and enhancing the FIWARE,1 a Future Internet (FI) platform, as
    well as using it in pilots, such as City Platform as a Service - CPaaS.io2 [3].
    The goal of these initiatives is the creation of an open, sustainable ecosystem
    around public, royalty-free and implementation-driven software platform standards,
    easing the development of smart solutions and supporting organisations in their
    transition into smart organisations, thus enabling the development of solutions
    free of that lock-in vendor strategy and benefitting from data interoperability.
    One of the notable aspects of the FIWARE ecosystem is its API based on the Next
    Generation Service Interfaces (NGSI) standard, which evolved from a set of specifications
    [4] originally issued by the Open Mobile Alliance™ (http://www.openmobilealliance.org).
    Although those NGSI-based systems, and others, enable large volumes of IoT data
    to be generated and used in business processes in several use cases of data analytics,
    this is not always a simple task. According to Plazas et al. [5], traditional
    data-driven business intelligence might not be enough to compete in the context
    of Industry 4.0 since the collection and analysis of data from the IoT requires
    a more responsive approach. In [6], is presented an industrial case study in which
    are identified two limitations in the data analytic processes: (1) Automation
    - the processes are very dependent on the manual intervention based on MS Excel
    files; and (2) Scalability – due to lack of integration and support for large
    volumes of data when using MS Excel. Regarding the first limitation, the authors
    observed that the lack of automation leads to a considerable manual effort for
    end-users to build, adapt and apply analytic processes over IoT data, thus being
    very time-consuming for them. Self-service business intelligence and analytics
    tools, such as Power BI, Tableau and Qlik, empower non-technical users to create
    reports and analyses without depending on IT teams [7] and significant cost savings
    [8], thus addressing some of the mentioned problems of lack of automation and
    work productivity. We notice that, according to Gartner, some of those analytic
    tools (Power BI, Tableau and Qlik) are market leaders, providing collaborative,
    self-service and user-friendly visual analytic capabilities, enabling non-technical
    users to explore data and get insights by developing low-code or no-code, automation
    workflows and applications [9]. As found in the literature, the support for self-service
    data analytic tools is available through several FIWARE Generic Enablers. However,
    these solutions are designed for big data environments, are complex, and generally
    store context data in backend databases or include their own visual data analytic
    features. When using self-service visual analytic tools, final users must connect
    to these backend databases, which may pose problems of access control management
    and other security issues because, in general, due to security policies, the set
    of users/systems that can access backend database systems is very restricted.
    Furthermore, the specific data models of these FIWARE components may also be too
    complex to be used by non-expert users. Thus, with the use of this type of tool
    to explore IoT data, the aforementioned limitations (in terms of responsive approaches
    [5] and automation [6]) are just partially mitigated because despite how easy
    it is to use these visual analytic tools to build analytic dashboards, the access
    to IoT data could continue to be a major problem. The present research work began
    with the formulation of the following research question: RQ – Which is the best
    approach for enabling end-users who are not IT and IoT experts to develop data
    analytic processes in NGSI-based ecosystems using self-service visual data analytic
    tools? In this research work, a Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) [10,11]
    was used. In order to address those issues and answer our research question RQ,
    we propose a middleware that provides a table-oriented structure view of IoT entities’
    data in the current state and their history over time. The proposed system operates
    in any IoT ecosystem using the dialects NGSI-V2 and NGSI-TSDB, or NGSI-LD. With
    the present work, we expect to contribute to demonstrating the need for such type
    of component in the FIWARE catalogue, as well as making it freely available to
    the community.3 In the following section, a short overview of the FIWARE ecosystem
    is presented. In Section 3, the existing solutions based on FIWARE components
    (Generic Enablers) that provide means for developing analytic processes are discussed.
    Section 4 presents the methodology used in the present work. In Section 5, the
    proposed system is presented in terms of architecture, features and interfacing.
    Next, in Section 6, the system is evaluated based on an educational use case,
    in which students develop Power BI dashboards, RapidMiner analytic processes and
    PySpark-based programmes directedly connected to the IoT ecosystem using the proposed
    prototype. The paper is finished with the presentation of conclusions and future
    work proposals. 2. FIWARE ecosystem 2.1. Context brokers In a FIWARE ecosystem,
    the context broker plays a major role in allowing the management of the entire
    lifecycle of context information, including updates, queries, registrations and
    subscriptions. It provides a REST API based on the Next Generation Service Interfaces
    (NGSI) standards [12,13], with two possible communication models: (1) Subscription/notification
    [14] and (2) Forwarding. Depending on the version of the NGSI supported by the
    broker API, some operations may not be available, as well as a broker may not
    implement the entire NGSI specification in the used version. A context broker
    should be designed to provide means to produce, gather, publish and consume context
    data at a large scale and exploit it, thus enabling the reuse of IoT data over
    applications and platforms, aiming to transform solutions into truly smart applications
    [15]. In the FIWARE catalogue [15], one can find the context brokers Orion [16,17],
    Scorpio [18] and Stellio [19]. Currently, the Orion has two implementations: (1)
    Orion [16], based on NGSI-V2 [13], and (2) Orion Context Broker with Linked Data
    Extensions – Orion LD [17], based on NGSI-LD [12,20]. Both Scorpio and Stellio
    context brokers are based on NGSI-LD. The NGSI-V2 is in maintenance mode, while
    the NGSI-LD specification is regularly updated and published by the European Telecommunications
    Standardization Institute (ETSI)4. At the present date, the latest specification
    is in version 1.7.1 [20], which was published in June 2023. Despite Orion LD,
    Scorpio and Stellio having distinct levels of implementation of the NGSI-LD specification,
    at the present date, they are aligned with version 1.6.1. However, it is important
    to note that Orion LD does not implement the NGSI-LD-based temporal API. As part
    of FIWARE, several components of a catalogue, also named Generic Enablers, are
    available for dealing with three main aspects: (1) interfacing with the IoT devices,
    robots and third-party systems; (2) context Data/API management, publication,
    and monetisation; and (3) processing, analysis and visualisation of context information
    [15]. Since the communication model is based on the NGSI standard, this approach
    enables and encourages the growth of the catalogue in terms of the number of Generic
    Enablers developed by a community of members and partners, as well as its evolution
    in terms of the development of portable and interoperable smart solutions in several
    Smart* domains, such as Smart Cities, Smart Industry, Smart Energy and Smart Water.
    Thus, the context broker and generic enablers can be assembled together and combined
    with other third-party platform components to build new applications, easing the
    development of those smart solutions. In Section 3, we will discuss some of these
    components that are related to our work. Context data is represented through values
    assigned to attributes that characterise the entities which are relevant to applications.
    An entity is a Digital Twin which digitally represents a real-world physical asset
    (e.g., a bus in a city, a milling machine in a factory) or a concept (e.g., a
    weather forecast, a product order). In FIWARE with linked data extensions, each
    Digital Twin: (1) is universally identified with a URI (Universal Resource Identifier);
    (2) belongs to a well-known type (e.g., the Bus type or the Room type) also universally
    identified by a URI and (3) is characterised by several attributes, which in turn
    are classified as Properties, holding data (e.g., the “current speed” of a Bus,
    or “max temperature” in a Room), and Relationships [21]. The data of these entities
    can be obtained from several types of sources, such as existing systems and users,
    through mobile apps or sensor networks. The context broker mediates the interactions
    applied to data entities in contexts, making them available through REST APIs.
    These interactions can be CRUD operations over context data, including geolocation
    queries, subscription of changes on data or performing the registration of external
    entities following an approach very similar to a proxy mechanism. To persist data
    about the entities and other functional aspects, the context broker uses a database
    such as MongoDB,5 PostgreSQL6 or TimescaleDB7 (in the case of Orion/Orion LD,
    Scorpio and Stellio). Additionally, both Scorpio and Stellio also use Kafka8 to
    decouple communication inside the broker. Fig. 6 presents a simplified overview
    of the architecture of these ecosystems. Regarding security, the Orion context
    broker does not provide native security and authentication mechanisms, requiring
    additional components. As far as we know, this is also the case with Scorpio,
    where these issues are still on the roadmap.9 In the case of Stellio, an API for
    authentication is available. 2.2. NGSI and context information management (CIM)
    In NGSI-V2, the entities are represented in JSON. On the other hand, the NGSI-LD
    standard is an extended subset of JSON-LD [22] to define entities and their relationships.
    Thus, in terms of data modelling, the NGSI-V2 is simpler than NGSI-LD because
    the latter follows the layered approach with three levels of data abstraction,
    following the Context Information Management (CIM) model [20]. The current information
    model of CIM is based on RDF [23] standards to capture high-level relations between
    entities and properties of entities. The model''s objects are RDF subclasses following
    the structure presented in Fig. 1 (e.g., NGSI-LD Entity, Relationship, and Property
    are subclasses of rdfs:Resource [24]). Download : Download high-res image (528KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Cross-domain NGSI-LD Information Model
    (source: [12]). As mentioned, the CIM model defines three levels of data abstraction.
    At the first level, the NGSI-LD Core Meta Model represents the real world''s entities
    (things and concepts). The attributes can be of two types: Properties and Relationships
    (in NGSI-V2, the attributes have values and associated metadata). The entities
    are represented as objects using JSON-LD, thus contextualising data and respecting
    compliance with other linked data. Each entity should specify a @context statement
    for binding the data representation to a vocabulary supporting the upper abstraction
    data layers. These vocabularies linked to entity instances are published. Fig.
    2, on the right, presents an example of this bind. Download : Download high-res
    image (396KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. TemperatureSensor entity
    in NGSI-V2 and NGSI-LD. At the second level of data abstraction, cross-domain
    ontology provides commonly used constructs, such as time, geographical location
    and language, which generally apply to many domains. The top layer extends the
    previous one by defining domain-specific ontologies in any domain such as industry,
    building, cities or agriculture. In short, the cross-domain layer aims to describe
    common concepts, situations or constraints to avoid redefining them separately
    (and probably in a different way) in each domain-specific ontology. In Fig. 1,
    these common concepts in ontology are illustrated. For instance, in the case of
    geo localisation, the model aims to distinguish between (a) the location of the
    entity, (b) its observation space and (c) operation space. For example, a camera
    located in a geographical point can observe a certain space, distinct from its
    localisation. Another example is a crane that has a location but can operate in
    a certain operation space. We should notice that this layer can also be represented
    in NGSI-V2 by means of a metadata dictionary, but it does not ensure the interoperability
    of these metadata, as we will discuss next. Fig. 2 presents an example of an entity
    in both formats, NGSI-V2 and NGSI-LD, which helps to clarify these differences.
    Comparing the two data structures in the example, one can find three main differences
    between them: (1) In NGSI-LD, the identifier (id) of the entity contains the prefix
    “urn:ngsi-ld”; (2) in NGSI-V2, each attribute contains a dictionary of metadata
    properties, in case of “temperature” the property unitCode, while in NGSI-LD this
    metadata is standardised, in our example the unitCode for expressing units and
    observedAt for expressing timestamps; and (3) in NGSI-LD, there is an additional
    element @context. This element references the NGSI-LD Meta-Model, providing an
    unambiguous definition and allowing the systems to interpret the attributes with
    more clarity and depth, avoiding needing a metadata dictionary of properties,
    as in the case of NGSI-V2. For the given example, the domain-specific specification
    of the temperature attribute (available at https://smartdatamodels.org/dataModel.Environment/temperature)
    defines it as a property of type number. We should note that there are other differences
    between the standards, such as the NGSI-V2 geo:json type, which has been renamed
    to GeoProperty. In [25], one can find more information about this issue. It is
    desirable that these ontologies should be globally accepted in order to guarantee
    the interoperability of applications. The FIWARE Smart Data Models initiative,10
    launched by the FIWARE Foundation, provides a library of data models based on
    JSON/JSON-LD. Data models published under the initiative are compatible with schema.org
    and comply with other existing de-facto sectoral standards when they exist [21].
    The Smart Data Models initiative aims to define a harmonised representation of
    formats and semantics that will be used by applications both to consume and publish
    data. Such interoperable data structures enable Data Spaces in which data may
    be shared across applications as-is on those Smart* domains referred to above
    [21,26]. In NGSI-LD, a temporal API that enables the management of entities’ historical
    data was introduced. Using this API, users can apply several types of temporal
    criteria to obtain time series regarding the entities’ attributes in passed states.
    For the case of NGSI-V2-based brokers, such as Orion, and those that do not implement
    the NGSI-LD-based temporal API, such as Orion LD, additional mechanisms (based
    on NGSI-TSDB) are required to manage the entities’ historical data. The following
    section will discuss how this issue is handled in the FIWARE ecosystem. 3. Related
    work In order to find related literature that presents approaches for implementing
    data analytic processes in NGSI-based ecosystems, a systematic literature review
    (SLR) methodology was used. At the Identification step, the following search string
    was applied to electronic scientific databases suggested in [27] and others also
    available in the search engine (http://www.b-on.pt/) used by the author. The result
    of this search was updated on January 24, 2024. After removing all duplicates,
    twelve papers were selected. Due to the low number of papers, no additional inclusion
    and exclusion criteria were imposed. In the Screening step, all the papers’ abstracts
    were read and analysed by the author in order to verify their relevance to this
    study. All papers that propose an approach for supporting data analytics over
    IoT data were considered eligible. On the other hand, the papers that only discuss
    the capabilities of FIWARE components were not eligible. Thus, only eleven papers
    were selected for the present research work. The founded literature suggests that
    there are two main categories of approaches for implementing data analytic processes
    supported on NGSI-based ecosystems. The first category, [28], [29], [30], [31],
    [32] present systems that implement their own analytic modules, which interact
    directly with the context broker for obtaining data; in these cases, the Orion
    context broker and NGSI-LD-based context brokers in the latter case. These studies
    were not included in the present work because they address a distinct problem
    from the one stated in RQ. On the other hand, the proposals in the second category
    of papers use FIWARE components to implement data streams and data sinks, which
    feed backend databases or build static replicas of the IoT data. This data is
    then used by the analytic modules. These six papers, [33], [34], [35], [36], [37],
    [38], are discussed next. In [34], an IoT cloud-based solution for controlling
    power quality in energy management systems is presented. In the proposed system,
    IoT data is managed by the Orion context broker and Quantumleap [39] for historical
    data. At the data layer, the databases MongoDB and CreateDB handle the persistence
    of data. Also, in the energetic sector, Haghgoo et al. [37] present a cloud-based
    platform for analysing power distribution. This approach is similar to the previous
    one, using the same FIWARE components. In [38], a third use case in the energetic
    sector, the authors present a system based on Orion context broker and STH Comet
    [40], another FIWARE component for supporting data persistence. The collected
    data is then used by analytic modules. Munoz-Arcentales et al. [36] propose an
    open-source reference implementation for providing context-aware data analytics
    capabilities to IoT-based smart environments. The authors’ proposal is based on
    the Orion LD context broker, Draco [41], Cosmos [42] and other FIWARE components
    for data visualisation and applications to develop operational dashboards which
    are highly customisable by end-users. Frangella et al. [35] propose a FIWARE-based
    IoT architecture for supporting real-time data acquisition and enabling the creation
    of a digital twin. The proposed system is based on FIWARE Cygnus [43], a connector
    between Orion Context Broker and other external systems, such as databases. In
    the authors’ proposal, a MySQL database supports the data used in the analytic
    processes. In [33], the data analytics are supported by a distributed file system
    that saves information among several machines. The authors have employed the Hadoop
    Distributed File System (HDFS) for this purpose. Another FIWARE component, the
    Cygnus [43], is in charge of taking data records from the context broker and saving
    them in Hadoop. Then, a data analytics module uses the data stored in the Hadoop.
    We observed that in these related works, the analytic modules are based on FIWARE
    components to collect and store IoT data in backend databases or data repositories.
    This data is then used by analytic modules based on other components, such as
    Apache Spark, Grafana or Wirecloud. We claim that, in the same way, these databases
    can be consumed by end-users using self-service visual data analytic tools for
    implementing the data analytics processes as they require. Therefore, in order
    to systematise our discussion, we will continue to focus on these FIWARE components
    that provide means for supporting any type of analytic module. Depending on the
    NGSI version, the context broker manages the historical data on distinct approaches.
    Thus, we start the discussion from the perspective of the historical data entity
    management in order to store it in backend databases or export it as datasets.
    Next, the available means for end-users to extract IoT data are discussed. This
    section is finished by discussing the limitations found in these related works.
    3.1. Management of historical data of entities The NGSI-V2-based context brokers,
    such as Orion, provide means for managing data entities at the current state of
    their twins. In order to preserve and manage the history of the spatial-temporal
    context data, the FIWARE catalogue has available components that can be added
    to solutions, providing them with both views: the current state of context data
    and the historical state in the form of time series [15]. On the other hand, the
    NGSI-LD standard includes the specification of a temporal API, thus eliminating
    the need for additional components for managing historical data relating to the
    past states of entities. However, as mentioned above, the NGSI-LD-based context
    broker Orion LD does not implement this temporal API. The Cygnus Generic Enabler
    [43] provides the means for creating a historical view of the context by injecting
    streams of data into multiple data sinks, including some popular databases like
    PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB or AWS DynamoDB, as well as big data platforms such
    as Hadoop, Storm, Spark or Flink [15]. Internally, Cygnus is based on Apache Flume11.
    This is a data flow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming that
    supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation,
    and system mediation logic, enabling the automation of data flows between systems.
    Draco [41] provides the means for persisting historical context data for big data
    analysis. It is developed on top of Apache NiFi12, which supports powerful and
    scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation
    logic. One of the several possible scenarios consists of using the NGSIToMySQL
    processor in order to persist data into a MySQL database. In short, Draco subscribes
    to NGSI events that are attended by a flow implemented using components of types
    connector, controller and processor, such as NGSIToMySQL, NGSIToPostgreSQL or
    NGSIToMongo. This tool also provides a GUI that helps users to build the flow
    processes. The Cosmos Generic Enabler is a set of tools that help achieve streaming
    and batch processing tasks over context data. At the moment, users can implement
    processes based on Spark and Flink. The data can be collected from the context
    broker by means of the subscription of changes, as NGSI events, and as a data
    source. This approach enables historical context data to be handled as needed
    in analytic tools. Additionally, it provides expert users with all the power of
    these platforms (Spark and Flink) in order to generate datasets that can be used
    by non-technical users. The FIWARE PySpark Connector proposes an approach for
    data bridging between the context broker and PySpark. This connector includes
    a parser function that enables the creation of NGSIv2 and NGSI-LD entities ready
    to use in a custom PySpark algorithm. However, the support for NGSI-LD temporal
    API is still in the long-term roadmap. Thus, the system must subscribe to changes
    in the context broker and store data in a repository or database to keep the several
    states of each entity. Like in the previous cases, datasets can be produced to
    be consumed by end-users. Orion-LD implements the Temporal Representation of Entities
    (TRoE) in an experimental state [17], taking care of populating the TRoE databases.
    Despite temporal operations being part of NGSI-LD API specification [44], when
    invoking a temporal query, one receives the message: “Not Implemented in Orion-LD,
    please use Mintaka for this operation”. The Mintaka13 component handles the temporal
    queries by implementing the NGSI-LD temporal retrieval API. It relies on the Orion-LD
    Context Broker and a TimescaleDB installation (including the Postgis extension)
    that Orion-LD populates. QuantumLeap [39] Generic Enabler is an alternative to
    STH Comet [40]. Both can store entity history as time series data. It allows the
    raw data to be queried and aggregates to be calculated. QuantumLeeap and STH Comet
    get the entity data via context broker subscription notifications. The QuantumLeap
    persist data into time-series databases, such as CrateDB and Timescale, but is
    prepared to support multiple types of backend. It provides a REST API service,
    named NGSI-TSDB [45], for storing, querying and retrieving NGSI-V2 and NGSI-LD
    (experimental support) spatial-temporal data. In contrast, STHComet does not support
    NGSI-V2/NGSI-LD, nor multiple database backends, being strongly tied to MongoDB.
    3.2. Data bridging As discussed in the previous section, both the current state
    and historical data of entities are stored in backend databases following a data
    model specific to the platform (e.g., QuantumLeap) or designed by an IoT expert.
    This data is then available to be used by self-service visual analytic tools.
    However, this approach may suffer from two limitations when end-users need to
    consume these data: (1) they become dependent on the data model, which may not
    include all entities and/or attributes, or it may be complex to this user profile;
    (2) another problem regards to security restrictions that may exist to connect
    to the backends databases. In general, these systems are not accessible to end-users,
    posing access control management problems. In the FIWARE catalogue, we find five
    combinations of components that allow the consumption of the current state and
    historical data of entities using NGSI-based interfaces to connect the analytic
    tools. Table 1 presents these combinations: Table 1. Combinations of generic enablers.

    specifications and implementations Scorpio / NGSI-LD The broker supports temporal
    NGSI-LD API Stellio / NGSI-LD The broker supports temporal NGSI-LD API NGSI-LD
    specification version 1.7.1 was published in June 2023. Using one of these combinations
    of RESTful-based APIs, one can consume context data by connecting a self-service
    analytic tool capable of ingesting JSON, thus bypassing the security and data
    model issues referred to above. However, there is an object-relational impedance
    mismatch between the JSON structures provided by these APIs and the table-oriented
    structures in general required by analytics tools. Thus, the user must manually
    define an ETL process to transform complex JSON (NGSI) into one or more tables.
    This scenario is not feasible, even for experienced users. Next, this problem
    is discussed in detail. The NGSI V2/LD APIs provide an optional parameter for
    defining their output JSON format variant as normalised, key/value (simplified),
    or, in the case of NGSI-LD, as concise format [46,47]. In short, these format
    variations differ in terms of metadata details. In the simplified format, context
    data properties are provided in a plain and simple structure very similar to tabular,
    enabling a simple ETL process for data ingestion. Fig. 3 depicts an example of
    a Person entity composed of five properties and one relationship (spouse) to another
    Person. In this simple format, only the values of attributes (property or relationship)
    are presented, but the metadata is not available. Download : Download high-res
    image (148KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Simplified format (source:
    [46]). On the other hand, the normalised format (presented in Fig. 4) provides
    additional metadata such as type, unitCode, observedAt, createdAt and others,
    which enrich the data to be consumed. However, in this case, the ETL design process
    is not trivial and is very time-consuming. Download : Download high-res image
    (227KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Normalized format (source:
    [46]). This impedance problem is much more problematic in the case of NGSI-TSDB
    and temporal NGSI-LD. In these APIs, time series are represented in the scope
    of its context entity JSON object as arrays of timestamps and values for each
    attribute. Fig. 5 depicts a small part of NGSI-TSDB API specification, in which
    one can observe pairs of time stamps and values of an attribute following the
    same order in separate arrays. The temporal NGSI-LD API follows a similar approach
    using the EntityTemporalList and EntityTemporal data structures [20]. Thus, it
    is very complex, if not impossible, for final users to implement an analytic process
    supported by Power BI or similar tools. Indeed, it becomes particularly problematic
    in the case of different numbers of samples from one entity or attribute to another.

    object. 3.3. Current limitations in NGSI-based ecosystems for data analytics As
    far as we know, the main approaches for implementing data analytics in NGSI-based
    ecosystems are based on FIWARE components that persist data in backend databases
    or other types of storage, such as HDFS. This data is then used by the analytic
    modules to produce data visualisations and all types of analysis, as well as it
    can also be consumed by self-service visual data analytic tools to produce outputs
    according to the users’ needs. We consider that the use of these self-service
    visual tools presents a significative advantage over those related works that
    provide pre-defined or customisable dashboards. Using these tools, end-users have
    the ability to develop any type of dashboard as much as they need. Of course,
    nothing prevents the two approaches from coexisting and even complementing each
    other. However, despite all the advantages of those self-service visual tools,
    easy and flexible access to data could still be a major challenge in such environments.
    We present two drawbacks: (1) When using these tools, end-users must connect to
    those backend databases, which may pose problems with access control management
    and other security issues because, in general, due to security policies, the set
    of users/systems that can access backend database systems is very restricted;
    (2) Another problem, regards to the high complexity for end-users. The specific
    data models of the FIWARE components in some cases are complex (e.g., Stellio
    or Scorpio) or do not follow the relational model (e.g., MongoDB in the case of
    Orion/Orion LD), thus making end-users dependent on IT and IoT experts. Therefore,
    in scenarios of local enterprise IoT-based solutions (e.g., Industrial and Agricultural),
    these components may not be well-suitable for analytical processes based on those
    self-service tools. 4. Methodology Considering the nature of the addressed problem
    and the research question RQ, the used methodology applies the Design Science
    Research (DSR) method [10] following the Hevner et al. guidelines [11]. This methodology
    used to define, implement, and validate the proposed system comprises the following
    activities: 4.1. Activity 1: problem identification and motivation The author
    of the present work intends to solve a practical problem of end-users (who are
    not IT or IoT experts) when developing analytics processes, such as IoT data visualisations.
    The context of this work is the FIWARE-based ecosystems or any others that provide
    NGSI-based mechanisms for interoperability. Thus, the research question RQ was
    formulated: Which is the best approach for enabling end-users who are not IT and
    IoT experts to develop data analytic processes in NGSI-based ecosystems using
    self-service visual data analytic tools? Answering this question by proposing
    a new FIWARE component, the limitations found in the related works can be overcome
    because this new system can help end-users extract IoT data and develop analytics
    processes, autonomously without relying on IT or IoT experts. 4.2. Activity 2:
    define the objectives for a solution As previously mentioned, the developed artefact
    should enable end-users to obtain IoT data from NGSI-based ecosystems on-demand
    and develop analytics processes without the help of IT or IoT experts. This objective
    encompasses the following requirements for the artefact to be developed: (1) A
    fast learning curve for using the proposed system; (2) simple mapping between
    IoT entities and extracted data; (3) a standard interface enabling the support
    for self-service visual analytics tool and (4) overcome the control access limitations
    of backend systems usually imposed by security policies. The present objectives
    are qualitative. At this stage, quantitative objectives, such as system performance
    indicators, are not considered. 4.3. Activity 3: design and development In this
    activity, the artefact is created. Section 5 discusses the developed prototype
    of a data bridge for connecting self-service end-user analytic tools to NGSI-based
    IoT systems. 4.4. Activity 4: demonstration In Section 6.1, a set of experiments
    and results are presented. We argue that these presented results demonstrate that
    the developed artefact addresses the stated problem in RQ. 4.5. Activity 5: evaluation
    This activity complements the previous one, observing and measuring how well the
    artefact supports a solution to the problem. This activity involves comparing
    the objectives of a solution to actual observed results from the use of the artefact
    in the demonstration. Thus, in Section 6.2, the results of the experiments presented
    in Section 6.1 are compared with the objectives formulated in Section 4.2, as
    well as its limitations are discussed in Section 6.3. 4.6. Activity 6. communication
    In this last activity, the problem and its importance, the artefact, its utility
    and novelty, the rigour of its design, and its effectiveness are communicated

    5. Proposed system In this section, is presented a lightweight data bridge that
    accelerates the ETL process creation in table-oriented self-service data analytic
    tools, providing a simple and uniform API that non-technical end-users can use
    to consume IoT data on-demand and build their analytic no-code processes in Power
    BI, Tableau, Qlik or any other analytic tool capable of ingest table-oriented
    data in JSON or CSV. Using the proposed prototype, end-users can select their
    own datasets according to their needs, applying temporal, geolocation and other
    selection criteria for filtering context data stored in NGSI-based platforms in
    the combinations presented in Table 1. They can optimise data loading and transformation
    processes by applying differential loading approaches in terms of temporal and
    geolocation. These filter capabilities are particularly important in big data
    use cases due to large volumes of context data and increments of data produced
    in real-time by IoT devices. The prototype supports JSON and CSV output formats
    in a way that does not require complex and time-consuming data transformations.
    Without coding, data is available for users as tables in a single step. Empowered
    by the self-service data analytic capabilities of visual tools, users can potentially
    perform as many kinds of analyses as they need. 5.1. System architecture The proposed
    prototype is implemented on NodeJS using several libraries, such as Express,14
    for implementing our REST API, a modified version of NGSI-JS15 for handling NGSI-based
    connection with context broker, Turf16 for geolocation and json2csv17 for converting
    JSON in CSV. As far as we know, there is no library for NGSI-TSDB support; thus,
    we developed all the necessary code from scratch. In Fig. 6, one can observe a
    global perspective of the entire system architecture, from data collection through
    sensors, which publish data in the MQTT broker [14], to the RESTful API endpoint
    used by the analytic tool (e.g., the Power BI). This figure does not include other
    applications that also consume the same context data through NGSI-based interoperability
    with context broker and QuantumLeap, as well as a Hadoop system used for storing
    static data (i.e., old data collected from sensors), because these additional
    systems are not relevant to the proposed approach. Download : Download high-res

    This figure presents a generic scenario in which one or more brokers can be used.
    In our use case, we tested the prototype within an environment with four brokers,
    Orion, Orion LD, Scorpio and Stellio, each in a distinct tenant. In the case of
    Orion/Orion LD, a MongoDB database is used to store the entities that represent
    each Digital Twin in the real world in their last known state. The historical
    context data (collected by QuantumLeap by means of update subscriptions) is stored
    in the CrateDB database. On the other hand, the brokers that provide the temporal
    NGSI-LD API store both types of data, the current world state and historical data,
    in a single database: PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB, for Scorpio and Stellio, respectively.
    As one can observe in Fig. 6, the data bridge prototype mediates the interaction
    between the brokers and QuantumLeap on the left side and the analytic tool on
    the right. The context document (http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld), which contains
    the specification of the custom entities, is hosted in a web server depicted in
    Fig. 6. The required connection parameters, such as IP addresses, TCP ports, NGSI
    versions (of the brokers and QuantumLeap) and URLs of the context document, are
    defined in a configuration file presented in Fig. 11- System configuration file.
    In Section 5.4, we discuss these settings in some detail. 5.2. Interface for analytic
    tools The proposed system provides a uniform API for data bridging, enabling users
    to be unaware of the context broker they use. In Appendix A, the API and its parameters
    (Table A.1) for spatial-temporal querying and other options are presented. This
    API reuses and adapts parameters of NGSI-V2, NGSI-LD and NGSI-TSDB APIs in order
    to get a uniform interface and extends these with three additional parameters:
    format, extended and join. The format parameter allows the user to choose the
    output format as JSON or CSV. The extended parameter is Boolean; If set to true,
    additional columns containing the context broker''s metadata are added. By default,
    the objects are flattened as multiple columns, each per object''s attribute, to
    produce a table-oriented data structure. This data transformation is presented
    in the following example of a Building entity modelled according to the diagram
    in Fig. 7. The context broker provides the NGSI-LD structure presented in Fig.
    8 on the left side. Then, this data is consumed by the proposed system, which
    produces the entity''s columns at the output as the table-oriented data structure
    presented in Fig. 8 on the right for the possible data structures: normal and
    extended. Download : Download high-res image (205KB) Download : Download full-size

    full-size image Fig. 8. Data transformations. In the extended format, new columns
    for @context, the address_verified flag, location latitude and longitude are added.
    In the case of entity TemperatureSensor, the temperature attribute may get new
    ones, such as temperature_unitCode filled with the value “Celsius”; temperature_type
    filled with “Float” and temperature_observedAt. Additionally, inspired in the
    QuantumLeap, for the location still, there is an additional column containing
    the geographic location centroid. Finally, this output can be represented as JSON
    or CSV structures according to the format parameter and then consumed by the analytic
    tool. Regarding error responses, the error message payload is a JSON object, including
    an error code and optional description. Appendix A - Table A.2 depicts the types
    of HTTP responses and payloads. The CRUD operations for context data modification,
    data aggregation per attributes (e.g., sum, average), or types of queries other
    than temporal and geolocation make no sense in our system. Notice that the proposed
    system is a data bridge to enable the connection of end-user self-service data
    analytic tools to the IoT ecosystem. Nevertheless, query operations have a major
    relevance. In the next section, the querying features are discussed. Download

    full-size image Fig. 10. Temporal query using a join of two entities. 5.3. Querying
    The self-service analytics tools provide visual, easy and powerful features of
    data filtering, aggregation and many other analytic operations available to users.
    The proposed system should provide a simple query syntax in order to be used by
    non-technical users. Thus, the proposed system is focused on providing four levels
    of data selection for extracting the datasets: (1) service/tenant, (2) entity
    level, (3) temporal and (4) geographic. Additionally, it enables join operations
    between two entities when a one-to-many relationship exists. In general, IoT data
    is produced in real-time and is handled by subscriptions of changes in data entities,
    as mentioned in Section 3.1. This requires that the analytic tool can handle these
    subscriptions, such as the case of the cloud-based version of Power BI integrated
    into Azure, which provides a REST endpoint for receiving data updates [48]. To
    address this limitation in the desktop analytic tools (that usually do not provide
    such API), users can use the proposed temporal and geographic filters to split
    the data into smaller chunks based on geographic areas and/or time intervals of
    old (static) and new data to optimise the ETL process execution in the desktop
    tool, thus, enabling dashboards to be updated on demand. Table inner joins are
    particularly useful in data models like the one in Fig. 7. The TemperatureSensor
    entity contains the temperature in a building but does not contain the location
    and other data about the building where the temperature was measured. In order
    to address this use case, the parameter join (see Table A.1) lets the user include
    the attributes of the related table, providing a view of the two tables, as in
    the example presented in Fig. 9. In this example, is presented a tuple with the
    current state of an instance of TemperatureSensor joined with the controlled asset
    (building). The query predicate selects all instances of the TemperatureSensor
    entity in the service/tenant “test_ld”. Because the extended parameter is set
    to true, all building attributes are also presented. Using the attrs parameter,
    users can select fewer columns to reduce the width of the dataset. Using the entityId
    path parameter or the idPattern parameter, users can reduce the height of the
    dataset to a smaller number of rows. Fig. 10 presents another example in which
    the parameter fromDate selects all temperature values of the entity urn:ngsi-ld:TemperatureSensor:001
    from May 18th to the present moment. Due to space limitations, a single instance
    (table row) is presented, as well as some columns are omitted. As we can observe,
    three new columns provide the data and time (in two formats, _timeIndex and _dateTime)
    and the temperature measure at that time. If extended and join options are disabled,
    then the dataset just contains the first four columns: _timeIndex, _dateTime,
    entityId and temperature. We should notice that in the extended version (this
    example), two values of the temperature are presented per row: one regarding the
    sample (May 18th) and another in the current state (May 26th). Additionally, in
    the case of a broker that supports NGSI-LD temporal API (e.g., Sttelio), the instanceId
    field provides a reference to the record that contains the temperature at the
    observed time. As previously mentioned, this query API was developed with simplicity
    as a design principle. It should enable users to select their datasets on-demand,
    only applying geographic and temporal criteria, as well as it should provide means
    for differential updates. All other complex analyses, such as filtering and data
    aggregation by attributes, should be addressed in the scope of the visual analytic
    tools. 5.4. System definitions In the current version of the prototype, the security
    can be enabled and handled in the scope of a FIWARE service/tenant, requiring
    an access key per user. These issues, and others, are defined in a configuration
    file with the structure presented in Fig. 11. For development and test purposes,
    the security can be turned off. If enabled, each user must use a key that grants
    him a daily limit of requests to one or more FIWARE services/tenants. Download
    : Download high-res image (511KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11.
    System configuration file. Each FIWARE service/tenant requires connection parameters
    (e.g., IP and port) for a context broker (e.g., Orion LD or Scorpio) and optionally
    to QuantumLeap. In this example, four services/tenants are configured for each
    type of supported context broker. The first two context brokers share the same
    QuantumLeap in port 8668. Because Scorpio and Stellio support the temporal NGSI-LD
    API, the connection to QuantumLeap is unnecessary. All client accesses are logged
    into a log file according to the definition in these config settings. 5.5. Security
    – authentication and control access management Our approach, based on middleware,
    provides a uniform mechanism for authentication and control access management,
    enabling users to be unaware of each context broker they use. At present, these
    mechanisms are minimal to work as proof of concept. On the internal side, due
    to the distinct security mechanisms of each context broker, distinct approaches
    are required. In the current implementation, our prototype is based on a trust
    relationship with each context broker. 6. Evaluation and results discussion The
    proposed system aims to provide a simple interface for connecting data analytic
    tools to NGSI-based IoT ecosystems. We argue that enterprise solutions in smart
    domains, such as Smart Agriculture and Industry, could potentially benefit from
    the proposed system, enabling non-technical business users to consume on-demand
    IoT data and use it in their daily tasks. Thus, in order to evaluate the proposed
    system, we simulated these enterprise scenarios in an educational use case. Using
    the brokers Orion, Orion LD, Scorpio and Stellio, and QuantumLeap, we implemented
    a real FIWARE ecosystem depicted in Fig. 6. The air quality sensors collect data
    from the Open Weather Map18 public platform. The system has been working using
    the Orion LD and QuantumLeap since January of 2023, collecting data from 26 geographical
    points in the city of Maia in Portugal. The physical measurements collected were
    the temperature, humidity and wind speed. Regarding computational resources, the
    system was implemented using four docker-based network environments running on
    a shared Linux virtual server with four cores and 16GB of RAM. The first two groups
    of dockers support the Orion and Orion LD. Each has a QuantumLeap, a CrateDB,
    a MongoDB, an IoT Agent, a Mosquitto and a web server in the Orion LD''s docker;
    the third group of dockers for Scorpio, PostgreSQL and Apache Kafka and a web
    server and the last for Stellio, TimescaleDB and Apache Kafka and another web
    server. Outside the dockers, in the main host, our prototype and the context data
    providers (i.e., the sensors) were installed. This environment was used to test
    the prototype and conduct its evaluation. The experiment discussed next was conducted
    using the data collected from January of 2023 until now using the first docker-based
    network based on Orion LD and QuantumLeap. 6.1. Experiments and results Although
    this experiment is based on an educational use case involving a class of business
    sciences master''s students (with non-technical backgrounds), the goal was to
    simulate a real scenario involving users without non-technical skills who were
    asked to consume IoT data and implement analytical processes using it. The experiment
    started by presenting the prototype''s API and the available time series of temperature,
    humidity and wind speed in the geographic points to a group of 14 students. Each
    student was then asked to implement the following five Power BI dashboards applying
    temporal and geographic criteria over the data of those three physical measurements:
    (1) the number of daily collected samples; (2) the average temperature in several
    points of a map (depicted in Fig. 13); (3) the daily temperature variations (i.e.,
    the temperature variation from the previous day – depicted in Fig. 14); (4) line
    graphic visualisation of the three time-series, one per each physical measurement
    and (5) the average, maximum and minimum physical measurement per each hour of
    the day as a bar graph. At the end of the experiment, all students successfully
    imported the IoT data to the Power BI. Their difficulties only occurred during
    the design phase of the dashboards. We should note that all students already have
    basic knowledge of ETL processes involving MS Excel, CSV and (simple) JSON files.
    Thus, there was only a slight learning curve regarding the API and their parameters.
    As one can observe in Fig. 12, a few ETL steps were required in the case of Power
    Query Editor, even in the JSON format option. Indeed, most of them were generated
    automatically in a few seconds. As discussed in Section 3.2, this step would be
    much more complex or impossible to achieve without the proposed system. Alternatively,
    one may consider the hypothesis of connecting the analytical tool to the backend
    database (in this scenario: CrateDB, PostgreSQL or TimesaleDB). Although this
    is a simple step, there are two major problems: (1) In general, in real production
    scenarios, these backend databases have very restrictive security policies, posing
    problems in terms of control and access management for the IT support teams; (2)
    additionally, such an approach could be more time consuming for users, due to
    the specificities of the data model of the broker. For instance, the QuantumLeap
    stores data in the CrateDB as one table per entity. However, in the case of Scorpio
    and Stellio, the data model in the database is much more complex, in which an
    entity is supported on multiple tables containing its attributes as JSON-based
    columns. Thus, in order to explore this alternative approach, we asked the 14
    participants in the study to extract data directly from the backend systems CrateDB,
    used by Quantumleap and PostgreSQL, used by Stellio. All the participants required
    technical support to establish the connection to these tested databases, contrasting
    with instantaneous connection using the proposed system. Using the web interface
    provided by the CrateDB, all participants successfully manually imported data
    to Power BI. However, in the case of PostgreSQL, none of them was able to finish
    the task. They justified their difficulties with the complexity of the data structures
    based on several tables and columns in the JSON format. Download : Download high-res

    daily variations. These results allow us to claim that the proposed system can
    accelerate the implementation of ETL processes, which is particularly useful when
    using self-service visual analytical tools because end-users have a simple interface
    that maps an IoT entity in a single table; thus, all complexity regarding the
    data model is handled in the context of the visual analytic tool. Additionally,
    the proposed approach still helps end-users overcome the necessary access restrictions
    imposed by the security policies of the IoT ecosystem. As a result, end-users
    can do their tasks, minimising the technical support given by the IT teams. A
    second experiment involved the PySpark, a Python API for Apache Spark. This API
    enables users to perform real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed
    environment using Python. It also provides a PySpark shell for interactive data
    analysis. Applying the CSV format prototype''s option, the few lines of code presented
    in Fig. 15 were enough to download the IoT data, load it into a DataFrame19 and
    then print the average temperature per geographic place to the screen. Download

    A PySpark-based example for obtaining the average of the temperature per the streetAddress
    field. In this second experience, we reached the same conclusions that we had
    obtained in the previous one using Power BI. The end-users can be more productive
    and agile, less dependent on the IT support teams, focusing their effort on the
    analytics process in the scope of a visual analytic tool or programming environment,
    such as Python. 6.2. Discussion of the results In the previous section, we demonstrated
    that the proposed system enables end-users to extract IoT data from NGSI-based
    ecosystems. Based on these experimental results, we now justify how the objectives
    defined in Section 4.2 were achieved. (1) A fast learning curve for using the
    proposed system – The population that participated in the experiment does not
    have technical skills in the areas of IT or IoT. Despite this, their knowledge
    of the tools used (Power BI and PySpark) was sufficient to be able to connect
    to the NGSI-based ecosystem and extract data. We should notice that this task
    just takes a few moments (see Fig. 12). This contrasts with related work, in which
    end users must use different technical methods for data extraction, depending
    on the FIWARE component; (2) Simple mapping between IoT entities and extracted
    data – The proposed system maps an IoT entity in a single table as in the relational
    model. Optionally, enables inner join operations on two related entities. Furthermore,
    the proposed approach allows users to be oblivious to the underlying FIWARE component
    and its NGSI dialect. Thus, end-users only manipulate data tables following the
    relational model. We consider this approach as simple as possible; (3) Standard
    interface enabling the support for self-service visual analytics tool - The system
    provides two possible output formats, JSON and CSV. These formats are well known
    and used in all leading tools, such as Power BI, Tableau and Qlik, as well as
    in Python-based environments; (4) Overcome the control access limitations of backend
    systems usually imposed by security policies – As discussed in Section 5.1, the
    proposed architecture mediates the interaction between the NGSI-based ecosystem
    and the tools used by end-users. This approach only exposes a REST API to the
    outside world, avoiding access to those backend systems, as well as the context
    brokers. The proposed system provides an authentication mechanism and access control
    per FIWARE tenant (see Section 5.5). We should highlight that there are also other
    benefits in terms of productivity. As discussed above, a simple task in a few
    seconds is required to extract data about an IoT entity. This is not the case
    with related works, in which end-users are dependent on IT and IoT experts, have
    to deal with complex database connection methods and have to apply data transformations
    on extracted data, thus compromising their work productivity. In the next section,
    the limitations of the proposed system and future work are discussed. 6.3. Limitations
    and future work The current version of the prototype does not implement any mechanism
    of caching, as well as little concern for code optimisation was taken into account.
    Thus, the real performance evaluation is out of the scope of the present work.
    Despite that, we performed some tests using datasets with 500.000 records (of
    those three physical measurements), which we consider a small volume of data compared
    with a real big data scenario. For this size of the dataset, in the presented
    docker-based environment, the execution average time of a query was 4.57 s. This
    is an average value that was calculated using the metrics provided by the system
    after ten consecutive queries. We consider this average time as satisfactory in
    terms of user experience during our system evaluation. However, using a larger
    number of records could be a significant performance issue. Regarding security
    and access control, the applied security model was shown to be effective. The
    proposed system enabled users to consume IoT data of four distinct tenants in
    four distinct systems and versions of NGSI: Orion/ QuantumLeap, Orion LD/QuantumLeap,
    Scorpio and Stellio. We should notice that by using our system, the IoT ecosystem
    can be locked from the outside world. Only the endpoint discussed in Section 5.2
    is available from the corporative network or the Internet. However, other scenarios
    involving public and corporate communities, as well as monetised approaches, will
    require more sophisticated security models. In the present security model, the
    data granularity access control is defined at the tenant level, thus granting
    access to all entities in a tenant. A more granular access control at the entity
    level is required. Each user should have access only to a set of entities of one
    or more tenants. Finally, regarding the querying features, the prototype enabled
    the implementation of ETL processes based on extracted data by imposed temporal
    and geolocation criteria. The proposed system also enables the join operation
    at the data extraction moment, enabling data of two entities to be ingested as
    a single table. These table join operations can be done in the scope of the self-service
    analytic tool using separated datasets (one per entity); nevertheless, this option
    can be particularly useful in the case of NGSI-LD data, in which entities may
    contain relationships with others. Despite these satisfactory results, additional
    criteria parameters could be needed in other complex use cases. Thus, in terms
    of limitations, three types of issues should be the subject of research and improvements
    in future versions of the prototype: (1) performance, (2) security and access
    control management, and (3) new querying options. 7. Conclusions In NGSI-based
    ecosystems, IoT data can be consumed by self-service visual analytic tools following
    two approaches. In the first, using FIWARE components (discussed in Section 3)
    to store data in backend databases. However, for the end-users, this approach
    poses problems of security and dependence on IT support. The second one is based
    on queries to the context brokers. These systems have available NGSI-based APIs,
    which provide means to query data according to spatial and temporal criteria,
    enabling the users to get the temperature, humidity or any other type of value
    measured by a sensor, serving their purposes when using analytic tools. However,
    these APIs have complex data structures that invalidate direct connection to those
    tools due to object-relational impedance mismatch between JSON structures provided
    by these APIs and the table-oriented structures, which, in general, are consumed
    by data analytics tools. We presented a prototype of a lightweight data bridge
    for self-service data analytic tools, such as Power BI, Tableau, Qlik and RapidMiner,
    programming environments, such as PySpark or any other type of tool that consumes
    table-oriented data in JSON or CSV formats, enabling them to connect directly
    to NGSI-V2/NGSI-LD/NGSI-TSDB based systems in order to consume real-time produced
    data, as well as historical data in form of time series. The proposed system addresses
    those problems by exposing a simple and uniform API for context brokers (based
    on NGSI-V2 and NGSI-LD) and QuantumLeap (based on NGSI-TSDB), supporting their
    spatial and temporal query capabilities. Additionally, transforms data to a table-oriented
    structure and adds new query options. Finally, provides authentication and access
    control mechanisms. In the current version of the prototype, a user authenticates
    using a unique key, which grants him access to all entities of a service/tenant;
    for future versions, the entity type granularity control access is planned. In
    order to evaluate our proposal, a FIWARE ecosystem was mounted and used in experiments
    conducted by a class of business sciences master''s students who implemented Power
    BI dashboards and programs in PySpark. This experiment demonstrated that end-users
    could easily consume data from an IoT ecosystem on-demand and autonomously without
    requiring the support of specialised IT teams, contrasting with related works
    in terms of work productivity and agility. This is an important feature in several
    use cases, such as smart industrial or agricultural. The proposed system is being
    implemented in a real use case of a public service organisation for managing air
    quality data. The presented system is still a prototype developed without major
    concerns about performance and security. Thus, in terms of limitations, three
    types of issues will be subject to improvements in future versions of the prototype:
    (1) performance, (2) security and access control, and (3) new querying options.

    and content Abstract In fog-based IoT systems, every fog can behave differently
    due to context and vulnerabilities. In smart irrigation systems, some fog nodes
    use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor
    location, soil moisture, plant species, or seasons. Therefore, fog behavior should
    consider distinct contexts. Federated learning support fog-based IoT systems to
    detect faster the behavior of fog nodes as it enables them to perceive previous
    behaviors from their peer nodes. We develop and assess an unsupervised federated
    learning system to identify fog anomalies. We consider experiments with seven
    rounds of four minutes, executing K-Means in every node to obtain local centroids,
    and the system merges them in the cloud to calculate global centroids, sending
    them back to the fog nodes. This paper evaluates the accuracy and time a fog node
    needs to predict a behavior already identified by another fog node. We assess
    the CPU usage and the time the cloud takes to compute global centroids using thousands
    of local cluster centers and measure the prediction time for different fog hardware.
    We observe that the cloud CPU usage and time to obtain the global centroids vary
    according to the number of fog nodes and the number of fog behaviors. Our results
    also show that, in the worst case, our system predicts a behavior by around 50
    ms. In contrast, a non-federated approach must wait for the current round to end,

    learning 1. Introduction Fog computing can reduce the volume of data transferred
    to the cloud and decrease the IoT system response time [1,2] as it is physically
    located near the end devices, like sensors and actuators [3]. Besides these advantages,
    fog nodes are vulnerable to attacks and anomalous behaviors [4], which is not
    feasible to monitor manually [5], due to their massive numbers and distinct performance
    behaviors during execution. Cook et al. [6] ratify that detecting anomalies using
    supervised learning algorithms may cause adversities because the system cannot
    perceive new unknown behaviors on the fly. The heterogeneity of fog nodes considers
    the diversity of hardware resources, security policies, data analysis duration,
    and demands CPU and RAM usage [28]. Therefore, each fog node may have different
    expected performance behaviors. Let us consider, for example, two fog nodes with
    the same hardware configurations, where the expected behavior of the first one
    is receiving 200 packets per minute and 60 % CPU usage, but the second one expects
    1000 packets per minute and 20 % CPU usage. Therefore, each fog node can have
    distinct and unlabeled anomalous behaviors, which makes it appropriate to use
    unsupervised learning [14] to detect new behaviors. Knowing every fog behavior
    is essential because the expected behavior can vary according to context features.
    For example, in a smart hospital, a fog node can demand more or less hardware
    and network resources to store and analyze data because the data analysis frequency
    and duration depend on attributes like the number of patients, seasonality, and
    specific sickness endemic peaks. The same happens in a smart irrigation system,
    where some fog nodes use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data
    according to sensor location, soil moisture, plant species, or annual seasons.
    This paper proposes the FL-Means system that uses unsupervised federated learning
    [7] to streamline the detection of fog node performance behavior (where one behavior
    is a single data cluster). FL-Means addresses the fog node''s veracity challenge
    (detection of expected and unexpected performance behaviors), preliminarily introduced
    by the TW-IoT framework [9]. However, TW-IoT focuses on general concepts without
    proposing or evaluating fog behavior veracity. Here, we consider that the same
    IoT system can have many fog nodes demanding different levels of computing resources
    (behaving differently). Our system can detect every fog node''s expected and anomalous
    performance behaviors, regardless of context variations. Also, it perceives these
    behaviors faster because it uses federated learning. Our system executes an unsupervised
    learning K-Means algorithm [8,31] in every fog node to recognize its performance
    behaviors individually. It also transmits these behaviors as local cluster centroids
    to the cloud side, and the cloud calculates global centroids, sending them to
    all fog nodes. Therefore, all fog nodes use global centroids to identify behaviors
    that occurred previously in other fog nodes and can make accurate predictions.
    Our system also preserves data privacy among fog nodes and the cloud because it
    only transmits data centroids [10], improving the IoT data trustworthiness [9].
    We assess FL-Means in three scenarios, using simulated sensors: (1) agility: evaluate
    FL-Means against a non-federated baseline approach, simulating several behaviors
    in two fog nodes, (2) scalability: explore the system scalability by varying the
    number of fog nodes sending local centroids to the cloud, and (3) heterogeneity:
    analyze the heterogeneity using different fog node hardware to verify the sample
    prediction time, the time to compute local centroids, and the time to receive
    the global centroids. In Scenario 1, we observe two situations where FL-Means
    predicts the fog node behaviors from 1710 to 8043 times faster than the baseline
    approach. Our approach also shows that FL-Means presents higher prediction accuracy
    for these cases but has similar accuracy to the baseline for other situations.
    In Scenario 2, we perceive that the number of behaviors and fog nodes affects
    the CPU usage and time to compute global centroids. When we test 100 local centroids
    for 12 cluster centers, the cloud calculates the global centroids in 1.02 ± 0.01
    s, and for 1000 fog nodes, this computation took less than seven seconds. Finally,
    in Scenario 3, we observe that even in the worst case, using Jetson Nano CPU computation,
    the fog node obtains the local centroids in 2.46 ± 0.02 s, it receives the global
    centroids in 3.18 ± 0.15 s (considering 100 fog nodes), and executes sample predictions
    in 46.77 ± 0.41 ms. We also have evidence that the FL-Means system may support
    the cloud in monitoring all fog node behaviors because the cloud receives the
    behaviors'' centroids from every fog node, decreasing IoT management costs. This
    paper unfolds the sections as follows: Section 2 details the background, Section
    3 covers the related work, Section 4 explains our unsupervised federated learning
    system, Section 5 reports the used methodology, Section 6 reveals our results,
    Section 7 presents the discussion, and finally Section 8 presents the conclusions
    and future work. 2. Background This section clarifies concepts about IoT Stages,
    clustering (unsupervised learning), and federated learning. 2.1. IoT stages This
    paper considers a fog-based IoT system unfolding four computing stages, three
    (thing, mist, and fog) at the edge and a fourth stage at the cloud side. The thing
    stage [11] perceives a context by sensors and executes the system''s decisions
    using actuators. The mist stage [12] can pre-process data before transmitting
    it to the fog stage [3], which can perform system decisions, and may reduce network
    traffic between the edge and the cloud. The cloud stage [13] has more computing
    power than fog and can analyze historical data to improve and make robust decisions.
    2.2. Clustering Unsupervised machine learning, also known as clustering, can cluster
    data samples without prior knowledge of any data category [14,35]. Clustering
    algorithms identify similarities between data samples to generate clusters through
    different strategies, like data density or distance between samples. Consequently,
    these algorithms use the data to create a data model that represents the found
    clusters. Some clustering algorithms only group data samples but do not predict
    which group a new data sample belongs. The algorithms K-Means, Mean-Shift, and
    BIRCH do not have this prediction limitation, also, it is well-known that K-Means
    compute predictions faster than Mean-Shift and BIRCH [14,31,36]. K-Means also
    is faster than other algorithms, according to the results in [36], which evaluated
    data reduction based on machine learning algorithms for fog computing in agriculture.
    The K-Means algorithm begins by randomly defining values for K clusters centroids.
    After that, K-Means iteratively calculates the arithmetic mean distance between
    the centroid and the cluster data points, assigning the computed mean values to
    each K centroid until the data points stay in the same cluster. The Mean-Shift
    algorithm uses the density-based clustering strategy to iteratively search the
    centroids of regions with the highest data points density. Then, Mean-Shift assigns
    these regions as the final clusters. BIRCH is a hierarchical algorithm that builds
    a data tree with leaves corresponding to subclusters and has a threshold value
    that limits each subcluster radius. BIRCH also groups subclusters at the ending
    of execution to obtain a K number of clusters. For K-Means, we mandatory need
    to determine the number of K clusters to generate a data model. However, it is
    impossible to speculate the number of K that obtains the best model. Therefore,
    we can evaluate it by calculating a validation index like Calinski–Harabasz [15].
    The Calinski–Harabasz index can decide the optimal number of clusters, revealing
    the best clustering when the index reaches the highest possible value. 2.3. Federated
    learning Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
    enables a computing system to train models from decentralized data sources [7].
    In other words, the federated learning approach supports an IoT system to collaboratively
    join different information from distinct edge nodes, enhancing the system''s decisions.
    In IoT, for example, the cloud can create a global model by aggregating individual
    local models of edge nodes. Imteaj et al. [16] and Hosseinalipour et al. [17]
    describe an FL approach in which the edge nodes collect data, generate a local
    model, and send the local gradients to the cloud. When the cloud receives these
    gradients, it runs a federated averaging algorithm to create a global model and
    transmit the global model gradient to edge nodes [7,10]. In IoT, using federated
    learning can also preserve local data privacy because it does not require exposing
    raw data records through the network [10]. 3. Related work Cook et al. [6] expose
    the challenge of detecting anomalies in IoT systems, considering contextual information,
    prior knowledge, scalability, and resource constraints. They also suggest that
    using a classifier for anomaly detection may pose difficulties in perceiving unexplored
    anomalies. Li et al. [18] present a literature review for federated learning,
    and they mention that “existing FL frameworks construct based on supervised learning
    method.” Moreover, they mention federated training for unsupervised machine learning
    as a new research frontier. Sater and Hamza [19] present a federated learning
    approach called FSLSTM to detect sensor energy consumption anomalies in smart
    buildings. They tested the FSLSTM against deep learning models with three types
    of sensors and observed that their proposal presented higher accuracy for detecting
    these anomalies. Yadav et al. [20] propose a federated unsupervised deep learning
    approach. Their approach uses autoencoders to learn unlabeled data and generate
    its own feature set. They evaluate their proposal using a dataset named CICIDS
    without the data labels, obtaining an accuracy of 97.75 % after 100 training rounds.
    Servetnyk, Fung, and Han [21] present an unsupervised federated learning approach
    for unbalanced data that combines the weight computation strategy with an algorithm
    like K-Means. They artificially generate a dataset with 16 clusters and 50 data
    points per cluster. In experiments, they observed that their proposal clustered
    the data better than centralized K-Means, and their results only focused on measuring
    clustering performance metrics. Ahmad et al. [32] proposed a streaming anomaly
    detection algorithm named HTM and evaluated their approach against other techniques
    using a benchmark called NAB. In the evaluation, they mainly measured latency
    and the NAB score. The study considered sensor temporal noise anomalies but did
    not concern a fog-based scenario. Sivanathan et al. [33] categorized the behavior
    of different IoT devices and developed an unsupervised clustering method to identify
    each device''s normal network traffic behavior. The authors also considered retraining
    models for detecting behavior changes due to a firmware upgrade of devices and
    obtained 94.7 % accuracy. Kumar, Karthik, and Nair [22] present a federated K-Means
    clustering that uses K-Means models as local models and calculates the cluster''s
    centroids average in the cloud. The authors assessed their proposal using well-known
    MNIST and EMNIST datasets. However, the study only focused on measuring the model''s
    accuracy. They also do not consider the continuous changeability of the optimal
    number of clusters for every single edge node. Examining the related work, the
    authors do not consider an IoT scenario containing thousands of fog nodes with
    distinct expected behaviors that can individually change according to the seasonality
    (such as the period of the day, month, or season of the year). Therefore, the
    main contribution of this paper is to present a system that can iteratively identify
    new behaviors of fog nodes using a clustering approach to predict the expected
    behavior of individual nodes, also considering the temporal features for distinct
    contexts, like in a smart irrigation system, where some fog nodes use more or
    fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor location, soil
    moisture, plant species, or annual seasons, for example. Our system can also select
    the best model and identify all the fog node behaviors, which may favor diagnosing
    future faults of each node behavior. 4. FL-means system In this paper, we propose
    a system named FL-Means [34] that uses unsupervised federated learning to discover
    new unlabeled fog node behaviors during system execution, also enabling a fog
    node to identify the other fog nodes’ behaviors. FL-Means has a component executing
    on fog nodes and another on the cloud side, respectively named Fog-FL and Cloud-FL
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Fog-FL and Cloud-FL only transmit clusters centroids
    between fog nodes and the cloud side. In other words, these components do not
    transfer raw data; thus, our system enhances data privacy because it does not
    expose any collected information. Download : Download high-res image (375KB) Download

    cloud-FL component. Fog-FL collects a dataset named workingDB (Figs. 1 and 2),
    which has data samples such as CPU and RAM usage (%), packet delay among sensors
    and fog node (in milliseconds), throughput (Kbps), and the number of packets arriving
    in fog node by every T seconds. Before loop1 execution (Fig. 1), we feed the WorkingDB
    with a few data samples to obtain the known behaviors. During loop1 running, the
    Fog-FL continues to collect these data samples, inserting them in another dataset
    named samplesDB. On the fog side (Fig. 1), the FL-Means system executes five steps
    iteratively: (i) it uses WorkingDB as input to train different K-Means data models
    by varying K values, and it utilizes the Calinski–Harabasz index to decide the
    best model to select (ii) it extracts the clusters centroids of the selected model
    and sends it to the cloud, (iii) it receives new global centroids from the cloud,
    (iv) predicts each sample behavior (cluster) calculating the Euclidean distance
    of these samples from the global centroids and decide if the sample behavior is
    anomalous or not (we consider the expected behavior as the cluster that has more
    data points occurrences in workingDB), and (v) it updates workingDB by inserting
    the data samples of samplesDB in workingDB, because, during Fog-FL execution,
    samplesDB may have new behaviors that are not already stored in workingDB. Additionally,
    the FL-Means system normalizes every input data sample before generating a model
    or predicting its clusters. The Fig. 2 example details the steps presented in
    Fig. 1 and the interaction between the model generated from workingDB and the
    samplesDB. In the Fig. 2 example, the system contains a model from workingDB with
    two known behaviors (A0 and A1). Initially, the system generates a local model
    from workingDB and receives the global model from the cloud. During loop2 execution
    (step 4), it predicts every sample (line) of samplesDB as A0 or A1 behavior. After
    round 1 (all steps''s first execution), the system creates a new workingDB (by
    joining it with samplesDB). In rounds 2 and 3, the system uses the new workingDB
    formed after rounds and repeats the steps mentioned in Fig. 1. However, after
    round 3, the new workingDB model learns a new behavior A2, and now the system
    can detect it when it occurs in any fog node. Therefore, the system joins the
    initial workingDB with the subsequents samplesDB because it can generate models
    from data that appeared during execution time. The system receives each fog''s
    local centroids on the cloud side (Fig. 3). It computes the Euclidean distance
    between every local centroid to verify if it is lower than a threshold value and,
    in turn, marks the centroids that obey this condition. After that, the cloud merges
    the marked centroids by calculating these centroids’ arithmetic mean, and then
    we obtain new centroids values, which refer to combining similar fog node clusters
    centroids. Then, FL-Mean obtains the global centroids being: all the centroids
    of the fog node clusters that Cloud-FL did not merge and the merged fog node centroids.
    Finally, it sends global centroids to all fog nodes. In Fig. 3, the word pass
    means that there is no action for the algorithm execute. 5. Methodology We explore
    three Scenarios: (1) FL-Means against a baseline approach (without global centroids),
    (2) system scalability with thousand local centroids, and (3) FL-Means heterogeneity,
    using different fog node hardware configurations. In the experiments, we use CrateDB
    [23] to support workingDB and samplesDB and run the SenSE simulator [24] to generate
    a dataflow of thousands of packets (which contains the timestamp of the packet
    creation time). We also employ a naïve Linux stress-ng tool to overload the fog
    node CPU and RAM. For Fog-FL (Fig. 1), we configure T = 5 s and i = 48, and for
    Cloud-FL (Fig. 3), we set the threshold value = 0.2. In the experiments, we also
    use the dataset collected by Fog-FL in reference [25]. In the experimental environment
    (Fig. 4), we include the four IoT stages (Section 2.1): SenSE represents the thing
    and mist stages, while Fog-FL and Cloud-FL play the role of the fog and cloud
    stages, respectively. For every scenario, we assess all the distinct time metrics
    with 30 replications, from which we calculate the arithmetic mean, the standard
    deviation, and the 95 % asymptotic confidence intervals. Download : Download high-res
    image (270KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Experimental environment
    (for scenario 3, the fog runs SQLite3 [27] instead of CrateDB). Our simulated
    environment data flow (Fig. 4) is based on the real scenario developed for the
    SWAMP project [29,30], which developed an IoT smart water management system focused
    in high-precision smart irrigation. The project had four pilots: (i) MATOPIBA
    Pilot, in Luís Eduardo Magalhães - Brazil, (ii) Guaspari Pilot, in Espírito Santo
    do Pinhal - Brazil, (iii) Intercrop Pilot, Cartagena - Spain, and (iv) CBEC Pilot,
    San Michele/Fosdondo - Italy. In our experiment, we use time-driven sensors because
    we considered the environment for smart irrigation, as shown in [11]. Zyrianoff
    et al. [11] presented and evaluated a 5-layer IoT architecture with different
    configurations for smart agriculture and smart cities applications. In the investigation,
    the authors explained that real smart cities applications can use more event-driven
    sensors, in contrast to real smart agriculture applications that focus on time-driven
    sensors. 5.1. Scenario 1: accuracy and prediction time We use the Mosquitto MQTT
    Broker [26] to intercommunicate all IoT stages, and every stage runs on the Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. In Scenario 1, we compare our FL-Means system against a baseline
    approach, which is a system that only relies on the fog side. Therefore, the baseline
    does not include steps 2 and 3, mentioned in Fig. 1, without any federation learning
    technique. It also predicts samples (see step 4 of Fig. 1) using the naïve prediction
    method of the K-Means algorithm. 5.1.1. Performance behaviors for fog A We first
    simulate behavior A0 for 10 min and A1 for 20 min, and in subsequent rounds, execute
    behaviors A2 and A3 [25]. • A0: Null packet load (no network traffic). • A1: 1000
    packets per minute and CPU load by 70 %. • A2: 1500 packets per minute, CPU load
    by 100 %, and RAM by 50 %. • A3: 200 packets per minute and CPU load by 40 %.
    5.1.2. Performance behaviors for fog B We initially run behavior B0 for 10 min,
    B1 for 20 min, and B2 for 10 min. In subsequent rounds, execute behaviors B3,
    B4, and B5 [25]. • B0: similar to behavior A0. • B1: 500 packets per minute. •
    B2: 500 packets per minute and CPU load by 80 %. • B3: similar to behavior A1.
    • B4: similar to behavior A2. • B5: similar to behavior A3. 5.1.3. Timeline of
    behavior simulation We execute the experiments in 7 rounds (4 min each), using
    two fog nodes, Fog A and Fog B. As mentioned in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, before
    starting the experiments, the workingDB of Fog A has data records of behaviors
    A0 and A1, and the workingDB of Fog B has samples of behaviors B0, B1, and B2.
    Fig. 5 shows the occurrence of behaviors during the seven rounds and highlights
    the behaviors B3, B4, and B5 with a red outline when they appear for the first
    time in Fog B. Note that we run B3, B4, and B5 in Fog B after executing them in
    Fog A (as A1, A2, and A3). Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download

    2: scalability We explore Cloud-FL scalability considering Fog A and Fog B with
    the local centroids of rounds 1 and 7 (see Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and Fig. 4).
    We also evaluate both fog nodes with 12 local centroids. Our experiments simulate
    fog nodes sending 2, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000
    local centroids to the cloud (half Fog A and half Fog B). The cloud runs on Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations: • Conf.1: Fog A uses two local
    centroids from round 1 (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3), and Fog B uses three centroids
    from round 7 (Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3). • Conf.2: Fog A uses five local centroids,
    and Fog B uses six centroids from round 7. • Conf.3: Fog A uses 12 distinct clusters,
    and Fog B uses the same 12 centroids. 5.3. Scenario 3: heterogeneity We explore
    the FL-Means heterogeneity executing the Fog-FL component using different hardware
    devices. We assess Fog-FL in a Raspberry Pi 4, a Jetson Nano developer kit, and
    a personal computer (PC) with an Intel Core i7 processor. The cloud runs on the
    Linux Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4
    GHz and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations for the fog node hardware:
    • Raspberry: Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B running Linux 20.04 operating system
    with Quad-core ARM A72, 1.5 GHz, and 4GB memory. • Jetson: Jetson Nano Developer
    Kit running Linux 20.04 operating system with a Quad-core ARM A57, 1.43 GHz, and
    4 GB memory. • PC: A physical personal computer using an Intel Core i7-5500U processor
    with 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, and running Linux 20.04 operating system. 5.4. Metrics
    In scenario 1, we analyze the following metrics: (i) the Calinski–Harabasz index
    for every round; (ii) the number of clusters (it suggests the number of groups
    that fit better according to the Calinski–Harabasz validation index); (iii) the
    confusion matrix (assesses the K-Means data model accuracy); (iv) Accuracy of
    predictions (we evaluate the FL-Means system against baseline); (v) Euclidean
    distance between centroids of Fog A and B behaviors to identify which behaviors
    are similar; (vi) Time BDF, as the time that a fog node needs to correctly predict
    behaviors already learned by other fog nodes (FL-Means against baseline); (vii)
    Time to predict a known behavior in a single sample, where we assess FL-Means
    against a baseline. In scenario 2, we analyze the following metrics: (i) time
    to compute the global centroids and (ii) CPU usage of the Cloud-FL component.
    In scenario 3, we evaluate the (i) Time-Local as the time to compute the local
    centroids, (ii) Time-Global as the time to compute local centers and receive the
    global centroids, considering that a fog node is the first of 100 fog nodes to
    send the local centroids and the last to receive, (iii) Time-Pred-Fog as the time
    to K-Means sample prediction in a fog node (without federated learning) and (iv)
    Time-Pred-FL as the time of sample prediction using the global centroids. 6. Results
    In this section, we reveal our experiment results. 6.1. Results of scenario 1
    Scenario 1 presents the results for individual fog nodes (A and B), and we report
    the results for the FL-Means system against the baseline approach (see Section
    5.1). 6.1.1. Results for each fog node individual behaviors Before each round,
    the Fog-FL component (Fig. 1) runs the Calinski–Harabasz validation to select
    the best clustering model, varying the number of clusters by two up to 10, where
    we obtained the results shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. After Fog-FL decides the number
    of clusters, we observe that it corresponds to the number of simulated behaviors
    for Fog A and B (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5), except for rounds 6 and 7 of
    Fog A. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download : Download full-size

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A 2 2 2 3 3 5 5 B 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 In Table 1, we verify that the system
    finds the exact number of simulated behaviors for all rounds of Fog B. For rounds
    6 and 7 of Fog A, the Calinski–Harabasz validation suggests four clusters (Section
    5.1.1) but also identifies one more behavior (A4). After analyzing the A4 data
    points, we perceive that the system correctly identifies this new behavior because
    the delay of its samples is twice the value of behavior A1 records. Therefore,
    considering 5 clusters for the models in the last two rounds of Fog A is valid.
    Then, in these rounds, Fog A correctly perceives behaviors A0, A1, A2, A3, and
    A4. We generate a confusion matrix for the last selected models of Fog A and Fog
    B (Fig. 8). The confusion matrix presents the main diagonal tending to approximately
    98 % accuracy for Fog A and 100 % accuracy for Fog B (on a scale of 0.0–1.0),
    where rows and columns symbolize the simulated behaviors and the found clusters.
    Therefore, we perceive that the models are appropriate when comparing the clusters
    with the simulated behaviors (including found behavior A4). Download : Download

    the baseline We observe that during single sample predictions in Fog A (Fig. 9),
    the FL-Means system and the baseline approach present an accuracy lower than 80
    % for round 3 and equal to 0 % for round 5. The system generates these results
    because it does not immediately recognize the new behaviors A2 during round 3
    and A3 during round 5 (see timeline in Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image

    fog A. We can observe that behavior A3 never happened before round 5, for Fog
    A or Fog B (see Fig. 5). Therefore, the both systems (federated and non-federated)
    cannot perceive A3 until round 5 finishes, when will be generated a model created
    by a new workingDB with characteristics of behavior A3 (as mentioned in explanation
    of Fig. 2). In Fog A, the correct prediction of these new behaviors will only
    happen when the next round starts; in other words when Fog A generates a new k-means
    model that includes these behaviors as new clusters (see Table 1). During round
    3, for example, Fog A only knows the behaviors A0 and A1 (and behaviors B0, B1,
    B2, and B3 of Fog B if using the FL-Means system). However, no fog node has identified
    A2 yet (see Fig. 5), and it needs to wait until the next round to recognize this
    behavior because A2 is unprecedented for the entire system. In round 5, for example,
    the accuracy is 0 % (Fig. 9) because A3 is the only simulated in this round (see
    Fig. 5). However, the system can identify this behavior in the subsequent round
    6 because, after round 5, Fog A generates new models containing the most recent
    samples and identifies new clusters. In rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7, we observe an accuracy
    of 100 % for both approaches. In round 4, the FL-Means system presented an accuracy
    of 93.8 % against 100 % for baseline. In Fog B, we observe that the baseline does
    not correctly predict the behaviors B4 during round 4 and B5 during round 6 but
    that the FL-Means system detects these behaviors correctly and reveals the most
    accurate prediction values for all assessed rounds (Fig. 10). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system is most advantageous than the baseline because, in rounds 4 and 6, it detects
    the behaviors B4 (identical to A2) and B5 (like A3) without the Fog B needing
    to wait for the next round (to generate a new data model). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system identified B4 and B5 correctly in Fog B because the system previously learned
    them as Fog A behaviors (see timeline in Fig. 5 and Table 1). Download : Download

    predictions for fog B. During round 4, the Fog B individually only knows 4 clusters:
    B0, B1, B2, and B3 (see Table 1), but using the FL-Means system, it also knows
    that the behavior B4 is similar to A2 because Fog A model already knows the three
    clusters: A0, A1, and A2 (see Table 1 and Fig. 5). Analyzing Table 2, we also
    observe that the FL-Means system merged the behaviors B4 and A2 because the Euclidean
    distance between their centroids is lower than 0.2 (our threshold value). Table

    the non-federated baseline approach presents a 0 % accuracy prediction during
    round 6 (Fig. 10) because we only simulate behavior B5 during this round. During
    round 2, even when Fog B uses FL-Means, it cannot identify the behavior B3 (identical
    to A1) because the Euclidean distance between B3 and A1 is higher than 0.2 (see
    Table 2). Therefore, in this case, FL-Means has an accuracy near the baseline
    approach (Fig. 10). The FL-Means system computes the Euclidean distances between
    similar behaviors above the threshold value for A1 and B3 until round 3 (Table
    2). However, in the following rounds, the distances of A1 and B3 decrease, and
    the system recognizes these behaviors as similar (Table 2). We also verify that
    FL-Means correctly recognizes and merges all other identical behaviors A0 and
    B0, A2 and B4, and A3 and B5 since their first occurrences because the distances
    between their centroids are lower than the threshold value (Table 2). The FL-Means
    system reveals an enormous gain considering the time BDF metric (Fig. 11) because
    it was 1710 times faster in round 4 and 8043 times faster in round 6 than the
    baseline approach, which needs to wait for the next round to identify the new
    behavior correctly. However, FL-Means and baseline are statistically tied in round
    2 because the distance between the behaviors A1 and B3 is not lower than 0.2 at
    this moment (see Table 2), and it needs to wait for the next round to detect the
    behavior B3 individually (see Table 1). In typical situations, we verify that
    both approaches present similar time costs to predict a known behavior in a single
    sample, around 30 ± 2 ms. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download

    of scenario 2 In Scenario 2, we analyze the system scalability, where we send
    two up to 40,000 local centroids to the Cloud-FL component. In our experiment,
    each local centroid refer to the number of fog nodes that send cluster centroids
    to Cloud-FL to generate global centroids (see Section 5.2). Fig. 12 shows that
    the time to compute global centroids for 100 fog nodes is, on average, 0.19 ±

    explores the heterogeneity of fog nodes by using three different hardware configurations:
    Jetson, Raspberry, and PC (see Section 5.3). In this scenario, the fog node generates
    and selects one data model to extract the local centroids (Fig. 1.). For the Time-Local
    metric, we observe that the PC configuration takes 5.85 times lower than Jetson
    and 2.28 times lower than Raspberry (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image

    generate local centroids (Time-Local) and for the fog node to obtain global centroids
    with 100 fog nodes (Time-Global). We also measure the Time-Global metric, which
    consists of a fog node calculating local centroids, sending them to the cloud,
    and receiving the cloud centroids (after the cloud sends the same global centroids
    to another 99 fog nodes). Therefore, the time to obtain the global centroids (Time-Global)
    is formed by the time to compute local fog node centroids, the time for the cloud
    to calculate the global centroids, and the time to receive the centroids from
    the cloud. For the Time-Global, we perceive that PC presents the lowest values
    and that Raspberry takes 1.81 times lower than Jetson for this metric (Fig. 14).
    In Fig. 14, we also discovered that Raspberry demands less time to process local
    centroids than Jetson because the FL-Means code runs on a CPU of 1.43 GHz against
    1.5 GHz of Raspberry Pi 4. In Fig. 15, we note that Time-Pred-FL elapses faster
    for every hardware configuration than Time-Pred-Fog. For Time-Pred-Fog, we observe
    that the PC configuration demands, on average, 7.27 less time to predict a sample
    against the Jetson and 3.76 times less than the Raspberry. We also perceive that
    even using the Jetson configuration, the Time-Pred-FL takes less than 47 ms to
    decide a sample cluster. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download :

    7. Discussion Based on the results, we observed that FL-Means presents accuracy
    and time gains for predicting unknown fog node behaviors. In an IoT scenario where
    at least one fog node has already learned a new behavior, the FL-Means system
    saves other fog nodes time to predict the same behavior when it appears to them
    for the first time. We also highlight that our system can detect new fog node
    behaviors by continuously training local models with the appropriate number of
    behaviors because it uses Calinski–Harabasz validation every round. Scenario 1
    shows that FL-Means does not merge the behaviors A1 and B3 when B3 appears in
    round 2 because the distance between them is higher than 0.2. In round 3, Fog
    B already learns B3 but does not recognize B3 as the same as A1. The distances
    between B3 and A1 only reduce when the behavior B4 appears at the end of round
    4 because B4 has data samples with the highest RAM and CPU usage, changing the
    cluster centroid of B3. We observe that the threshold for behaviors A1 and B3
    is higher than 0.2 in rounds 1 and 2, delaying the system to perceive that behaviors
    A1 and B3 are similar. Also, supposing we set the threshold to 0.1, the FL-Means
    will not detect that behaviors A2 and B4 are similar. Therefore, it is essential
    to report that the threshold value impacts the prediction time and accuracy results.
    Scenario 2 evidences that the cloud side demands more CPU usage and time to compute
    global centroids when the number of fog nodes increases. Scenario 3 shows that
    FL-Means executed correctly for the three different fog node hardware tested.
    We advise using a cloud component to compute the global centroids for fog nodes
    with the same hardware. For example, one Cloud-FL should calculate data from Raspberry
    fog nodes, and the other should receive data from Jetson fog nodes. The FL-Means
    system enhances IoT trustworthiness by enabling every fog node to learn all other
    fog node behaviors faster without sending any local raw data, only transmitting
    the centroids of the clusters, preserving privacy. Also, the FL-Means system supports
    the cloud in monitoring all expected and anomalous fog node behaviors because
    the cloud always receives the behaviors'' centroids from fog nodes. 8. Conclusion
    This paper presents an unsupervised federated learning system (FL-Means). The
    FL-Means system enables a fog-based IoT application to recognize fog node behaviors
    faster when they have already occurred in different fog nodes. It can also detect
    new behaviors by grouping them in clusters using the K-Means algorithm. We assess
    the FL-Means in three Scenarios: (1) when it identifies each fog node behavior
    individually and against a baseline approach (without the federated learning technique),
    (2) testing scalability, and (3) exploring heterogeneity. In Scenario 1, we execute
    the experiments in seven rounds of four minutes each, using a cloud server and
    two fog nodes that we call A and B. The FL-Means system correctly clustered all
    simulated behaviors for both fog nodes individually. In Scenario 1, we evidence
    that using FL-Means, Fog B adequately predicts the unknown behaviors only Fog
    A previously knew. FL-Means reveal 95.8 % accuracy against 79.2 % of the baseline
    in round 4 and 100 % against 0 % of the baseline in round 6. In the same situation,
    the FL-Means system predicts the behaviors in Fog B faster in rounds 4 and 6 than
    in the baseline approach. Examining Scenarios 2 and 3, with 100 fog nodes, we
    observe that the fog node needs to generate the local model and that our federated
    system only requires milliseconds or at least one second more to calculate a global
    model. We also have evidence that predicting a sample behavior using federated
    learning is faster than not using it. Therefore, our approach shows promising
    results for time-critical IoT applications. A complete system to detect anomalies
    and network attacks can be built on top of FL-Means, but we focused on detecting
    performance anomalies related to context. In future work, we intend to reduce
    FL-Means time response and explore fog nodes with distinct kinds of datasets,
    including network attacks. CRediT authorship contribution statement Franklin Magalhães

    rateUplink power control algorithm6G edge cells 1. Introduction To enhance traffic
    capacity in smart infrastructures such as Intelligent transportation systems,
    smart buildings, smart cities, etc., network densification has become crucial
    in various 5G/6G powered applications. This has resulted in increased capacity
    gains, providing more bandwidth within the limited coverage areas of next generation
    nodes (eNBs). However, this comes with the disadvantage of heightened interference,
    both in the uplink and downlink [1,2]. In LTE and other legacy networks, the overlapping
    coverage areas between neighboring eNBs lead to Inter-Cell Interference (ICI),
    which is unavoidable in 5G to prevent coverage gaps. Moreover, in the 5G network,
    the rate of ICI is expected to rise as the number of nodes per square area increases
    due to high network densification requirements [3,4]. Additionally, some proposed
    power ramping requirements for packet loss mitigation [5] raise concerns about
    the energy behavior of mobile user equipment in the network. With the incorporation
    of femtocells, which are primarily customer-driven [6], it is expected that ICI
    will be substantial. This necessitates a more effective mitigation approach that
    is specifically designed to be less complex. Interference in a heterogeneous network
    is primarily mitigated in two ways: power control and resource coordination between
    UEs and eNBs or among eNBs in neighboring cells [7]. Most research in this area
    has employed methods such as Lagrangian maximization functions [8,9], min-median
    functions [10], Reinforcement Learning [11], Overload Indicator (OI) reports,
    and programming schemes [12], combined with power control schemes [13,14]. This
    research has been centered on maximizing cell capacity through SINR improvement
    without considering self-generated interference to adjacent cells. We seek to
    delve into the power control method to mitigate interference at the cell edge
    in a heterogeneous network. While several researchers have explored power control
    in homogeneous and heterogeneous network structures, focusing on either the downlink
    or uplink, and addressing user-specific or neighbor-aware interference mitigation,
    there are still gaps in the existing body of work. Power control (PC), whether
    Open Loop (OL) or Closed Loop (CL), has remained a standard, with CL-PC demonstrating
    promising advantages over OL–PC in a closed system. OL–PC is applied to initiate
    a connection to a network by the UE, while CL–PC is designed to maintain transmit
    power in sync with the base station''s requirements. Some diversification of these
    legacy approaches has been attempted to achieve other forms of power control,
    as seen in [10,15], where in-out interference was considered to determine OL–PC
    parameters. OL–PC parameters are used to initiate connections but lack the ability
    to maintain a fair control approach. Additionally, using OL–PC instead of CL–PC
    to achieve lower power output has been explored. However, no OL–PC approach has
    demonstrated significant gains in a coordinated or shared environment, as users
    tend to act selfishly. Programming approaches have also been employed [13,14]
    applying utility maximization functions and geometric programming (GP) to achieve
    power control for rate maximization, yielding improved results. However, these
    approaches often overlook the impact of other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
    on the network. Another approach involves using the Overload Indicator (OI) as
    a KPI to achieve power control. In [10,15], the focus was on reducing cross-tier
    interference, recognizing that different infrastructures share the same frequency
    bands [16]. The OI was employed to control UE''s transmit power. Since OI is a
    general metric, it cannot be applied specifically to individual interferers but
    rather across the entire network. This may not be effective in a small cell within
    a HetNet for specific UEs. Considerable research has been conducted to determine
    the tolerable transmit power of femtocell users (FUE) within the macro cell coverage
    to avoid cross-tier interference, as demonstrated in [17], [18], [19]. Improved
    results were achieved when considering macro cell users (MUE). However, it is
    apparent that interference suffered by FUEs was not considered, which also influences
    their power requirements. There has yet to be a power control algorithm that considers
    handover as an option in extreme cases when desired results cannot be achieved.
    Interference has remained a leading factor in bandwidth underutilization, and
    in 5G-NR, it remains a major issue, affecting data quality and channel quality.
    High data rate requirements, network densification, and limited energy sources
    pose challenges for efficient energy management, necessitating effective power
    management in the uplink. In this paper, we employed optimal power control for
    a 5G/6G edge user service device and proposed Interference Contribution Rate (ICR)
    to limit neighbor interference rates by continuously evaluating and applying corresponding
    power control parameters. In this process, Self-generated interference is considered
    while recommending handover in cases where power control becomes unfeasible due
    to poor channel quality, and deviation from the expected signal strength. The
    established concerns derived in this paper are summarized below. 1. Wireless Communications
    and Network Densification: How can we mitigate interference effectively in high-density
    5G/6G networks to ensure seamless connectivity for applications like smart health
    and autonomous vehicles? 2. Inter-Cell Interference Management: What novel approaches
    can be developed to address Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) in 5G/6G networks, considering
    the unique challenges posed by network densification and overlapping coverage
    areas?\" 3. Power Control Strategies for Heterogeneous Networks: How can power
    control strategies be optimized to balance SINR improvement and interference reduction
    in heterogeneous networks, considering user-specific needs and neighbor-aware
    interference mitigation? 4. Power Control Algorithm Diversity: What innovative
    techniques can be explored to diversify power control algorithms, particularly
    in coordinated or shared network environments, to promote fairness and mitigate
    selfish user behavior? 5. Multi-KPI Power Control: How can power control algorithms
    be enhanced to consider multiple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) beyond rate
    maximization, ensuring a holistic network performance improvement while mitigating
    interference? 6. Handover and Extreme Cases in Power Control: What strategies
    can be developed to handle power control in extreme cases where conventional methods
    fail due to poor channel quality, with a focus on alternative options like handover,
    especially in small cell HetNets? These research questions narrow into the complexities
    of 5G/6G edge communication network, power optimization, and interference management,
    while providing opportunities for in-depth industry research and innovation in
    the field. The research major contributions are summarized below: 1. To quantify
    Interference Contribution Rate (ICR) for 6G edge user equipment (UE) in heterogeneous
    networks. This represents a novel approach to understanding and managing interference
    in such networks. 2. To derive a harmonized coexistence model with game theory
    between macrocell (MUE) and femtocell users (FUE) while addressing interference
    challenges in heterogeneous networks. 3. To achieve an improved Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise
    Ratio (SINR) for MUEs at the cell edge. This is carried out through coordinated
    transmit power adjustments based on ICR. This contributes to improved data access
    rates for macrocell users. 4. Quantify the trade-off between interference tolerance
    and channel capacity for FUEs. We showed that a controlled compromise of interference
    tolerance can result in substantial channel improvements for both user groups,
    (i.e., Interference Tolerance Trade-off) 5. Employ a coordinated power control
    strategy that allows MUEs and FUEs to work together with minimal overhead, (i.e.,
    Minimal Overhead Coordination). We represented a practical approach to interference
    management in heterogeneous networks. 6. Demonstrate and validate power control
    optimization and handoff schemes. We showed how these effectively mitigates interference
    in heterogeneous networks, contributing to better coexistence and improved network
    performance. 2. Related works In this section, this paper will review the significant
    obstacles that have brought about for edge communications in terms of network
    capacity, data speed, and energy efficiency by the rapid expansion of edge-device
    data services. As a result, the authors [20] notes that current mobile communication
    networks are under tremendous strain. In response to the increasing need for mobile
    services, there has been a lot of focus on the 5G mobile communication in both
    industry and academics. Numerous novel approaches and technological advancements
    have surfaced, such as dense cellular HetNet [21], mmWave [22], and massive MIMO
    [23]. The authors verified that the use of space multiplexing, and massive MIMO
    technology have improved data transmission rates and spectrum efficiency. The
    authors [20] has explored gigahertz-level transmission bandwidth using millimeter
    wave frequencies but in contrast to mmWave and massive MIMO, which mainly benefit
    the physical layer, HetNet [21], which uses densely deployed tiny cells, effectively
    boosts mobile data speeds and system capacity. Deploying a lot of 5G has intensively
    become an effective way to achieve seamless coverage and enough network capacity
    in the hot spots area. This is because a lot of low power small cell facilities,
    like relay nodes, micro base stations, Femto cells, and Pico cells, can divert
    load and increase network capacity [20]. Table presents a summary of various optimization
    schemes and their trade-offs. The major limitations of most related efforts in
    literature include challenges such as co-channel interference affecting IoT traffic,
    power drain in intercell coordination, and difficulties in managing beamforming,
    interference, and resource allocation for optimal efficiency and security in various
    communication scenarios. 3. Environment and experimental methodology In this paper,
    the following materials are utilized to re-design the model in [30]: i. Hardware:
    The Umidigi A9 Pro smartphone featuring a Mali-G72 GPU and a CPU with eight cores,
    operating at a minimum and maximum frequency of 793 MHz and 1807 MHz, respectively.
    ii. Software: Various software tools were employed, including Battery Gauge, AccuBattery/Battery
    Guru, InWare, NetWard/NetMonster, MATLAB software R2020b, and Google Maps. This
    paper designed a heterogeneous network environment encompassing both a macro cell
    and a small cell (femtocell) with a shared interest in cellular coverage, as illustrated
    in Fig. 1. The small cell (FeNB) was deployed randomly, simulating user-deployment,
    thus precluding coordinated or planned (uniform) deployment. This setup allowed
    us to analyse power performance and resource utilization between the Macro User
    Equipment (MUE) and Femto User Equipment (FUE). The aim is to develop a game theory-based
    approach for improved interference management, ultimately leading to system optimization.

    Fig. 1. HetNet system model with 6G edge network domain [30]. 3.1. System model
    Considering a two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), where a femtocell (FeNB)
    is under-laid within the coverage area of the macro-cell as shown in Fig. 1. The
    whole network is assumed to share the whole spectrum (macro and femtocell), meaning
    a reuse factor of one (k = 1), as it is the proposition in fifth-generation new
    radio (5G-NR), due to the scarcity and cost of spectrum, also, the one reuse factor
    is very essential to spectrum efficient utilization. The HetNet under consideration
    will consist of one macro cell (eNB) and a small cell (1-FeNB). 3.2. System assumptions
    i. That FeNB is randomly distributed. ii. The sets of UEs M = {1, 2, 3, …, m}
    served by the eNB, and the sets of FUEs F = {1, 2, 3, …, f} served by the FeNB
    are all randomly deployed. iii. That each UE can only associate with one serving
    node (FeNB or eNB) at a time, iv. That all UEs initially transmit with minimum
    power (Pmin). The received uplink SINR (ɣ) for the UEs served by the eNB (MUE)
    can be expressed as in Eq. (1) while assuming the non-existence of intracell interference
    [20,21]. (1) The received uplink SINR (ɣ) for the UEs served by FeNBs can be expressed
    as in Eq. (2) [20,21]. (2) Where and are the SINR or macro (eNB) and small cell
    users (UEs) respectively, and are transmit power of UEs served by eNB and FeNBs
    within the eNB coverage area respectively, and are the channel gain between FUE
    to FeNB and MUE to eNB while is the noise spectral density of the channel. Both
    MUE and FUE in the network will be taken into account by the power control policy
    as presented in Eq. (3). The total capacity within a channel is given as (3) Where
    and are sub-channel gain, and are transmit power for macro and femtocell users
    respectively, and is the noise spectral density. Gong et al. [22] attempted to
    solve this problem but ended up with a different solution from what is obtained.
    In a non-corporative scenario, the UEs in the network are assumed not to communicate
    with one another. The systems make their individual decisions without the influence
    of the other. Therefore, the decision to be taken is said to be positive only
    when such a decision attains the Nash equilibrium; this is a decision that is
    constrained with the lowest consequence no matter the combination of their outcomes.
    That is, no matter the decision taken by user A, the outcome of user B''s decision
    will still attract low consequences called the penalty. We need to prove concavity
    by taking the second derivative of the function . For If the second derivative
    is positive and the function is said to be concave upward, else if the second
    derivative is negative and the function is said to be concave downward. The second
    derivative of the function yields the equation Since , i.e. negative, the function
    is assumed to be concave Using the gradient method for optimality, we equate to
    zero to yield the optimal power for UEs served by FeNB; (FUE). Solving for Pf:
    (4) 4. Interference models As it is with the 5G/6G network as proposed by the
    3GPP, a reuse factor (K) of one is necessary for enhanced bandwidth utilization
    as against multiple reuse factors used in legacy networks. It is expected that
    two (2) forms of interference will exist in the model presented based on the uplink
    channel; i. Interference from FUE to MeNB ii. Interference from MUE to FeNBs 4.1.
    Edge UE interference contribution rate (ICR) The interference contribution rate
    (ICR) of UEs is taken as the ratio of the interference power caused by the neighboring
    UEs to the sum of reference signal received power (RSRP) of every active UE towards
    the serving eNB and can be obtained as in Eqs. 4(a and b). (4a) (4b) Where, :
    ratio of interference contribution : specific users’ received signal power : Effective
    interference and : transmit power of femtocell and macro cell user and : channel
    gain The ICR value tells the extent to which the user under consideration is suffering
    interference distortions from other users. This gives a sense of direction to
    either increase or decrease the transmit power (according to standards) of the
    sufferer or the interfere respectively, while Eq. (5) determines the expected
    fractional change of the transmit power to achieve the target SINR level. (5)
    The expected change in transmit power is obtained from Eq. (6), which gives the
    limit to which the transmit power can be changed. (6) Where; : difference in SINR
    state N, : Noise and sum of effective interference of MUE/FUE : Fractional Tx
    power incremental/decremental ratio : Required additional fractional Tx power
    to SINR threshold levels. N is the sum of MUEs in the FeNB cell range i M is the
    sum of FUEs in the interfered cell j, while P and G maintain their usual meaning.
    The amount of interference experienced increases as the nature of service used
    differs within the cell range. 4.2. Dynamic power offset The power utilization
    for UEs at the cell center and those at the cell edges need to be balanced systematically
    to maintain some level of acceptable overall quality in the network. Therefore,
    the interference rate experienced by the FeNBs must be examined in a bid to identify
    interferers and apply the power control schemes as appropriate. It is logical
    to apply power control on interferes and not just on the interfered UEs, as this
    should lead to controlling overall power offset in the network. The amount of
    interference that a UE can tolerate (known as effective interference) can be determined
    using Eq. 7. (7) Where; is the maximum tolerable interference is the serving UE''s
    RSRP on RB k is the total interference received in resource block k is the spectral
    noise power Minimum SINR with reference to Mi from Eq. (7) is given in Eq. (8)
    as (8) 4.3. UE system classification The UEs are classified based on application
    as Real-Time (RT) and non-Real-Time (nRT). The RT service UEs require better SINR
    than those of the nRT, therefore, the applied Power Control (PC) will be expected
    to be service-dependent, as the SINR of UEs within the network will vary depending
    on the overall power utilization expected of the FeNB to control interference
    to the MeNB is given as; (9) Although, the SINR can be kept equal for both RT
    and nRT applications in situations where RBs can be dynamically allocated. Allocating
    more RBs to a UE based on data rates or capacity required, even when the dynamic
    allocation of more or fewer RBs is possible; will result in dynamic power allocation
    also. 4.4. Cell edge user identification It is important to identify the UEs at
    the far end of the cell coverage area, as their channel characteristics differ
    from those at close range to the eNB. The cell edge users are characterized by
    low SINR, and RSRP or RSSI; depending on the network or service under consideration.
    The cell edge UEs and the out-of-range UEs can be determined and identified using
    Eqs. 10 and 11 as; (10) (11) When the UEs’ SINR is less or equal to the minimum
    achievable SINR at power (< Pmax) within the cell, the UE is treated as a cell
    edge user, and when the SINR of a UE is far less than the cell threshold SINR
    (minimum allowable SINR), the UE is assumed to be out of range. 4.5. ICR-based
    uplink power control algorithm In this subsection, we assumption: i. FeNB is static
    while FUE has limited mobility (almost static) due to the small coverage of the
    network (10 m). ii. Tx Power of both FUE and MUE is distinctive when there is
    a service change (real and non-real-time). Algorithm 1 is part of larger Cyber-physical
    system for managing interference and controlling the uplink transmission power
    of user equipment in a Femto Cell environment. The specific details of the Equations
    and parameters focused on maintaining the desired signal quality and interference
    control for both MUEs and FUEs. Below is the breakdown of the key steps in Algorithm
    1: Algorithm 1. ICR-based uplink power control algorithm. Empty Cell Inputs: Total
    interference by MUE, Indoor Path gain, Min. SINR, MUE Tx range 1 Outputs: ICR,
    FUE Tx safe range 2 Initialization… 3 For all MUE in FeNB Cell 4 Do: Compute Using

    Power records and ICR Offset 16 Do: Stable User End Initialization: The algorithm
    starts with some initialization steps, decomposed into layers below. Algorithm
    Flow: i. For each MUE in the Femto Cell (FeNB): - Compute a value called P_f^*
    using Eq. (4). - Compute the ICR for the MUE and FUE, as well as I_Eff. ii. Check
    if the calculated ICR for FUE and MUE is less than 1.5. The ICR likely measures
    the quality of the uplink signal. iii. If ICR is less than 1.5, it enters an \"ICR
    Table\" check: - If ICR Table is equal to ∆_tx^+ (not defined in the provided
    code), then: - Compute P_req and increment it by +4 dBm (decibels relative to
    1 milliwatt). - Update the ICR Table and Power records. iv. If ICR Table is not
    ∆_tx^+ (the \"else\" condition), then: - Update the ICR Table and indicate ∆_tx^-
    (again, not defined in the code). - Recommend Handover (likely a suggestion to
    switch to a different cell or access point). v. If the ICR is greater than or
    equal to 1.5, then it implies a more stable user: - Update Power records and ICR
    Offset. - Indicate that it''s a stable user. End Algorithm 1 show the ICR-based
    Uplink Power Control. Assuming a femtocell infrastructure at the cell edge of
    an active macro cell. It is required that the femtocell system (FeNB) computes
    its allowable maximum transmit power using the optimization equation derived .
    The resultant value obtained using this equation is the maximum allowable. According
    to 3GPP, every UE on the LTE-A network begins transmission using the lowest possible
    transmit power and increment by ±4 dBm to expected levels, hence, the ICR is used
    to determine safe transmit power levels due to effective interference suffered
    by the FUE on their respective channels. Where an ICR ratio is greater than 1.5,
    it implies that the user is affected and degraded by interference and either requires
    higher transmit power or their interferers require and downward review of transmit
    power. Alternatively, assuming a femtocell infrastructure at the cell edge of
    an active macro cell. It is required that the femtocell system (FeNB) computes
    its allowable maximum transmit power using the optimization equation derived .
    The resultant value obtained using this equation is the maximum allowable. According
    to 3GPP, every UE on the LTE-A network begins transmission using the lowest possible
    transmit power and increment by ±4 dBm to expected levels, hence, the ICR is used
    to determine safe transmit power levels due to effective interference suffered
    by the FUE on their respective channels. Where an ICR ratio is greater than 1.5,
    it implies that the user is affected and degraded by interference and either requires
    higher transmit power or the interferers require a downward review of the transmit
    power. The ICR Power table is used by MUE/FUE to determine expected adjustments
    in Tx power. Assumption: The FUE are already active and connected indoors. The
    MUE at the cell edge initializes (starts) the connection protocol with eNB. After
    gaining connection using the lowest possible transmit power, the FeNB and eNB
    compute the ICR of both networks as MUE may be suffering from low SINR. If the
    ICR of MUE is less than 1.5, the eNB checks the interference impact on FeNB before
    recommending power adjustments of MUE while referencing the ICR table of FeNB
    as given in Table 1 (a–c). If the ICR table for FeNB indicates / in the balance
    column, it means that the SINR of FUE is above its set threshold for the current
    service deployed and can be adjusted both ways (up/down). Else, if the ICR balance
    column of the FUE shows a only, then it implies that FUE is operating at its SINR
    threshold and has low interference tolerance. This limits any change in transmit
    power of the MUE or FUE, where MUE cannot do with its present SINR, it is regarded
    as out-of-range and recommended to handoff as shown in Fig. 2. Table 1. Related

    4.6. Signal quality-based handoff algorithm Since power control has its limitation
    to channel response, it is pertinent to consider handover as an option at critical
    points (where power control is not feasible). Handoff has been in practice in
    mobile communication to aid mobility and continuity of service. Algorithm 2 focuses
    on real-time users requiring better channel quality for deployed services and
    reducing interference within femtocell coverage areas. Classical handoff algorithms
    use signal strength to determine UE movement, but considering channel quality
    as an indicator is essential, as signal quality and strength can sometimes be
    mutually exclusive. Handoff scheme currently implemented are dependent on the
    signal strength of both service-providing infrastructures. Handoff mechanism used
    in our 6G edge cells (MIMO-networks), is designed such that the edge UE receiver
    can be connected to antennas from both nearby cells'' base stations to get the
    best performance possible during handoff (i.e., multicell handoff). The system
    with weaker signal handoffs to the adjacent system with a stronger signal, while
    hoping that the user is moving toward the system with a stronger signal. In this
    research, it was realized that slow-moving nodes experience scenarios where the
    signal strength may be poor, but with better quality. In this case, the conventional
    handoff algorithm ignores the situation for the fact that the signal strength
    is stronger. Although handoff based on signal quality seems more complex when
    compared with signal strength, signal quality remains more energy efficient when
    deployed on slowly mobile or static nodes at the cell edge. We later investigated
    the computational complexity, and the findings show that in the situation of high
    spatial correlation, the multicell handoff improves average CPU throughput with
    lower CC. Algorithm 2. RSRQ-based handoff algorithm. 1: INPUT: , 2: Initialize

    Received Quality, M_th is a threshold value for some parameter M_i, and SINR stands
    for Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio. The RSRQ-Based Handoff Algorithm
    is another layer of the Cyber physical communication system for the edge cellular
    network. It seems to be a handoff algorithm for Real-Time Mobile User Equipment
    (MUE) in a Femtocell (FeNB) cell. Here''s a step-by-step breakdown of how the
    Algorithm 2 works: Input Parameters: • M_th: A threshold value for some parameter
    M_i. • SINR_th: A threshold value for Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio.
    • RSRQ_th: A threshold value for Reference Signal Received Quality. Algorithm
    Steps: 1. Loop through all Real-Time MUEs in the Femtocell (FeNB) cell. 2. In
    real time individual MUE, calculate and , 3. With control decision mapping check
    for critical thresholds and modulate effectively. 4. Compare and further initiate
    active handoff for power control 5. If M_i is not greater than M_th or if SINR_UE
    is not less than SINR_th, there is no need for a handoff or power control, so
    the UE continues operating in the current cell. As shown above, Algorithm 2 depicts
    the RSRQ-based handoff scheme. The handoff algorithms currently implemented are
    dependent on the signal strength of both service-providing infrastructures. The
    system with weaker signal handoffs to the adjacent system with a stronger signal,
    while hoping that the user is moving toward the system with a stronger signal.
    In this research, it was realized that slow-moving nodes experience scenarios
    where the signal strength may be poor, but with better quality. In this case,
    the conventional handoff algorithm ignores the situation for the fact that the
    signal strength is stronger. Although handoff based on signal quality seems more
    complex when compared with signal strength, signal quality remains more energy
    efficient when deployed on slowly mobile or static nodes at the cell edge. The
    real-time user is determined by the interferer with the highest ICR value whose
    SINR is less than the SINR threshold. As the network routinely checks for interferers
    and reports by updating the ICR table, the highest interferers are treated for
    handoff operation as given in Fig. 3. The handoff process initializes only when
    there is an interferer whose power requirement cannot be controlled within the
    limited resources. According to the algorithm presented above, the process initializes
    by updating its measurements on SIR, RSRP and RSRQ of its user and adjacent channels
    (if available). The SIR value of UE is compared to the set threshold and the Mi
    value is evaluated as given in Eq. 7 to consider the tolerance level of FUE. If
    SIR is below the threshold and the Mi is above tolerable levels, the RSRQ of the
    user and the adjacent channel is compared and evaluated. If the RSRQ of the user
    is less than the adjacent RSRQ, a handoff request will be issued and processed,
    otherwise, the process is returned to the power control stage. Download : Download

    handoff procedure. 5. Computational complexity (CC) A major challenge in 5G/6G
    edge cells is the computational complexity of the massive MIMO systems discussed
    previously. The CC of a hand-off mechanism refers to the number of computational
    resources required to execute the necessary tasks when transitioning a connection
    or device from one access point or network node to another seamlessly. The complexity
    varied based on the handoff technique for edge device stream exchanges in 6G edge
    cells. For the 6G edge cell infrastructure, first, the identified factors affecting
    the established complexity include algorithmic decision-making, information exchange
    between node devices, access points, resource management during hand-offs, and
    the timing and efficiency of the hand-off process. These elements impact the computational
    traffic workload involved in initiating seamless transitions between network cell
    connections. Now, the CC is described in terms of Big O notation. This characterizes
    the hand-off scalability considering the input data size for 6G Cells. The number
    of edge nodes and network-state conditions are considered also. The hand-off mechanisms
    had on-demand complexities described as O(1) (constant time), O(log n) (logarithmic
    time), O(n) (linear time), as well as higher complexities O(n^2) (quadratic time),
    depending on the specific edge device on-demand tasks and the efficiency of the
    algorithm. Since the complexity varies across different hand-off schemes and network
    types, this paper employed low computational complexity scheme, (i.e., approximate
    matrix conversion) to ensure seamless transitions without introducing significant
    delays and overhead in the network. The proposed hand-off mechanism offers balance
    efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness while minimizing computational overhead.
    Also, due to the use of approximation algorithm for handoff, the CC reduced from
    order to order . The approximation algorithms have less CC than the other handoff
    proposed algorithms [31]. Considering the 6G MIMO system, we used the work [31]
    to compare high-CPU dimensional matrix computations during handoffs. For 6G edge
    cells, minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm prioritize low complexity, hence
    three distinct handsoff mechanisms are discussed viz: the proposed approximate
    matrix conversion MMSE (HO-AMCMMSE), iterative MMSE (HO-IMMSE) and matrix gradient
    search MMSE (HO-MGSMMSE). The CPU utilization rates during various handover processes
    were observed in Fig. 3b. During HO-IMMSE, the CPU usage peaked at 85.42 %; HO-AMCMMSE
    offered 77.78 % usage, while HO-MGSMMSE offered 81.93 % CPU utilization. The overall
    CC of an inverse matrix Handoff-mechanism decreases when compared to the usual
    iterative, and matrix gradient search schemes as shown in Fig. 3b. However, its
    necessary to note that the proposed handoff-mechanism is designed in such a way
    that at higher SNRs, the bit error rate is reduced. Hence, the CC in the coding
    and decoding blocks are optimally reduced. This suggests that in large-scale networks,
    the handoff-based approach is more scalable. Download : Download high-res image

    The significance of Fig. 3b is that with the reduced CC, it took less than 4 s
    to evaluate channel quality based on error rate, and coding scheme correction
    as scheduled to make a handoff recommendation. However, the parameters required
    for this process are basic entries already defined within an edge cell system.
    In this handoff-mechanism case, the uplink channel quality is evaluated continuously
    (periodic, aperiodic, or on request) during active and standby mode by the 6G
    base station. With reduced CC, there was minimal additional energy demand placed
    on the mobile edge equipment. It''s worth noting that the user equipment (UE)
    concurrently measures and reports downlink channel quality as part of the channel
    state information (CSI), crucial for informing the 6G base station''s decisions
    regarding power control and other parameter adjustments. 6. Results 6.1. New power
    control algorithm implementation First, we used the simulation parameters [30]
    to implement our model. This was considered to provide a guide between the Femto
    and Macro cell user coexistence in transmit power control during real-time and
    non-real-time service deployment. Fig. 4 shows improved interference levels leading
    to an optimized FUE transmit power based on collaborative power-interference ratios,
    while the FUE SINR in this case is protected from aggressive greedy MUE. The FUE
    data shows a consistent positive trend, with each interference value generally
    increasing by around 0.9–0.97 from the previous value. This suggests that the
    number of Femtocell users is increasing steadily over time. Similarly, the MUE
    data also shows a positive trend, with each increasing by approximately 0.9–0.97.
    Both cell users are experiencing a positive trend, with the number of users increasing
    over time. Download : Download high-res image (372KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. FUE optimized power. 6.2. Interference between MUE and FUE coexistence
    The FUE interference towards the MUE as presented in Fig. 5 was observed to be
    minimal at lower power levels up to 18 dBm, whereas, the MUE interference was
    high all through to 23 dBm which is the maximum allowed for every UE within the
    network. It is interesting to note that the algorithm does not allow the FUE transmit
    power to rise beyond 22 dBm while the MUE can attain such power levels and even
    more. The MUE data shows a consistent positive trend, with each value generally
    increasing by around 7.67–12.08 from the previous value. This suggests that the
    number of Macro Cell users is steadily increasing over time. At a transmit power
    of 15 dBm, the FUE can go almost unnoticed in interference by the MUE as this
    generates a very low level of interference signal allowing for better rates on
    the MUE. Therefore, aiming the transmit power of the FUE at lower rates while
    protecting its SINR levels within the threshold was an appropriate step to take.
    It can be observed that restricting the transmit power of the FUE at 18 dBm caused
    a slight improvement of the data rate of the cell edge MUE user by about 4 Mbps,
    while the FUE got a degraded service of about 12.5 Mbps in the rate at maximum
    transmit power. From Fig. 5, the interference generated by FUE remained the same
    (relatively constant) as against those of MUE showing increased interference levels
    as distance increased. This shows that with power control, the FUE is not an interferer
    to the MUE in the uplink. Download : Download high-res image (386KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. MUE and FUE interference levels. Without placing
    any limit on the FUE transmit power, it can be observed from Fig. 6 that FUE was
    able to achieve 40 Mbps under 10 dB of interference amounting to 11.76 dB in SINR,
    while the MUE achieved 15 Mbps on a similar interference level at 2.62 dB in SINR
    value. Without restricting the FUE transmit power to 18 dBm, the MUE at the cell
    edge suffered from low SINR levels to the range of 0.86 dB as against 2.62 dB
    in FUE restricted transmit power. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that the implementation
    of ICR on FUE showed an improvement in the rate from 27.5 Mbps to 30.25 Mbps which
    amounts to about 3 Mbps of rate gained in the bid to maintain an acceptable SINR
    threshold of 9 dB for FUE. The ICR action of SINR threshold recovery only caused
    a slight degradation of the MUE date rate from about 15 Mbps to 14 Mbps (1 Mbps),
    translating to an SINR level of 0.07 dB. Download : Download high-res image (456KB)

    ICR-based rate improvement. The FUE values seem to decrease initially from 0 to
    40 Mbps, indicating a decline in data rate. At the beginning, FUE is at 0 and
    gradually increases to 33.5 Mbps and then suddenly drops to 30.5 Mbps at 37 Mbps,
    showing some fluctuations. Afterward, it continues to decrease, reaching 27.5
    at 40 Mbps. The MUE values also show a similar trend to FUE, starting at 2 and
    gradually increasing to 8.9 at 33.5 Mbps, and then experiencing a significant
    increase. The MUE then continues to rise from 8.9 to 15.2 at 40 Mbps. Overall,
    both FUE and MUE initially follow a somewhat linear trend with fluctuations and
    then show an accelerated increase. 6.3. ICR implementation to power control The
    role of the optimization algorithm is to evaluate the initial transmit power when
    FUE is within the eNB cell, as MUE is already connected. In this way, the FUE
    allowable transmit power (Txmax) is evaluated by Eq. (4). After the initial evaluation,
    it becomes unnecessary to carry out re-evaluation, as the optimization equation
    ensures that the FUE does not become an interferer at the entry point because
    ITU specified UE Tx power initializing from least possible to maximum allowed
    in steps of 4 dBm. Hence, the necessity for an ICR-based uplink power control
    algorithm (ICR-UPCA) that can estimate the cost and benefit of power control within
    the network. ICR showed the capability of fractional power control, by performing
    power adjustment of either FUE or MUE with cost and profit estimation for SINR
    improvement of either user. Figs. 6 and 7 showed ICR-power level correction such
    that fractional power change of FUE posed no significant effect on the MUE. Whereas,
    it is possible to trade signal quality between both network structures. In Fig.
    7, 6.67 % was traded in channel capacity to gain 12.5 % which translates to about
    4 Mbps and 1 Mbps channel improvement respectively for the MUE at the cell edge.
    In conclusion, ICR-UPCA is effective at critical points where power is essential.
    It can be seen that the collaboration between the FeNB and MeNB in interference
    mitigation yielded improved results and ultimately improved the MUE network experience
    at the cell edge while protecting the femtocell users. The interference contribution
    rate (ICR) is crucial for UE power adjustment considering other users. It can
    be used to examine the impact on other users before making adjustments. Fig. 7
    illustrates the ICR''s impact on macro cell user SINR when adjusting the femtocell
    SINR target. The amount of loss in data rate as a result of the degraded channel
    as shown in Fig. 7 was negligible even though the gains of 4 Mbps to FUE were
    appreciable. 6.4. Signal quality-based handoff algorithm The handoff algorithm
    was assessed, and the findings are depicted in Fig. 8. As channel quality improved,
    the handoff rate decreased, while the network''s tolerance to interference increased,
    especially when transitioning to stronger interferers. The system''s handoff algorithm
    was activated by fluctuations in the Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ)
    indicator, which correlated with interference and path loss. According to the
    results presented, the handoff probability decreased from 0.83 to 0.58 with improving
    channel quality. It was observed from the data presented that the power utilization
    of the macro cell user (MUE) was improved. This was a result of handoffs of higher
    interferers for better quality channels, as less energy is required for communication.
    To control handoff rates in the network, UEs are handed off based on the maximum
    interference contributed. Download : Download high-res image (465KB) Download

    7. Result validation The results obtained are validated using the Fractional power
    control (FPC) scheme [32]. The scheme is introduced and deployed based on path
    loss compensation [33,34]. The UE makes efforts to transmit at a rate required
    to overcome path loss by increasing its transmit power according to a set compensation
    ratio. In Fig. 9, the achieved rate at lower interference levels of MUE by the
    FPC scheme was observed to be up to 30.7 Mbps at Txmax. Whereas the proposed scheme
    achieved 11.5 Mbps and 15.1 Mbps when FUE Txmax is limited to 18 dBm. This was
    so because the FPC did not consider the existence of the FUE as the scheme is
    focused on overcoming path loss without interference considerations. Also, from
    the FUE side, the scheme acted as though in isolation. The proposed scheme was
    better suitable for a coordinated HetNet environment. Download : Download high-res
    image (399KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. MUE rate – FPC and proposed
    scheme. In Fig. 10, the FPC scheme generated higher interference signals of about
    7.8 dBm, while the proposed scheme generated about 5.5 dBm in simulated results
    to the FUE which extremely degraded the FUE network. This can be ascribed to its
    higher data rate recorded in Fig. 9. Whereas the proposed scheme showed good tolerance
    in coexistence between both networks and was able to balance the demands of each
    network within available resources. The proposed scheme provided for improved
    SINR to the cell edge MUE while ensuring that the FUE SINR threshold of 9 dB was
    protected. Download : Download high-res image (400KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. FPC and ICR-based interference contribution. In Fig. 11, the channel
    capacity of the FUE is depicted, revealing a degradation to approximately 0.2
    Mbps. This is in stark contrast to the rates maintained by the ICR-based scheme,
    which achieves about 40.2 Mbps and 27.3 Mbps for unfixed and fixed Txmax, respectively.
    The imposition of an 18 dBm maximum power to the FUE demonstrates improved performance
    compared to the Fixed Power Control (FPC) scheme, especially in a heterogeneous
    environment (HetNet). The limitations of the FPC scheme become evident in such
    a setting, as it is solely path loss-driven and lacks consideration for the FUE''s
    location relative to other cells. This oversight results in high interference
    with its immediate neighbors, as illustrated by the FUE''s performance in Fig.
    11. The success of the ICR contribution lies in its ability to dynamically adjust
    the power levels of individual User Equipment (UE) in the network, thereby enhancing
    Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) without negatively impacting co-channel
    users. The capability to assign and reassign SINR thresholds to users, coupled
    with the optimization of less useful power levels, confers a distinct advantage
    to the ICR-based scheme. Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download :

    of eNB power measurements (i.e., ICR-UPCA), the signal strength of the designated
    base station (eNB) was measured along one of its sectors, ensuring an unobstructed
    line of sight to mitigate any compromise in results. The primary objective was
    to identify the cell edge, where handover is most likely to occur. Despite efforts
    to minimize interference from trees and high-rise buildings, these inevitably
    served as potential sources of signal reflections. Experimental efforts were made
    to steer clear of taking measurements in proximity to such structures. Additionally,
    power lines posed a concern and were unavoidable at specific points. Overall,
    the acquired results proved reasonably robust for analysis, aligning with the
    anticipated theoretical power decay constant. Fig. 12 illustrates this trend with
    distances and their corresponding power levels. The recorded power levels demonstrated
    the expected decay in signal strength, with some observed fluctuations as the
    covered distance increased across ten different locations within the same cell
    and sector. Download : Download high-res image (150KB) Download : Download full-size

    near the base station (eNB) tower, aligning with theoretical expectations. Conversely,
    higher power levels were recorded toward the cell center, gradually decreasing
    as we moved toward the cell edge, signaling an impending handover. The diminishing
    signal strength had a noticeable impact on the measured Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise
    Ratio (SINR) within the same network. Fig. 13 illustrates this impact, depicting
    SINR values at distances. The corresponding SINR values were recorded. The degrading
    signal quality further manifested in the SINR measurements as we approached the
    cell edge. This phenomenon can be attributed to path loss and various other channel-degrading
    factors. Download : Download high-res image (131KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 13. Measured eNB SINR. At 900 m from the eNB, the handover sequence
    was triggered. This initiation led to the detection of a signal from an adjacent
    cell, characterized by superior signal strength compared to the deteriorating
    signal at the current location. Again, the signal strength at distances of 93
    m and 100 m from the base station was notably weak, indicating proximity to the
    cell''s outer boundary. Within the range of 150–300 m, we considered the cell
    center, signal strength significantly improved, particularly with a clear line
    of sight, resulting in better signal quality. Expanding beyond this range from
    350 m to 658 m, extends to the cell edge, characterized by notably lower signal
    strength. At the 658 m, there was an overlap in cell signals with adjacent cells,
    resulting in an inconsistent handoff point. Handoffs occurred randomly around
    the ±658 m range, indicating an unfixed transition point between cells. Notably,
    at the point of handoff (658 m or point 9), the recorded signal showed a higher
    Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). It appeared evident that the handoff
    was not initiated due to the slow movement of the testing device toward the 6G
    cell edge. Considering UE hardware power utilization analysis, it was observed
    that hardware subsystems, particularly the UE screen, constituted a significant
    power consumption point with high energy dissipation. The screen and processors
    emerged as crucial functional components during the measurements. To maintain
    simplicity and consistency, the brightness level of the UE screen remained constant
    throughout the process. A critical aspect of the investigation involved assessing
    the impact of the UE''s processors and graphic processing unit (GPU) system on
    energy consumption. Table 3 illustrates the processor clocking activities spanning
    from the center to the edge of the macro cell coverage area. This provides insights
    into the variations in processor activity across different locations within the
    coverage area. In terms of UE processor activity, the depicted processor activities
    in Table 3 revealed instances of elevated processor engagement, particularly notable
    during services such as video calls and voice-only calls. This heightened activity
    suggests a potential for increased power utilization. Interestingly, services
    like video streaming did not exhibit a consistent trend but instead indicated
    vulnerabilities to path loss, with variations linked to increasing distances toward
    the cell edge. This distinction in service behavior led to the classification
    of applications into two categories: real-time and non-real-time applications.
    Real-time applications, exemplified by video calls and voice-only calls, demonstrated
    higher processor activities and, consequently, potential for heightened power
    consumption. On the other hand, non-real-time applications, such as video streaming,
    displayed susceptibility to path loss variations as distances increased toward
    the cell edge. Appendix I (a-f) shows the various traffic workload for edge devices
    (See GitHub code: https://github.com/ken-cisco/ICR-UPCA.cpp.git). Table 3. Measured

    illustrates notable processor activities during idle mode at the cell center and
    cell edge (idle C & E). Notably, at the cell edge, the second half of the quad-core
    processors exhibited higher engagement, whereas similar responses were observed
    at the cell center, resulting in an average distinction in response. During the
    voice call application (voice call. E & C), identical readings were recorded for
    all 8 processor clocks at both cell edge and center. Distinct processor clocking
    activities were observed during the video streaming application (video stream
    E & C). However, there was no significant difference between these activities
    due to the relatively consistent clocking response from cell edge to cell center,
    with an alternation of highly clocked processor sets. Download : Download high-res

    clocking. At the cell center, the first 4 sets of processors ran at lower clocking
    speeds compared to the other 4, while at the cell edge, the first 4 sets were
    clocked higher, and the other 4 were clocked lower. Nevertheless, this did not
    substantiate the argument of processor-induced additional power utilization from
    the center to the edge of the macro cell network. Examining the video call application
    from cell center to cell edge (video call E.C), higher processor clocking was
    observed compared to other applications mentioned earlier. However, an alternation
    of processor clocking from the first four sets to the others indicated that processor
    activities did not significantly change from cell center to cell edge, thus not
    justifying any difference in energy utilization during power measurement and analysis.
    The maximum power utilized by the processor was not considered in the analysis
    due to manufacturer restrictions. The UE power, as presented in Table 2 and depicted
    in Fig. 15, revealed spikes in power utilization during real-time service deployment.
    The offline and online power during UE idle mode correlated with the distance
    covered toward the cell edge. Online video stream and offline voice call services
    generated distinct power levels within the same network environment and coverage
    distance. Notably, online video call streaming utilized distinct power levels
    higher than any other deployed application by the user equipment (UE). This observation
    led to the categorization of power levels into Real-time (RT) and non-Real time
    (nRT) in updating the ICR table. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download

    8. Discussion Essentially, the power optimization model in Eq. 4 was used to determine
    the FUE Txmax. For every MUE Tx power that generates interference levels above
    the FUE tolerance band, the ICR was determined with further analysis in Appendix
    A. Eqs. 7 and 8 was deployed for ICR and SINR threshold determination. The ICR-based
    power control was applied to determine the rate of interference suffered by users
    and the extent of power adjustment required. ICR evaluation was carried out on
    both FUE and MUE, this made it possible to understand the interference status
    of every user while balancing the rates gained within the shared channel. It becomes
    easier to protect the FUE while maintaining an improved cell edge user channel
    quality. Using the optimization equation in Eq. 4, the maximum Tx evaluated for
    MUE and FUE was 200 mW and 191 mW respectively. From simulations done, FUE becomes
    an interferer to MUE only at Tx power of about 51 mW and above. The maximum data
    rate achievable by FUE and MUE at the cell edge was possibly controlled at 27.5
    Mbps for fixed Tx power at 18 dBm and 15 Mbps respectively, as SINR was maintained
    at 15 dB for FUE and 1 dB for MUE. The two identified contributions of the proposed
    scheme are: • Improved SINR Levels: The implementation of the Interference Contribution
    Rate-based Uplink Power Control Algorithm (ICR-UPCA) led to a substantial improvement
    in SINR levels for users at the cell edge. This dynamic adjustment of uplink power
    effectively mitigated interference, resulting in enhanced signal quality. • Efficient
    Handoffs: The Handoff Algorithm based on Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ)
    significantly improved the efficiency of handovers between cells. This optimization
    contributed to higher SINR levels during transitions, ensuring uninterrupted service
    for users on the move. 8.1. Limitation Though the proposed power control algorithm
    introduces a cooperative approach between edge nodes to achieve an advantage on
    the shared spectrum, the identified implementation concerns are highlighted below.
    i. In such advanced power control algorithm, this may provide difficulties because
    of their intricate computational structure, which makes decision-making and implementation
    more difficult. ii. Regardless of the energy optimization benefits, this could
    use a lot of processing power especially in complex workloads, negating any potential
    energy savings. iii. Controlling device interference in dense networks is difficult
    and affects algorithm performance. iv. Furthermore, the computing needs of these
    algorithms large scale Cyber-physical environment may introduce intrinsic latency
    in communication, (which will impact real-time applications where delay is critical,
    e.g., remote operations and autonomous cars). v. In 5G/6G networks, reduced computing
    complexity may limit accuracy, scalability, flexibility, and security issues while
    also stifling innovation. Similar to the work [34], the proposed power control
    algorithm is limited to low-complexity power control. It is useful in scenarios
    where frequency reuse factors do not apply, and there is the coexistence of network
    hierarchical structures that could cause Inter-cell interference (ICI). Although
    the work [35] addressed the issue of efficient power control in heterogeneous
    networks using deep learning, the downside is the high computational complexity
    for edge-connected connections. As such the work [36], used a joint power allocation
    approach and employed fast evolutionary algorithm. The proposed scheme lacks multi-agent
    deep reinforcement learning approach to handle complexities caused by ICI. It
    only supports spectrum sharing and coexistence between nodes with different network
    structures. Overall, the utilization of the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
    (DRL) algorithm, as well as related concepts found in [34], [35], [36], [37],
    can be explored to solve the problems, with tradeoffs that highlight computational
    complexities during handoff. 9. Conclusion In this paper, we studied an effective
    approach to the problem of suboptimal Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio
    (SINR) experienced by macro cell users at the cell edge, even within a femtocell
    network. The objective is to effectively utilize the 5G-NR radio spectrum for
    user data transmission while minimizing overhead. The increasing interference
    levels require a cohesive approach that combines network infrastructures and interference
    control. In this paper, user services are categorized into real-time and non-real
    time, which is essential for customizing SINR improvement efforts. Two innovative
    solutions are developed. First, Interference Contribution Rate-based Uplink Power
    Control Algorithm (ICR-UPCA), which dynamically adjusts uplink power levels based
    on real-time interference, effectively mitigating interference and elevating SINR.
    Second, Handoff Algorithm based on Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) was
    introduced to optimize handovers between cells to further enhance SINR and service
    quality. The proposed handoff-mechanisms showed an improved performance with lower
    Computational complexity, better quality of service, optimal utilization of the
    5G-NR radio spectrum. These contribute to a more robust and optimized 5G-NR network,
    while ensuring satisfactory user experience. Future work will focus on implementing
    ICR-UPCA within a HetNet network i.e., Heterogeneous Cyber-Physical Networks (HCPNs)
    deployed in the context of 6G-NR. Also, conducting an in-depth investigation on
    the security limitations inherent in the edge nodes within a functional femtocell
    infrastructure for closed subscriber group mode (CSG) will be carried out. An
    investigation on RSRQ-based handoff algorithm using Reinforcement learning (RL)
    to predict and minimize interference patterns will be explored. The other future
    applications are advanced game theory, evolutionary algorithms, federated learning,
    and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using heuristic optimization algorithms (i.e..,
    ant colony optimization and simulated annealing. Ultimately, the aim is to develop
    a multi-facted hybrid model that will provide optimal interference management
    and uplink power control solutions in 6G edge cells within HCPNs by integrating
    various AI techniques. Financial support This work was supported in part by the

  description: The Agri-Food sector is in a stressful situation due to the high demand
    for food from the growing population around the world. The agricultural sector
    is facing a challenging situation; it must increase production and reduce its
    impact on the environment by appropriately allocating resources, adapting to climate
    change, and avoiding food waste. Agriculture 5.0, as the fifth agricultural evolution,
    aims to offer a perfect symbiosis between agriculture, advanced technologies,
    and sustainability. The most advanced technologies in automation, monitoring,
    and decision support are driven by the collection and processing of large volumes
    of agricultural data, such as weather information, farm machinery, soil and crop
    conditions, and marketing demand for higher profits. Taking advantage of the technological
    paradigm of the Internet of Things, agricultural data provides information on
    spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. Spatio-temporal semantic data management
    systems have become the cornerstone for the achievement of Agriculture 5.0 through
    advanced Internet of Things technologies. This paper aims to review the current
    literature on spatio-temporal semantic data management systems for Agriculture
    5.0. This paper uses a systematic literature review technique to study eleven
    representative spatio-temporal semantic data management systems. A comprehensive
    evaluation of the aspects of interoperability, accessibility, scalability, real-time
    operation capability, etc. is carried out. Based on the evaluation results, future
    challenges are detected and development trends and possible improvements are proposed
    for future research. Finally, a distributed architecture capable of satisfying
    the above needs and challenges is proposed. The paper aims to inspire further
    research and development efforts to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and
    performance of spatio-temporal semantic data management systems.

    systems. • A distributed architecture is proposed that meets the needs of Spatio-Temporal
    Data Management Systems for agriculture. Abstract The Agri-Food sector is in a
    stressful situation due to the high demand for food from the growing population
    around the world. The agricultural sector is facing a challenging situation; it
    must increase production and reduce its impact on the environment by appropriately
    allocating resources, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. Agriculture
    5.0, as the fifth agricultural evolution, aims to offer a perfect symbiosis between
    agriculture, advanced technologies, and sustainability. The most advanced technologies
    in automation, monitoring, and decision support are driven by the collection and
    processing of large volumes of agricultural data, such as weather information,
    farm machinery, soil and crop conditions, and marketing demand for higher profits.
    Taking advantage of the technological paradigm of the Internet of Things, agricultural
    data provides information on spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. Spatio-temporal
    semantic data management systems have become the cornerstone for the achievement
    of Agriculture 5.0 through advanced Internet of Things technologies. This paper
    aims to review the current literature on spatio-temporal semantic data management
    systems for Agriculture 5.0. This paper uses a systematic literature review technique
    to study eleven representative spatio-temporal semantic data management systems.
    A comprehensive evaluation of the aspects of interoperability, accessibility,
    scalability, real-time operation capability, etc. is carried out. Based on the
    evaluation results, future challenges are detected and development trends and
    possible improvements are proposed for future research. Finally, a distributed
    architecture capable of satisfying the above needs and challenges is proposed.
    The paper aims to inspire further research and development efforts to improve
    the efficiency, accessibility, and performance of spatio-temporal semantic data
    management systems. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Data

    management system (STSDMS) 1. Introduction The integration of advanced technologies
    into agriculture is driven by the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) [1] and the welfare of animals [2]. Since 2015, the global population suffering
    from hunger has increased dramatically, reaching a percentage of at least 9% of
    the population worldwide [3]. If the current trend continues, the Zero Hunger
    Goal [4] will not be achieved by 2030. Targets 2.3 and 2.a of the Zero Hunger
    goal seek to double agricultural productivity and increase research in the field
    of agriculture. The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture
    offers solutions for task automation, crop and livestock monitoring, and decision
    support, among others. Thanks to the IoT, the achievement of Agriculture 5.0 or
    the digitization of agriculture offers the solution to the growing demand for
    food, reducing the environmental impact and increasing productivity, efficiency,
    and accuracy in the development of agricultural tasks. The Internet of Things
    paradigm is based on the extraction of knowledge through raw data generated by
    devices, sensors, and various agents deployed in the fields. The huge volumes
    of data provide semantic, geolocalized, and time-varying information. For this
    reason, specific data management systems are needed for Agriculture 5.0, capable
    of managing data of a spatio-temporal semantic nature. These systems are called
    Spatio-Temporal Semantic Data Management Systems (STSDMSs). However, the implementation
    of STSDMSs currently presents numerous challenges in modern agriculture: • Increase
    in the number of connected agricultural devices: According to Machina’s research
    report, the number of connected agricultural devices at the end of 2014 was 13
    million and is expected to reach 225 million by 2024 [5]. The growing number of
    connected devices translates into the generation of large volumes of data. To
    enable the growing demand, advanced data management systems must be more specialized,
    scalable, and capable of providing data injection and retribution functions, as
    well as processing capabilities for large volumes of data. • Connectivity challenges:
    Most agricultural scenarios are located in rural areas, with low connectivity
    capacities [6]. Therefore, it is increasingly important to bring computing capabilities
    closer to the edge, reducing bandwidth and delays introduced in communication
    with centralized data management systems in the cloud. • Diversity of agricultural
    data models: The huge amount of heterogeneous data generated by agricultural devices
    is one of the main challenges in data management today. Due to the absence of
    standards for agricultural data modeling, current devices, and solutions are developed
    based on native data models [7]. Furthermore, integration between data management
    systems and current solutions is limited by the lack of interoperability generated
    by the diversity of models. This translates into major efforts in the development
    of gateways or translator components. • Spatio-temporal semantic data: The latest
    solutions in modern agriculture integrate, among others, the monitoring and tracking
    of livestock with the use of collars [8] and automation of tasks with autonomous
    or semi-autonomous vehicles such as ISOBUS machines or tractors [9] or UAVs for
    pesticide spraying or crop monitoring. Definitely, the devices deployed in current
    agricultural scenarios offer information characterized in the spatial, temporal,
    and semantic dimensions. However, the development of data management systems capable
    of providing optimal performance in queries and operations based on the three
    dimensions remains a major challenge for current agricultural data management
    systems. • Accessibility for farmers: Sensing and subsequent management of agricultural
    data provides a valuable tool for the farmer to make more informed decisions and
    plan tasks. In addition, real-time data management enables anomaly detection capabilities
    as well as support for task re-planning and adaptation. However, the query interfaces
    of data management systems are mainly oriented towards technical staff or developers.
    Simplifying graphical user interfaces (GUIs) enables their use by the end user,
    the farmer, the livestock farmer, or the agricultural specialist [10]. In this
    context, the effective management of spatio-temporal data becomes essential. Spatio-temporal
    data refers to information that not only captures the spatial characteristics
    and geopositioning of agricultural IoT agents but also includes the temporal dimension,
    allowing for a comprehensive understanding of dynamic processes in the agricultural
    landscape. The management of such data involves the collection, storage, integration,
    analysis, and visualization of spatio-temporal information, facilitating informed
    decision-making and optimizing agricultural practices. After identifying the problems
    and limitations of modern agriculture in the implementation of data management
    systems, this paper provides a review of the current literature on STSDMSs for
    Agriculture 5.0. The central research question guiding this work is: “What is
    the current status of STSDMSs in Agriculture 5.0?”. To answer this question, a
    careful selection of the most relevant systems in the management of spatio-temporal
    semantic data for agriculture is made. Then, an exhaustive review and evaluation
    of the literature associated with these selected systems is carried out, identifying
    the current challenges derived from the limitations previously discussed. It is
    important to note that this study is based on a literature review and does not
    include performance tests of the selected STSDMSs. The final purpose of this paper
    is to provide a clear overview of the current state of the art in this field and,
    at the same time, to identify potential areas of research and development for
    future researchers and experts in the field. The current challenges and limitations
    of spatio-temporal semantic data management systems in Agriculture 5.0 are addressed.
    Issues such as data interoperability, scalability, accessibility, and real-time
    operation will be discussed, along with potential solutions and future directions
    for research and development. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding
    of STSDMSs for the achievement of Agriculture 5.0, highlighting its importance,
    current advances, and potential to drive innovation in the agricultural sector.
    Through a systematic review and evaluation of challenges in this field, this article
    aims to inspire new research and development efforts that improve the efficiency,
    sustainability, and productivity of modern agricultural systems. Section 2 describes
    the evolution of agriculture towards agricultural digitalization or Agriculture
    5.0, highlighting the advanced technologies used to achieve it, as well as the
    objective of this new paradigm. Based on the five challenges and limitations of
    data management in modern agriculture outlined in this introduction, Section 3
    selects and presents eleven STSDMSs from the current literature, developed in
    this context. Section 4 provides the literature evaluation of the eleven STSDMSs
    selected. After evaluation, current challenges are identified and future research
    lines are discussed to address them. Based on the challenges detected and after
    outlining the research lines that have resulted, Section 5 offers a proposal capable
    of solving them, describing the architecture and the most novel and attractive
    technologies for their implementation. Finally, Section 6 draws conclusions from
    the results of this study. 2. Agriculture 5.0 and STSDMSs Agriculture 5.0 represents
    a transformative approach to agriculture that integrates advanced technologies,
    data analytics, and automation to revolutionize the agricultural sector. It builds
    on the foundations of previous agricultural generations, such as subsistence agriculture
    (Agriculture 1.0), mechanization (Agriculture 2.0), industrialization (Agriculture
    3.0), and precision agriculture (Agriculture 4.0), but introduces novel concepts
    and techniques to address the challenges of modern food production. Fig. 1 shows
    the evolution of agriculture since its beginnings. Agriculture 1.0: This stage
    refers to traditional agriculture or subsistence agriculture, dating back to the
    origins of civilization. Agriculture 1.0 was characterized by the use of hand
    tools and the reliance on human and animal labor. It is generally considered to
    have spanned about 10,000 BC to the 18th century AD. Agriculture 2.0: This stage
    began with the Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century, which marked the beginning
    of agricultural mechanization. The introduction of machines, such as the animal-drawn
    plow and the first combine harvesters, increased productivity and made it possible
    to cultivate large areas of land. Agriculture 2.0 lasted from the 18th century
    to about the middle of the 20th century. Agriculture 3.0: Industrialized agriculture
    or Green Revolution, which developed from the mid-20th century onward. It was
    characterized by the massive application of technology, such as the use of synthetic
    fertilizers, pesticides, advanced agricultural machinery, and intensive farming
    techniques. Agriculture 3.0 spread from the mid-20th century to the end of the
    twentieth century, although some of its practices are still in use today. Agriculture
    4.0: Also known as precision agriculture, this stage refers to the application
    of information and communication technologies (ICT) in agriculture. It includes
    the use of sensors, drones, geographic information systems (GIS), the Internet
    of Things (IoT), and data analytics to optimize agricultural production and reduce
    environmental impact. Agriculture 4.0 began to gain momentum in the late twentieth
    century and continues to do so today. Agriculture 5.0: Termed Digital Agriculture
    [11], this stage is considered the agriculture of the future, driven by emerging
    technologies powered by the Internet of Things, such as artificial intelligence
    (AI), machine learning, robotics, and biotechnology. Agriculture 5.0 focuses on
    sustainability, efficiency, and integration of agricultural systems with the environment
    and society. Although there is no precise date for the start of Agriculture 5.0,
    its development is expected to extend over the next decades and beyond. At its
    core, Agriculture 5.0 leverages emerging technologies to optimize agricultural
    processes, increase productivity, enhance sustainability, and improve resource
    management. These technologies include: Download : Download high-res image (581KB)

    agriculture 5.0. • Internet of Things (IoT): IoT devices, such as sensors and
    actuators, are deployed in agricultural systems to collect real-time data on various
    parameters, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop growth. These
    devices enable continuous monitoring of farming conditions and provide valuable
    information for decision making. • Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
    (ML): AI and ML algorithms are used to analyze the vast amount of data generated
    by IoT devices. These algorithms can identify patterns, make predictions, and
    provide recommendations to optimize crop management, disease detection, pest control,
    and irrigation strategies. AI-powered systems can also automate tasks, such as
    harvesting, sorting, and packaging, leading to greater efficiency and reduced
    labor requirements. • Robotics and Automation: Agricultural robots are designed
    to perform specific tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention. These
    robots can perform activities such as precision planting, weeding, spraying, and
    harvesting, thus improving accuracy, reducing the need for manual labor, and improving
    operational efficiency. • Big Data Analytics: Agriculture 5.0 utilizes big data
    analytics techniques to process and analyze large volumes of data collected from
    a variety of sources. By integrating data from sensors, satellite imagery, weather
    forecasts, and historical records, farmers and agronomists can gain valuable insights
    into crop growth, soil conditions, pest infestations, and other factors that influence
    agricultural productivity. • Cloud and Edge Computing: Cloud computing platforms
    provide the storage and computational power necessary to handle and process vast
    amounts of agricultural data. This technology allows farmers, researchers, and
    stakeholders to access and share information from anywhere, allowing collaborative
    decision-making and facilitating the adoption of precision agriculture practices.
    Due to connectivity limitations in agricultural scenarios, bringing computing
    capabilities closer to the edge is one of the current challenges. The key objective
    of Agriculture 5.0 is to transform traditional farming into a data-driven, knowledge-based
    system. By harnessing the power of advanced technologies and data analytics, it
    aims to optimize resource allocation, minimize environmental impacts, and improve
    the overall efficiency and sustainability of agricultural operations. Furthermore,
    Agriculture 5.0 promotes the concept of “farming-as-a-service”, where farmers
    can access agricultural expertise, data-driven insights, and customized solutions
    through platforms and service providers. This approach allows small-scale farmers
    to benefit from advanced technologies and expert knowledge, leveling the playing
    field, and fostering inclusivity in the agricultural sector. In summary, Agriculture
    5.0 represents a paradigm shift in agriculture, where data, technology, and automation
    converge to enable smarter, more efficient, and sustainable farming practices.
    By embracing these innovations, the industry can meet the challenges of food security,
    environmental stewardship, and economic viability in an increasingly complex and
    interconnected world. 2.1. Ethical, environmental, social, economic, and policy
    implications in agriculture 5.0 The adoption of Spatio-Temporal Semantic Data
    Management Systems in the context of Agriculture 5.0 entails important ethical,
    environmental, economic, policy, and social considerations. This subsection addresses
    these critical aspects, highlighting their relevance in the framework of the implementation
    of advanced IoT technologies in the agricultural domain. 2.1.1. Ethical implications
    Mass data collection in modern agriculture raises ethical questions about privacy
    and informed consent of farmers and other stakeholders. In addition, autonomous
    decision making of data-driven systems could generate ethical dilemmas, requiring
    careful reflection on responsibility and transparency in the automated decision
    chain. The book “Farm data management, sharing and services for agriculture development”
    [12] analyzes the ethical implications of data management in agriculture and highlights
    the fundamental principles that should guide ethical practices in this context.
    2.1.2. Environmental implications The extensive use of IoT technologies in agriculture
    can have a significant environmental impact, from energy resource consumption
    to e-waste generation. It is crucial to assess how the implementation of these
    technologies contributes to or counteracts the environmental sustainability goals
    in the agricultural sector. The European Commission’s report “A Sustainable Bioeconomy
    for Europe: Strengthening the Connection Between Economy, Society, and the Environment.”
    [13] provides a comprehensive overview of sustainability in the bioeconomy, offering
    relevant insights to understand the environmental impact of advanced agricultural
    technologies. 2.1.3. Social implications Automation and digitalization can have
    an impact on traditional agricultural employment, posing socio-economic challenges
    in rural communities. Social aspects must be carefully addressed to ensure a fair
    transition to Agriculture 5.0, considering the impact on employability and equity
    in access to these technologies. Sarah Rotz et al. examine the social implications
    of agricultural digitalization with a focus on the North American context [14].
    This paper highlights key tensions related to automation, duality in the labor
    market, and digital data control. As conclusions to the current paradigm, it argues
    for a social justice perspective, calling for a review of policies to mitigate
    exploitation and marginalization. 2.1.4. Economic and policy implications For
    the proper development of STSDMSs and their integration into modern agriculture,
    it is important to consider that the implementation of advanced technologies and
    the digitization of agriculture also have economic and political implications
    to be taken into account. In [15], the policy implications for the deepening of
    agricultural informatization and the accelerated construction of modern agricultural
    and rural areas are addressed. In addition, the authors systematically analyze
    the theory of regional rural economic growth under Big Data as a whole, and the
    theory of the relationship between agricultural and rural big data development
    and rural economic growth, which forms the theoretical basis of the study. Access,
    sharing, and use of agricultural data is a major concern for farmers in Agriculture
    5.0. To address this, it should be explored whether or how existing policy frameworks
    and other sectoral initiatives can help foster greater trust. In [16], concerns
    about regulatory differences in data policies between countries and limitations
    to cross-border data flows in agriculture are discussed. Integrating these ethical,
    environmental, economic, policy, and social considerations into the implementation
    of STSDMSs is essential to ensure a sustainable and ethical development of Agriculture
    5.0, aligned with the values and objectives of society and relevant European policies.
    2.2. Spatio-temporal data management in agriculture 5.0 From its origins, agricultural
    activity has been based on observation and annotation to correctly manage crops
    and livestock. Field conditions, climatic and environmental conditions, and even
    the specific needs of the different crops or livestock have been studied. Just
    as human decisions, actions, and learning are based on data collection through
    our different senses, the digitization of agriculture is based on the same principle.
    Through raw data and information, provided by a wide variety of devices and sources,
    the knowledge needed to perform a particular action or recommendation is extracted.
    In addition, the processing and analysis of historical data will ultimately provide
    the learning and wisdom needed to increase the performance and efficiency of agricultural
    activity. This principle is represented by the DIKW Pyramid (see Fig. 2). Agriculture
    5.0 or digital agriculture is based on the collection of data from various sources.
    These data can be characterized according to the nature of the sources that generate
    them: (i) Sensors and devices deployed in the field, (ii) weather stations, (iii)
    autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, and (iv) collars on cattle. Download

    Knowledge extraction process in agriculture. DIKW Pyramid (Data, Information,
    Knowledge, Wisdom Pyramid). Each of these sources generates raw data from which,
    after management and processing, the necessary knowledge is extracted to feed
    decision support solutions, task automation, and monitoring. According to this
    approach, it is clear that Agriculture 5.0 arises mainly from the implementation
    of well-known sensor networks and the Internet of Things. However, agricultural
    scenarios present very specific characteristics that are not found in other application
    domains, such as smart cities, smart homes, Industry 4.0, or the use of IoT in
    healthcare, such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The main challenges
    facing Agriculture 5.0 can be summarized in three main factors: • Connectivity
    problems and instability • Low-resource devices • Lack of semantic interoperability
    due to the absence of standards in agricultural data models Agricultural digitization
    is driven by the extraction of knowledge or wisdom from raw data sources (sensors
    and devices) deployed in the field. Appropriate data processing and management
    must be performed to extract knowledge from the raw data provided by the sensors
    [17]. The data captured by the different types of sensors and devices must provide
    answers to the following questions. Where were the data taken? When were the data
    taken? What is the meaning of the data? This is due to the spatio-temporal semantic
    nature of the data generated by the different sensors and devices in agriculture.
    Although STSDMSs are essential for the implementation of Agriculture 5.0 and the
    Internet of Things in general, their use and performance are limited by some critical
    problems (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (177KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Critical issues on STSDMSs. • Access to query or exploit
    data through STSDMSs is very limited for farmers. The graphical interfaces of
    the STSDMSs are oriented towards technical documentation and require specific
    knowledge of database management languages. • The developers of STSDMSs have focused
    on cloud-centric architectures. This provides the computational capabilities for
    managing a large volume of spatio-temporal data but does not solve the connectivity
    problems in agricultural scenarios. The absence of distributed architectures between
    the edge and the cloud makes real-time management impossible. • The lack of interoperability
    between agricultural data models and the absence of standards results in the development
    of native STSDMSs for each scenario. Integration with other solutions or implementation
    in existing platforms is impossible due to the lack of interoperability. • The
    functionalities of current STSDMSs are limited and focus on one of the spatial,
    temporal, or semantic dimensions depending on their design. STSDMSs prioritize
    data management in one of the three dimensions, reducing their performance in
    queries or operations that prioritize the other dimensions. Based on the requirements
    and nature of the data in Agriculture 5.0, eleven spatio-temporal semantic data
    management systems have been selected. This paper aims to review these Spatio-Temporal
    Semantic Data Management Systems (STSDMSs) for Agriculture 5.0 and to identify
    the future challenges using a systematic literature review technique [18] whose
    methodology consists of the following five steps. • Defining a question: What
    are the requirements of Agriculture 5.0 in terms of managing the spatio-temporal
    semantic data generated? (presented in Section 2) • Search for literature: Eleven
    STSDMSs have been selected from the literature and current projects according
    to the needs outlined in Agriculture 5.0. In addition, some approaches designed
    for other application domains with the potential to meet the needs and adapt to
    the Agriculture 5.0 domain have been selected. (presented in Section 3) • Extracting
    information from selected works: Each STSDMS is presented and analyzed, respectively,
    in a systematic format. (presented in Section 3) • Assessing the quality of selected
    works: An evaluation of the selected STSDMSs is carried out in terms of interoperability,
    scalability, accessibility, real-time performance, etc. (presented in Section
    4) • Conclusion statement: Current challenges are detected and future research
    directions to solve them are presented (Section 4.2). In addition, a proposal
    is presented to address the needs outlined in Agriculture 5.0. (presented in Section
    5) 3. Literature review on selected spatio-temporal semantic data management systems
    The first and most characteristic phase of the implementation of IoT in agriculture
    arises from the collection of data by the devices deployed in the action scenarios.
    For this reason, the correct characterization of the data and the subsequent development
    of systems capable of managing them are critical for the posterior processing
    and development of solutions. The data captured by agricultural devices provide
    information on three dimensions: (i) Spatial, (ii) Temporal, and (iii) Semantic
    [19]. This type of information description is provided by semantic models of linked
    data [20]. The current literature presents numerous surveys and reviews that analyze
    a variety of data management systems for agriculture. Notable among them are reviews
    on crop data management [21], reviews on agricultural information management systems
    [22], [23] or reviews on remote sensing [24] and IoT implementation in modern
    agriculture [25]. These studies provide a review of systems and technologies capable
    of managing agricultural source data, but do not focus on data management of a
    spatio-temporal semantic nature, which is necessary to enable Agriculture 5.0
    scenarios. STSDMSs are indispensable in the current agricultural paradigm, in
    which various static and moving devices share the sensing information of agricultural
    scenarios. For this reason, this article takes a novel and specific approach,
    offering a review of the literature on STSDMSs for Agriculture 5.0. The purpose
    of this article is to review the current literature on the STSDMSs required for
    the achievement of Agriculture 5.0. The implementation of STSDMSs in agriculture
    is a novel approach that reflects the needs exposed by the integration of advanced
    technologies and IoT in modern agriculture. For this reason, in the current literature,
    there are still few systems capable of providing data management focused on the
    spatio-temporal semantic nature of the data generated by devices and agents deployed
    in the field. To provide a representative assessment of the current literature
    on STSDMSs in Agriculture 5.0, systems that have not been developed for this purpose
    have been discarded. Examples of discarded systems include: (i) FarmLogic/FarmPAD
    [26] and Connected Farm Field [27] because of their limitations in handling data
    from agricultural devices and sensors; (ii) Farmbrite [28] and Farmplan (Gatekeeper)
    [29] as these systems have been developed for business management, planning and
    annotation of tasks, events or reminders, they do not support the management of
    data from IoT devices on the farm; (iii) FarmCommand [30] as these are closed
    solutions, offering data management only for company-specific hardware and sensors;
    and (iii) FarmLeap [31] as it is focused on technical analysis, economic simulation,
    and environmental diagnostics. This section presents the eleven Spatio-Temporal
    Semantic Data Management Systems selected from the current literature, as explained
    in Section 2.2. 3.1. FIS and FMIS Data generated by agricultural devices are linked
    to the use of geographic information systems (GIS). GIS platforms and systems
    include tools for the storage, analysis, manipulation, and mapping of any kind
    of georeferenced information. Due to the relevance of spatial information in precision
    agriculture, a specific GIS system was developed, named Field-Level Geographic
    Information System (FIS) [32]. However, this system was developed for older operating
    systems such as Windows 3.1x, 95, and 98. The updated version of FIS is named
    the Farm Management Information System (FMIS). According to Burlacu et al. [33]
    FMIS supports farmers in various areas or activities, from operational planning,
    implementation, and documentation to evaluation of the work done in the field
    during the exercise. However, despite its upgradability, FMIS does not consider
    the time dimension and its adaptation to scenarios requiring real-time action
    or response is very limited. 3.2. GeoFIS To facilitate the process of obtaining
    spatial information and making informed decisions for agricultural management,
    the open-source GeoFIS software was developed. In [34], Corentin Leroux et al.
    evaluate the capabilities of GeoFIS, together with its embedded algorithms, to
    address the needs expressed by farmers and their advisors or spatial analysts
    when dealing with agricultural data. Specifically, GeoFIS has been evaluated through
    three case studies, including different types of crops and the ability of the
    algorithms embedded in the software to meet the needs expressed by farmers. The
    main limitation exposed by GeoFIS arises from its own specialized implementation
    in the spatial dimension or georeference of the data. It offers a certain limitation
    in the management of temporal and semantic information provided by agricultural
    data in agricultural digitization scenarios. 3.3. JD Urban Spatio-Temporal data
    engine (JUST) Due to the increasing generation of geo-positioning tagged data,
    a large volume of spatio-temporal data is currently generated in the IoT application
    domains. Current solutions need to adapt to the new paradigm where diverse devices
    generate large amounts of spatio-temporal data, requiring an efficient, scalable,
    and adaptive spatio-temporal data management system. Some of the systems developed
    to date have been focused on different application domains, using Big Data techniques
    for the correct management of the growing volumes of data. However, due to the
    nature of the sensed data, their adaptability to new domains lies in the integration
    or upgrade to new data models. JD Urban Spatio-Temporal data engine (JUST), presented
    by Ruiyuan Li et al. [35] in its version 1.1.0, offers an urban spatio-temporal
    data engine. JUST has been designed for the management of large volumes of spatial
    and temporal data, incorporating a distributed NoSQL data warehouse as underlying
    storage and GeoMesa [36] as indexing tool, together with Apache Spark [37] as
    execution engine. The main contributions put forward by the JUST system include:
    • Design and implementation of JUST as a holistic distributed system for the efficient
    management of large volumes of spatio-temporal data. • Two new indexing techniques,
    Z2T and XZ2T, to speed up spatio-temporal data gathering or querying. In addition,
    a compression mechanism applied to fields with large bytes is introduced, using
    the gzip or zip compression method to reduce storage costs and improve query efficiency.
    • A complete SQL engine is implemented to provide an SQL-like query language,
    called JustQL, which simplifies data query operations. The implemented SQL engine
    includes predefined operations, among which three types of spatio-temporal query
    operations are highlighted: (i) spatial range queries, (ii) spatio-temporal range
    queries, and (iii) k-NN (Nearest Neighbor) queries for point-based records. •
    JUST is designed to be deployed as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). The paper presents
    the evaluation of the JUST system against two real datasets and one synthetic
    dataset. Datasets include: (i) Traj, which contains the trajectories of more than
    48,000 JD Logistics trucks. (ii) Order, which includes orders or purchases from
    JD Mall. This dataset contains the time stamp of the order and the delivery address
    or geoposition. (iii) Synthetic, generated from the Traj dataset, up to 1 TB of
    data, to evaluate the scalability of JUST. The main problem exposed by the JUST
    system to meet the needs of digital agriculture or agriculture 5.0 scenarios lies
    in its specific design for urban spatio-temporal data. For its adaptation to the
    Agriculture 5.0 domain, the system must be adapted to work with data models focused
    on sensor networks or specific to agriculture. Additionally, due to the inherent
    connectivity limitations of agricultural scenarios, computational capacity needs
    to be brought closer to the edge or the architecture needs to be redesigned to
    distribute it between the edge and the cloud. 3.4. SEMAP The development of spatio-temporal
    data management systems to enable agricultural digitization has a long way to
    go in terms of research and improvement. Due to the increasing integration of
    agricultural devices and machinery into sensor and data management systems for
    process automation and monitoring, there is a large research effort in the literature
    to develop new data management systems or to adapt existing systems from other
    application domains. Semantic Environment Mapping Framework (SEMAP), presented
    by Henning Deeken et al. [38], provides a framework for spatial data storage and
    analysis capable of performing spatial reasoning on a multimodal environment model.
    This system was designed for the spatio-semantic management of robotic planning.
    However, in 2018 [39] and 2019 [40], the SEMAP framework was successfully applied
    in the domain of digitization of agricultural processes. The application of the
    SEMAP framework in agriculture offers an innovative approach through the management
    of relationships between the agricultural machinery involved in a given scenario
    (M2M), as well as the communication and machine-environment relationships. SEMAP
    is agnostic in terms of robot control architectures; however, it implements a
    Robot Operating System (ROS) interface, which provides services for the insertion,
    modification, or deletion of the contents of the environment model. The objective
    of SEMAP is to provide information about objects, with their geometric representations,
    and the environment, allowing spatial analysis and semantic inference. The data
    management architecture presented by SEMAP arises from the clear differentiation
    between semantic and spatial information. To manage the structure of spatial and
    semantic information, SEMAP has two dedicated databases for each dimension (see
    Fig. 4). A knowledge base (KB), maintained with Apache JENA and whose data are
    represented in Web Ontology Language (OWL) [41] and a spatial database, implemented
    as an extension of PostGIS. To ensure performance optimization in terms of data
    storage and gathering, both query systems are combined to support queries that
    contain semantic and spatial aspects, such as “Are there any devices in this crop
    field?”. For the semantic representation of agricultural concepts, the SEMAP knowledge
    base has been adapted through the ontology called AgriCo. The AgriCo ontology
    enables the description of concepts such as crop fields, farms, and agricultural
    machinery itself. This ontology has been developed in-house, as part of the adaptation
    of SEMAP to the precision agriculture domain. AgriCo is based on the LogiCo logistic
    core ontology, exposed by Daniele et al. [42]. Download : Download high-res image

    for the combination of semantic and spatial information. The main limitations
    exposed by SEMAP in agriculture consist of: (i) The absence of management of the
    temporal dimension provided by the data. (ii) Due to the complexity of the 2D
    and 3D description of the spatial dimension of the data, SEMAP requires high computational
    capabilities. (iii) Difficult adaptability to solutions requiring real-time response
    or deployment at the edge, due to the need for high computational capabilities.
    (iv) Due to its adaptability to the agricultural domain through the development
    of AgriCo as the native ontology of the system, it exposes a lack of semantic
    interoperability with other agricultural data models. 3.5. Open spatio-temporal
    data warehouse for agriculture In the last decade, advances in Web 2.0 technology
    have improved the accessibility of data through the cloud, experiencing an increase
    in Linked Open Data, Linked Open Statistical Data, and Open Government Data available
    for sharing. The next frontier, the Web 3.0 or Semantic Web, pursues the development
    of a smarter, more intuitive, and connected web experience through data access
    and information availability. However, the availability and accessibility of data
    for further production analysis in agriculture is currently very limited and rarely
    contains attributes for spatio-temporal analysis. In [43], Irya Wisnumbhadra et
    al. propose the development of a spatio-temporal data warehouse designed to analyze
    agricultural production through open data sources. The warehouse consists of several
    open data sources from the agricultural module of the Village and Rural Area Information
    System (SIDeKA). The objective of the data warehouse is to offer a service-oriented
    architecture through expressive performance that helps executives in making decisions
    on agricultural production analysis based on spatio-temporal data. The data warehouse
    has been developed using MobilityDB, an extension of PostGreSQL DBMS [44], and
    PostGIS. The system provides query operations for agricultural production analysis
    using a mobility query function to summarize, drill down, segment, split, and
    aggregate spatial and temporal data, with an average execution time of less than
    one second. The openness of the data source with the 5-star index provides the
    opportunity to link and extend the data source with the big data catalog of the
    Internet and the inference capability of the semantic web. 3.6. Integrated spatio-temporal
    system for agriculture Decision support in agriculture is limited by spatio-temporal
    data management systems and the spatio-temporal knowledge extracted from their
    processing. In [45], N.A. Lorentzos et al. propose an integrated spatio-temporal
    system for managing time-varying data and knowledge. The system integrates a time
    series oriented database (TSDB), a rule-based expert system (ES), and a geographic
    information system (GIS) to enable spatio-temporal data and knowledge management
    in agriculture. The architecture of the integrated spatio-temporal system presented
    by N.A. Lorentzos et al. is depicted in Fig. 5. It consists of two loosely coupled
    main components, DK (Data and Knowledge) and S (Spatial data). The DK component
    integrates two subcomponents, the ES shell and the TDBMS (Temporal DataBase Management
    System). The TDBMS is subordinate to the ES shell. Moreover, the S component is
    made up only of a GIS. This system has been applied and validated in agriculture
    and related areas. Some of the applications of the system include: Download :

    of the integrated spatio-temporal system proposed by N.A. Lorentzos et al. • Soil
    sustainability and soil evaluation. • Time-varying land uses. • Beekeeping. •
    Redistribution of cultivated land. • Earthquake prediction. The Integrated spatio-temporal
    system provides one of the first integrations of temporal and spatial dimensions
    in data management systems for agriculture. 3.7. mySense data management architecture
    The mySense environment, proposed by Raul Morais et al. in [46], offers an open
    source solution for precision agriculture (PA) and precision viticulture (PV)
    monitoring applications. The data management architecture developed in the mySense
    environment offers a novel approach capable of optimizing the agricultural data
    management process, thanks to a distributed repository between relational and
    non-relational databases. This approach makes it possible to distribute the data
    injection and storage process according to the nature, volume, and dynamism of
    the data in one or the other database. The data management architecture exposed
    in the mySense environment consists of a distributed, multi-tier layered architecture.
    This architecture is composed of two databases (MySQL and MongoDB) wrapped by
    a software management layer capable of coordinating and processing the acquired
    data. The mySense data management architecture provides a RESTful API that interacts
    with the structured database (MySQL) to store high latency and low volume data,
    such as sensor and platform user information. The unstructured database (MongoDB)
    is used to handle the voluminous and dynamic nature of the heterogeneous data
    generated by sensors. In addition, time-based agents such as Data Slider, Objects
    Reporter, and Data Account Manager optimize data storage and accessibility. Data
    management functions are implemented in the Data Manipulation Manager (DMM) interface.
    The functions offered by the DMM interface include preliminary filtering of data
    sets by date range to improve efficiency across the time dimension. The mySense
    environment provides a data visualization interface geared towards a simple user
    experience, to visualize the data sent by each device or sensor deployed. 3.8.
    Agri-IoT Different application domains such as smart cities and healthcare have
    seen major advances in the research and development of frameworks and platforms
    to manage smart applications over sensor networks and IoT. The development of
    agricultural frameworks or platforms has benefited from previous research and
    advances in similar domains, with similar requirements, such as smart cities.
    Based on the different approaches presented in the literature, the Agri-IoT semantic
    framework [47] offers an application-oriented platform for smart farming applications,
    capable of managing and reasoning about heterogeneous data captured by agricultural
    devices. The Agri-IoT framework uses semantic annotation of data for sensor/data
    flow discovery and subsequent real-time adaptive reasoning. The semantic annotation
    of Agri-IoT is based on lightweight information models developed from ontologies
    designed for sensor networks such as SSN [48] and OWL-S [49] or agricultural models
    such as AGROVOC [50], AgOnt [51], and the Agricultural Ontology Service (AOS)
    [52]. The validation of the Agri-IoT framework shows how the triple-store or knowledge
    database oriented data management architecture offers very limited capabilities
    in data query or exploitation scenarios. Validation consists of the excitation
    of the system against continuous query execution with RDF stream processing techniques
    such as CSPARQL. [53] and CQELS [54] (queries with SPARQL syntax). However, the
    results show high latencies, memory and process consumption in scenarios with
    a limited number of sensors and a low complexity of queries executed. From 700
    sensors onward, queries are delayed by more than 10 s, even experiencing delays
    of up to minutes. 3.9. AFarCloud AFarCloud (Aggregate FARming in the CLOUD) is
    the result of an ECSEL JU project [55], [56] in which a distributed platform is
    developed that enables the integration and cooperation of cyber–physical systems
    in real time. The aim of the platform is to increase efficiency, productivity,
    animal health, feed quality, and reduce farm labor costs through monitoring, analysis,
    task automation, and decision support. To reduce processing times, enable agile
    repository management, and ensure real-time execution, the AFarCloud data model
    is based on a lightweight JSON syntax, with strong temporal and spatial characterization
    of the data. The data management architecture and repositories are distributed
    between time series-oriented databases (TSDBs) for historical observations, and
    relational databases for the registration and management of the latest measurements
    captured by each deployed agent. These types of architectures offer very short
    query and data injection times. The AFarCloud data model mainly comprises three
    distinct data sets: 1. Observations generated by devices (sensors and actuators)
    deployed in the field. 2. Measurements captured by sensors embedded in collars
    fitted to the cattle’s necks. 3. State Vectors (SVs) of autonomous or semi-autonomous
    vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The collection of schemas defining
    the semantic spatio-temporal data model developed in the AFarCloud platform is
    collected in [57]. The main shortcoming detected in the data management system
    implemented in the AFarCloud platform lies in the reasoning and processing of
    relationships and semantic information. The components in charge are decoupled
    from the repository itself. However, the agile data collection through the temporal
    and spatial dimension offered by the STSDMS, allows for a reduced response time
    in the processing and aggregation of semantic information through decoupled components.

    Horizon 2020 DEMETER (Building an Interoperable, Data-Driven, Innovative, and
    Sustainable European Agri-Food Sector) [58], [59] aims to digitally transform
    the European agri-food sector by adopting IoT technologies, data science, and
    precision farming technologies to promote long-term sustainability. The aim of
    the project is to equip farmers and cooperatives with the ability to extract knowledge
    from their existing machinery and platforms, improving the decision-making process.
    The data management system implemented in the DEMETER architecture focuses on
    the management of the relationships and semantic descriptions captured by the
    devices and agents participating in the platform. To ensure a powerful semantic
    characterization of the data, DEMETER develops the Agricultural Information Model
    (AIM) [60]. To provide semantic interoperability with other agricultural data
    models, the platform includes enabling components capable of translating the data
    obtained by queries and injections into the repositories. The interest in the
    DEMETER smart platform is especially driven by the European data strategy [61],
    which aims to make Europe a leader in the data society. Due to the strong semantic
    characterization of the data modeled under AIM, applications requiring real-time
    or time-series oriented management or geopositioning tags offer high response
    times. However, through translation-enabling components, the repositories implemented
    in the AFarCloud platform 3.9 have been integrated into the DEMETER architecture.
    This provides an ideal symbiosis for the different needs of the applications and
    solutions developed in Agriculture 5.0. 4. Evaluation, upcoming challenges and
    future directions After presenting the selected spatio-temporal semantic data
    management systems for agriculture, we will evaluate each of them against eight
    aspects including accessibility, interoperability, real-time operation capability,
    etc. According to the results of the evaluation, Section 4.2 identifies future
    challenges and research lines in the development of STSDMSs for agriculture 5.0.
    Finally, a proposal capable of accommodating the needs and challenges detected
    after the evaluation of the selected STSDMS is presented, based on a horizontally
    and vertically distributed architecture (see Section 5). 4.1. Evaluation of selected
    STSDMSs Table 1, Table 2 show the evaluation results of the selected STSDMSs.
    For each of the aspects under evaluation: (i) If the aspect was fully considered
    and evaluated, with descriptions and technical details, it gets three stars (best);
    (ii) If the aspect is partially mentioned or no specific evaluation results are
    provided, it gets two stars (medium); (iii) If the aspect is not considered, it
    gets one star (worst). Regarding the aspect that evaluates whether the system
    operates on spatial, temporal, and/or semantic dimensions, a score of one, two,
    or three stars is attributed according to the number of dimensions considered.
    For example, the SEMAP system only considers the spatial and semantic dimensions
    of the data for its management, so it obtains two stars in this aspect. When an
    aspect obtains a higher total number of stars, it indicates that it has been thoroughly
    evaluated and considered in the implementation of the systems presented in the
    literature. The aspects that have obtained a lower score represent a potential
    future challenge in the design and implementation of STSDMSs in agriculture 5.0,
    and should therefore be considered with special attention in future research lines.
    The evaluation criteria have been selected from the Software Quality Requirements
    and Evaluation (SQuaRE) standard, including accessibility, interoperability, scalability,
    and functionality completeness (ISO/IEC 25010:2011, BSI Standards Publication,
    https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html). Table 3 summarizes the results obtained
    for each of the evaluated systems. The resulting average evaluation of all selected
    STSDMSs archives 15.09 stars (62.88%). The results indicate that the development
    and research on spatio-temporal semantic data management systems still have a
    long way to go to meet the needs outlined in Agriculture 5.0. The best of the
    STSDMSs selected is the AFarCloud system, which addresses most of the evaluation
    aspects. In contrast, the FIS system is ranked last with a total of 11 stars out
    of 24, due to inadequate consideration of accessibility, interoperability, real-time
    operation capability, etc. Table 3. Overall remarks of selected STSDMSs. STSDMS

    Accessibility This aspect mainly refers to the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    of an STSDMS [10], which facilitates the description and use of the query and
    data injection services in the system. The GUI is a necessary component for providers
    of devices, services, components, clients, and users who wish to consume or inject
    data into the system. Decision support systems, automation systems, vehicle or
    robot mission managers, and monitoring or tracking systems for livestock and deployed
    devices/agents can be integrated into the platform through the documentation and
    functions provided in the STSDMS GUI. The evaluation shows that the development
    of user interfaces is one of the components present in the literature on STSDMSs
    for agricultural digitization. The reason for this is that user interfaces provide
    a layer of abstraction over the internal complexity of data management systems.
    However, there is still a long way to go in this regard, as most of the GUIs presented
    in the systems are complex, oriented towards the technical integration of components,
    making it difficult for the farmer to query the data [62]. This results in the
    need to integrate monitoring or tracking systems for data consultation by the
    end user. As shown in Table 1, accessibility is one of the most considered aspects.
    GeoFIS, SEMAP, mySense, and the STSDMS of DEMETER offer good GUIs for operators,
    enabling their use by farmers and agricultural experts through user-friendly interfaces.
    Good examples of GUIs directly integrated into STSDMSs are presented in Fig. 6.
    Fig. 6(a) shows the user interface developed with Swagger [63] of the spatio-temporal
    data management system of the AFarCloud platform. This type of interface is oriented
    towards the documentation of the system’s query and injection service, enabling
    the integration of services that need to be fed with the data stored in the repositories.
    Fig. 6(b) describes the user interface of the mySense query and data management
    system. This interface enables end-user interaction, reducing the complexity of
    the raw query functions. Download : Download high-res image (739KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of selected GUIs. 4.1.2. Scalability
    Scalability represents the ability of an STSDMS to process, store, and manage
    increasing amounts of data, queries, and injection requests [64], [65]. The scalability
    of an STSDMS thus indicates the ability to integrate new devices and services
    into the platform, and even the ability to manage information from more scenarios,
    farms, or crops. The STSDMSs developed for the AFarCloud and DEMETER smart platforms
    stand out for their scalability through the management of the growing volume of
    data from various agricultural scenarios all over Europe, populated by a multitude
    of sensors and devices. As shown in Table 1, the scalability of STSDMSs still
    has a long way to go in terms of research and improvement. This is mainly due
    to systems whose repositories are purely knowledge base oriented or triple-store
    oriented. Due to the complexity and volume of semantic descriptions and relationships
    between agents and properties, the scalability of these systems is very limited.
    One of the main approaches to overcome this problem is the division between the
    semantic description of entities, stored in a dedicated knowledge base (triple-store)
    and the storage of time series or observations in a time series oriented database.
    4.1.3. Interoperability Interoperability focuses on the ability to integrate services
    and manage data from heterogeneous agents and components. Interoperability is
    one of the most important features in STSDMSs due to the need to capture and manage
    data generated by multiple sources and devices deployed in the scenarios of action;
    as well as the ability to interact with other components and solutions for visualization,
    analysis, decision support, etc. By definition, an STSDMS acts as middleware for
    the agricultural IoT platform for which it has been designed (see Fig. 7). The
    ISO/IEC 21823-1:2019 [66] standard defines five levels of interoperability for
    IoT systems: Download : Download high-res image (239KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Spatio-Temporal Semantic Data Management System (STSDMS) as semantic
    middleware for agriculture 5.0. • Transport interoperability involves establishing
    a communication infrastructure to exchange data over different transport protocols
    or networks without loss or corruption of data. It also manages data quality of
    service (QoS) requirements, such as delivery, timeliness, ordering, durability,
    lifespan, and fault tolerance. • Syntactic Interoperability is the ability of
    different IoT systems to exchange data using a common data format or syntax. This
    ensures that the data are correctly interpreted and processed by the receiving
    system, without ensuring that the meaning of the information is correctly understood.
    • Semantic Interoperability aims to ensure that all entities attribute the same
    meaning to the information exchanged by using metadata and shared information
    models (ontologies). • Behavioral Interoperability aligns and integrates business
    processes to achieve the expected result of information exchange. • Legal or Policy
    Interoperability ensures that organizations operating under different legal frameworks,
    policies, and strategies can exchange information and collaborate effectively.
    This includes issues such as data privacy, security, and ownership, as well as
    compliance with industry standards and regulations. The Semantic Interoperability
    level is particularly important in the design and implementation of an STSDMS.
    The absence of standards in data models for agriculture and agricultural devices
    makes the acquisition of semantic and syntactic interoperability difficult. The
    absence of interoperability results in the generation of data silos and exposes
    the need to implement gateways or specific translator components to enable the
    integration of services. As shown in Table 1, interoperability is still one of
    the main challenges for the achievement of Agriculture 5.0. The DEMETER STSDMS
    is the only system for which interoperability capabilities have been included
    in its design. 4.1.4. Real-time operation The ability of an STSDMS to deliver
    real-time performance lies in the ability to deliver the information captured
    by the devices and agents deployed in the field without delays induced by batch
    storage or additional processing [67]. This aspect is related to the ability to
    scale the system and respond to query requests made by users or integrated components
    [68]. There are three main approaches to achieve real-time operation or to reduce
    the delay times between data injection and the system’s ability to deliver those
    data as a response in its query interface: • Edge processing: Distribute the STSDMS
    architecture between the cloud and the edge according to the processing capabilities
    required. The latest measurements or data captured by the deployed devices will
    also be stored at the edge, so that they can be automatically queried by actuators
    or services that require real-time action. • Dedicated database: By including
    a relational database solely dedicated to storing the latest time series generated
    by each device, sensor, or agent deployed, the rapid extraction of the latest
    measurements or current status is enabled. This database has to keep a very small
    size, eliminating semantic complexity and historical data storage. • Lightweight
    data model and ontology: By implementing an STSDMS based on a data model with
    lightweight syntax (such as JSON) and reduced semantic complexity, processing
    and repository management delays will be reduced. However, other factors, such
    as the heterogeneity of the data generated by different devices and the increasing
    volume of stored data, will affect the performance of the system, increasing query
    delays. Additionally, the complexity of query operations will affect response
    times, due to the delays introduced by the planning of the data distribution operation.
    Table 1 shows how the selected STSDMSs exhibit a lower real-time operation capacity
    as the semantic complexity of the data description increases. The AFarCloud STSDMS
    provides a good example of a design oriented to real-time operation capability.
    Current agricultural proposals still have a long way to go in terms of research
    to match the needs and capacity for real-time operation. 4.1.5. Big spatio-temporal
    data management This aspect describes the ability of the system to operate with
    a large number of injections and queries of spatio-temporal nature, in a repository
    with a large volume of spatio-temporal data [69]. As discussed in aspect Scalability,
    an STSDMS must cope with the increasing volume of requests and data stored by
    the system. However, this aspect evaluates whether the system has been validated
    or stressed by the high demand of requests against a repository with a high volume
    of spatio-temporal data. Due to the seasonality of the data captured by weather
    stations or sensors deployed in crops, Agriculture 5.0 offers an optimal scenario
    for the study of historical and seasonal data. The large number of devices and
    sensors deployed in agricultural scenarios results in a high volume of data that
    must be stored in repositories. Similarly, spatio-temporal queries that aim to
    extract or post-process historical data for knowledge extraction are subject to
    the exploitation of highly populated repositories. In this aspect, the response
    capacity of the selected STSDMSs to spatio-temporal historical queries without
    blocking the service has been reviewed. 4.1.6. Agricultural application (adaptability)
    Several STSDMSs designed for specific application domains other than agriculture
    5.0 are described in the current literature. Some domains such as smart cities
    or Industry 4.0 present scenarios with needs equivalent to those of agricultural
    scenarios. STSDMSs designed and implemented for a specific application domain
    often offer resistance in their adaptation to other domains, mainly due to the
    use of native data models and the implementation of rigid query interfaces. However,
    self-adaptive systems [70] or solutions developed in other domains with characteristics
    similar to agriculture can offer very interesting solutions with low adaptation
    effort. In this article, some systems designed for other application domains have
    been studied, with similar or equivalent characteristics and needs to those exposed
    in Agriculture 5.0. This aspect evaluates whether the system under study was directly
    designed and implemented for the agricultural domain (three stars), or whether
    it can be adapted (one star), due to a less rigid implementation. Finally, if
    the authors present an assessment of its adaptability to the agricultural domain,
    a score of two stars is obtained. The systems presented in this article are at
    least adaptable to the agricultural domain if they were not originally designed
    for this domain. Due to the large research effort in other application domains
    with characteristics similar to the agricultural domain, it is important to select
    some of the most relevant solutions from the literature, such as the JUST and
    SEMAP systems. 4.1.7. Distributed cloud–edge This aspect refers to the distribution
    of the data management architecture in layers, between the edge, the fog, and
    the cloud [71]. Due to the high power and computational resource requirements,
    most data management systems in agriculture offer a centralized architecture in
    the cloud [72]. However, agriculture as an application domain exposes certain
    limitations that cannot be accommodated in centralized systems, mainly due to
    the lack of connectivity in agricultural scenarios, the need for data anonymization,
    and the delays introduced in communications with the cloud. To enable task automation
    and adaptability to the aforementioned constraints, data management systems favor
    distributed architectures capable of hosting different functionalities and responsibilities
    in layers. As shown in Table 2, the distribution of agricultural data management
    systems still exposes a wide avenue for research and development. None of the
    selected systems has hosted such distributed architectures in their design. 4.1.8.
    Spatial, temporal and semantic dimensions This aspect describes the number of
    dimensions considered by the STSDMS for agriculture under analysis. The data generated
    by the devices and sensors deployed in agricultural scenarios provide information
    on all three dimensions, due to the spatio-temporal-semantic nature of the agricultural
    environment [73]: (i) Geopositioning, where the data were captured; (ii) Timestamp,
    when the data were generated; (iii) Semantic, meaning of the data or relationships
    with other actors and environment. A system capable of managing information about
    the three dimensions in which any heterogeneous data captured in an agricultural
    scenario are framed is able to provide complete information about the reality
    observed or sensed in the agricultural scenario. However, this information is
    a source of complexity for the management and storage of the data itself, which
    requires a greater optimization effort. A data management system has to be designed
    from a data model that considers the description of the three dimensions to become
    a complete STSDMS. However, the current literature presents systems that focus
    on one or two dimensions, with the aim of reducing the complexity and computational
    requirements for spatial, temporal, and semantic management. As shown in Table
    2, systems initially designed to handle all three dimensions perform better in
    all other aspects. The main challenges identified in the research on STSDMSs to
    accommodate the correct management of the three dimensions are grouped into: (i)
    the design of a data model capable of characterizing the sensed information in
    all three dimensions; (ii) the distribution and cooperation of specialized databases
    within a single repository (Knowledge DB, Time-series DB, SQL DB, etc.); and (iii)
    the optimization of query and injection functions. 4.2. Upcoming challenges Based
    on the summary of the eleven STSDMSs provided in Section 3 and the evaluation
    result in Tables 1, 2, and 3, a number of future challenges are identified. These
    challenges show the development trends and potential improvements of STSDMSs for
    researchers in the future. By overcoming the challenges identified, STSDMSs will
    be able to better serve the achievement of Agriculture 5.0. • Simplifying GUIs
    to improve accessibility to STSDMSs: Most of the selected STSDMSs provide graphical
    interfaces to query and inject data through the system. However, most of the interfaces
    presented are oriented towards the documentation of the operations and functions
    offered by the system, for their integration in agricultural platforms or the
    coupling of solutions. These interfaces are geared towards technical experts,
    making them difficult to use for farmers and professionals in the agricultural
    sector. Farmers are certainly not familiar with the IT skills and repository management
    languages required for the use of STSDMSs. It is suggested to design GUIs as simple
    as possible. Simple, user-friendly, and end-user oriented GUIs offer a very powerful
    tool for farmers. Data visualizations in the form of maps, tables, lists, and
    graphs integrated as GUIs of the STSDMS itself, allow the farmer to know the current
    status and historical evolution of the agricultural scenarios at a glance. Furthermore,
    these interfaces offer a powerful resource for the detection of anomalies and
    the prevention of risk situations, including the farmer or end-user in the loop.
    One of the most novel approaches is to enable the retribution of data through
    natural language queries [74]. After all, to provide an optimal solution for farmers,
    resistance to their integration into existing operations must be reduced or eliminated;
    providing the necessary information for observation and decision-making based
    on precision data captured by the agents deployed in the field. • Definition of
    a standard agriculture data model: Interoperability is one of the main challenges
    in the development of STSDMSs. This problem stems from the lack of semantic interoperability
    induced by the numerous number of native agricultural data models defined to date.
    The absence of standard data models for agriculture increases the heterogeneity
    of data generated by devices and sensors in the agricultural domain. Currently,
    integration of translation systems or gateways in STSDMSs is one of the most widely
    accepted solutions, but it requires a great deal of implementation effort. One
    of the most innovative proposals consists of automating the mapping or translation
    process between agricultural data models [75]. However, the definition of a standard
    data model would reduce the integration effort between solutions developed for
    agriculture. The interest to address the lack of interoperability in the agri-food
    sector is mainly driven by initiatives such as GAIA-X [76]. • Interoperability
    through machine translation: Current STSDMSs offer specific solutions for the
    platforms or projects for which they were designed. The heterogeneity of the data
    and the variety of agricultural data models generate resistance to their adaptability
    to other existing platforms or solutions. To address this problem, STSDMSs must
    integrate new techniques for the development of an interoperable system [77].
    The integration of machine translation components, based on Machine Learning (ML)
    or Neural Networks (NNs) models, can provide the necessary capabilities for automatic
    translation between the input and output data models to the STSDMS [78]. • Distribute
    the STSDMS architecture between the cloud and the edge: In agriculture, there
    are numerous solutions that require real-time action. Some examples include robotic
    livestock monitoring and herding [79], predator howling systems [80], or fire
    detection and mitigation systems [81]. Connectivity issues and delays introduced
    in communication with cloud-centric STSDMSs make it difficult to implement such
    solutions. One of the main concerns raised by farmers is the anonymization of
    the data captured on their farms. Anonymization must be done prior to injection
    into repositories or data centers accessible by potential competitors or cooperatives.
    To avoid these problems, computing, data management, and performance capabilities
    must be brought closer to the edge. To achieve this goal, distributed architectures
    must be defined between the edge, the fog, and the cloud. Delegating to each level
    of the STSDMS architecture the necessary capabilities for historical or current
    data management. • Distribution of repositories in DBs for historical and current
    data: The increasing volume of data stored in repositories managed by an STSDMS
    is directly related to system performance losses. Queries executed on repositories
    populated with a large volume of data require a high use of computational resources,
    slowing the system [82]. However, there is a clear differentiation between the
    use of historical and current data in the system. Historical data are targeted
    for further processing and analysis or even serve to train machine learning or
    AI models. However, current data serves as input for decision-making, monitoring
    of the current crop status, or detection of anomalies, and consequent action.
    For this reason, real-time data query needs are related to the latest data injected
    into the system. Given this clear differentiation, it is recommended to distribute
    the internal STSDMS repositories or databases, offering a database that only hosts
    the latest data captured by each deployed agent and overwrites them when receiving
    new injections. This database will retain a small footprint with the ability to
    provide real-time responses. Due to the lower resource usage, it can be deployed
    on the edge, enabling the system to respond quickly and eliminating communication
    delays. Similarly, databases in charge of historical data management will offer
    a longer response time but will be able to handle the analysis and processing
    of the data, extracting the necessary knowledge to support agricultural tasks.
    • Performing analysis on historical information: Implementing spatio-temporal
    continuous queries on historical data enables the analysis and discovery of knowledge.
    Continuous queries are a tool capable of defining database queries to be executed
    on a scheduled basis. Simple queries such as calculating minimum, maximum, and
    average values for environmental and crop condition parameters enable anomaly
    detection. Due to the seasonality of environmental data provided by weather stations,
    historical information analysis offers a powerful tool for forecasting and prediction
    [83]. Continuous queries provide a tool capable of processing, aggregating, and
    analyzing large amounts of data at runtime. This type of calculation eliminates
    the delays introduced in future STSDMS queries [84]. Furthermore, extraction of
    knowledge from the raw data stored in the repositories is enabled. For this reason,
    the correct planning and design of continuous queries offer a considerable improvement
    in the performance of STSDMSs in terms of historical data retrieval and analysis.
    • Adopting knowledge from agricultural experts: STSDMSs manage data and observations
    generated by sensors and devices deployed in the field. The diversity and complexity
    of agricultural environments make the input of farmers and experts essential to
    improve the information provided. It is suggested to involve farmers in the process,
    allowing them to add annotations and semantic data to correct and complement the
    information collected by field agents [85]. In STSDMSs, an interactive interface
    should be designed to include the knowledge and information provided by experts.
    In this way, when executing a query or monitoring the data of a given scenario,
    annotations or strategies can be reviewed to reduce the possibility of making
    mistakes in the performance of tasks. 5. Future directions To properly adapt to
    the needs and problems in the field of agriculture, distributed data management
    architectures have to be used. This type of architecture distributes data collection,
    analysis, and processing in different layers or tiers. To avoid connectivity problems
    and to enable solutions that require real-time performance, innovation in agricultural
    digitization is based on the distribution of STSDMS architectures in three levels:
    (I) Edge: Due to the limited computational capabilities of equipment and devices
    deployed at the edge, processing and actuation capabilities are traditionally
    derived from the cloud or fog. However, due to connectivity limitations and delays
    introduced in the exchange of information with the cloud in agriculture, it is
    increasingly necessary to bring processing and actuation capabilities closer to
    the edge. The distribution or layering of repositories for data storage, processing,
    and querying at different levels provides real-time performance capabilities.
    (II) Fog: This is the intermediate level between the edge and the cloud. Systems
    deployed in the fog have greater computational capabilities, making them ideal
    for preprocessing data, detecting anomalies, aggregating, or completing the information
    captured by devices, and reducing the number of requests and centralized processing
    in the cloud. One of its most prominent applications in agriculture is aggregating
    and preprocessing data from different crop fields or farms in the same scenario.
    In addition, they offer an ideal resource for data anonymization prior to injection
    into central repositories. (III) Cloud: The cloud is made up of the servers, components,
    services, and main resources of the architecture. Due to its high computational
    capabilities, it is capable of managing algorithms of artificial intelligence,
    machine learning, data processing, and analysis. However, as mentioned above,
    it introduces delays due to the network layer and the large volume of data and
    processes to be managed. An architecture distributed among the three levels provides
    real-time monitoring and action capabilities. It enables the distribution of tasks
    and processes according to their urgency or computational needs. Additionally,
    it reduces the bandwidth and delays introduced by the network to inject and query
    data from the repository of the platform deployed in the cloud. Finally, it allows
    to select or anonymize the data and information that have to be sent to the cloud,
    offering a powerful tool for the management of security solutions. Increasing
    the security, integrity, and ownership of data is a major concern for farmers
    and ranchers. The type and distribution of the architecture used for spatio-temporal
    semantic data management depends on the needs of the scenario. However, a data
    management architecture initially designed under the distributed architecture
    paradigm enables greater adaptability and scalability. Fig. 8 shows a high-level
    diagram of a proposed distributed data management architecture, based on the standards
    of ITU-T Y.3526 [86] and ITU-T Y.3508 [87]. Download : Download high-res image

    for data management. 5.1. Device-to-STSDMS communication In the management of
    spatio-temporal semantic data for Agriculture 5.0, efficient communication between
    edge devices and the edge layer of the STSDMS is crucial to ensure timely data
    collection and transmission. The implementation of communication protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [88], such as Zigbee and WirelessHART, or technologies
    such as LoRa (low range) and its specification LoRaWAN [89], for low-power wide-area
    networks, emerges as a key strategy. These protocols, known for their low energy
    consumption and ability to operate in bandwidth-constrained environments, are
    ideal solutions to overcome connectivity challenges inherent in distributed and
    heterogeneous agricultural environments. Their adoption facilitates effective
    data transmission, enabling seamless integration between peripheral devices and
    the central system. 5.2. Communication between STSDMS layers Seamless communication
    between the various levels of the system, namely, edge, fog, and cloud, is a critical
    component in optimizing spatio-temporal data management. In this context, the
    strategic implementation of technologies such as 5G becomes significantly relevant,
    especially in communications between the layers of the system. 5.2.1. Communication
    between edge and fog layers The use of 5G technology for communication between
    the edge and fog layers of the STSDMS is a wise choice, especially in scenarios
    where edge deployments may span rural areas characterized by limited connectivity.
    The adoption of 5G technology in this context is reinforced by its distinctive
    characteristics, which perfectly match the complex requirements of edge and fog
    communication in agriculture 5.0. High Bandwidth and Data Throughput: 5G offers
    a substantially higher data throughput compared to its predecessors, enabling
    the swift transmission of large volumes of spatio-temporal data from the edge
    layer to the fog layer. In agricultural settings, where data-rich applications
    such as precision agriculture and real-time monitoring are prevalent, the high
    bandwidth of 5G is instrumental in ensuring that critical information is transmitted
    without latency, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. Low Latency Communication:
    5G introduces significantly lower latency, reducing the time it takes for data
    to travel between the edge and fog layers. For Agriculture 5.0, where timely decision-making
    is imperative, low-latency communication is paramount. The near real-time responsiveness
    of 5G facilitates the seamless exchange of spatiotemporal data, enhancing the
    system’s ability to react swiftly to dynamic agricultural conditions. Reliable
    Connectivity in Rural Areas: 5G is designed to provide robust connectivity even
    in challenging and remote environments, addressing the connectivity limitations
    often encountered in rural areas. The deployment of edge components in rural settings
    demands a resilient communication infrastructure. 5G’s ability to penetrate remote
    areas ensures that data from the edge layer can reliably reach the fog layer,
    fostering a consistent flow of information crucial for effective spatio-temporal
    data management. Flexibility and Network Slicing: 5G introduces network slicing,
    allowing the creation of customized, isolated segments tailored to specific requirements.
    This flexibility enables the optimization of communication parameters based on
    the unique needs of edge-to-fog data transmission. Slices can be configured to
    balance latency, bandwidth, and reliability, ensuring that the communication architecture
    aligns precisely with the demands of the STSDMS for Agriculture 5.0. 5.2.2. Communication
    between fog and cloud layers The communication link between the fog and cloud
    layers is further enhanced by the integration of 5G technology, leveraging its
    advanced feature known as network slicing. Network Slicing for Latency Optimization:
    Network slicing allows the allocation of dedicated slices with low latency characteristics,
    ensuring timely data exchange between the fog and cloud layers. This optimization
    is particularly crucial for applications that require real-time responsiveness
    in Agriculture 5.0 systems. Bandwidth Management with Network Slicing: Different
    slices within the 5G network can be configured with varying bandwidth capacities.
    This capability ensures that data-intensive tasks in the fog layer can seamlessly
    communicate with cloud resources without encountering bottlenecks. Bandwidth management
    becomes a key aspect in optimizing data flow across system layers. Reliability
    and Security through Network Slicing: By isolating slices, network slicing enhances
    security and reliability in the communication path between the fog and cloud layers.
    This isolation prevents interference between different services and applications,
    fostering a secure and resilient data exchange environment. In summary, the holistic
    communication strategy encompasses (i) the use of wireless sensor networks for
    communication between devices and the edge layer of the system; (ii) the strategic
    integration of the 5G network slicing to optimize communication between the edge,
    fog, and cloud layers of the proposed system. This approach ensures that each
    level of the system works cohesively, addressing the specific connectivity challenges
    and requirements in the dynamic landscape of Agriculture 5.0. 5.3. Privacy-preserving
    AI techniques The integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) techniques within the framework of spatio-temporal semantic data management
    for Agriculture 5.0 offers a promising perspective for addressing challenges related
    to data privacy. In particular, privacy-preserving methodologies, such as federated
    learning, emerge as robust solutions. By incorporating a distributed approach,
    federated learning enables the training of ML models on edge devices without compromising
    the confidentiality of the data. This decentralized architecture improves the
    security and privacy of sensitive agricultural information while empowering the
    predictive and analytical capabilities of the global system. The strategic application
    of these AI techniques within the proposed architecture ensures not only efficient
    data management but also the safeguarding of privacy in the context of Agriculture
    5.0. 5.4. Integration of large language models in GUIs The integration of Large
    Language Models (LLMs) within Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to facilitate natural
    language querying of data repositories represents an innovative solution to address
    the limited technical expertise of farmers and agricultural specialists in the
    context of Agriculture 5.0. This integration enables non-technical users to formulate
    queries using everyday language expressions, with LLMs subsequently translating
    these queries into technically comprehensible commands for STSDMSs. This strategy
    simplifies interaction, improving the accessibility and usability of the system,
    thus overcoming the barrier of technical complexity to promote a wider and more
    effective adoption of technology within the agricultural sector. 5.5. STSDMS to
    enable the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence Integration of
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models in the domain of
    Agriculture 5.0 represents one of the main research topics today. The development
    and implementation of decision support systems (DSS) and predictive models, as
    well as the use of neural networks to forecast, for instance, weather conditions,
    are currently highly relevant approaches. These approaches offer a number of key
    benefits, including resource optimization, improved energy efficiency, and the
    ability to adapt agricultural tasks based on accurate weather forecasts or changes
    in field and crop conditions. The development of solutions based on AI and ML
    models is divided into two main phases: training and model validation. In this
    respect, Spatial–Temporal Semantic Data Management Systems play a key role in
    the development of such solutions. These systems allow the management, storage,
    and processing of historical data, which in turn enables the generation of datasets
    for training AI and ML models. Furthermore, real-time management of current data
    collected by devices and agents deployed in the field provides the necessary input
    information to validate trained models and subsequently deploy them in the production
    environment. Therefore, the distributed architecture presented in this paper is
    revealed as an essential element to facilitate the integration and development
    of AI-based solutions. The cloud layer of the proposed system provides the computational
    capabilities and historical data storage needed to feed the AI and ML models in
    the training phase. Due to these capabilities, the training and subsequent validation
    of the models are performed in isolation from the rest of the system layers with
    lower computational capabilities. This enables the models to be trained through
    continuous spatio-temporal queries to the central repositories located in the
    cloud, without interfering with the correct operation of the system. Once the
    models have been trained and validated, the proposed distributed architecture
    allows the trained models to be deployed at the STSDMS edge layer. By deploying
    the AI or ML models at the edge, data reception is enabled at runtime, thus enabling
    models operation in near real-time. This gives the farmer or specialist the ability
    to make more informed decisions in an agile manner, based on the accurate predictions
    and recommendations provided by the AI or ML models, by integrating these processes
    into the edge layer of the system itself. 6. Conclusions The paper outlines the
    requirements and problems described by Agriculture 5.0 scenarios and solutions
    in the management of data of a spatio-temporal semantic nature. Through these
    needs, a selection of the eleven most prominent spatio-temporal semantic data
    management systems to date in the agricultural application domain is made. The
    selected STSDMSs have been studied through the current literature on their data
    sources, architectures, solved problems, and validation scenarios. Eight aspects
    (accessibility, scalability, interoperability, etc.) of the SQuaRE standard have
    been selected and treated as criteria for the evaluation of these STSDMSs and
    the detection of their deficiencies. As a result of the evaluation, it has been
    detected that the STSDMSs only comply with an average evaluation of 15.09 stars
    (out of a total of 24 stars). Following the evaluation of the literature, it is
    evident that the STSDMS developed on the intelligent AFarCloud platform exhibits
    the most advanced capabilities in the current paradigm to address identified challenges.
    With a total score of 20 stars out of 24 (83.33%), the AFarCloud STSDMS provides
    the most suitable approach. However, a significant limitation of this system lies
    in the utilization of a native data model, specifically developed for the project,
    thereby restricting the interoperability of the system with other models and ontologies.
    Based on the evaluation results, the following challenges have been described:
    (i) simplifying graphical user interfaces to improve accessibility; (ii) definition
    of a standard agricultural data model to achieve interoperability; (iii) using
    machine learning techniques for translation between existing data models; (iv)
    deployment of the STSDMS architecture between the edge and the cloud to overcome
    connectivity issues and enable real-time operation; (v) distribution of repositories
    in databases for historical data and latest measures to increase performance;
    (vi) implementing continuous queries and continuous processing for knowledge extraction;
    and (vii) adopt the knowledge of agricultural experts to enrich and correct the
    data semantically. To address the identified challenges and limitations, this
    paper presents a proposal designed to effectively overcome them. The proposal
    focuses on the implementation of Spatio-Temporal Semantic Data Management Systems
    (STSDMS) through a distributed architecture at the edge, fog, and cloud layers.
    This configuration allows achieving real-time operations, applying privacy-preserving
    techniques and anonymizing farm data, and enhancing the adaptability and scalability
    capabilities of STSDMSs. In detail, the proposal addresses the choice of optimal
    technologies for communication between devices and the edge layer and between
    the various layers of the architecture. The importance of overcoming the limitations
    of current Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by exploring the use of Large Language
    Models (LLMs) is particularly highlighted. LLMs are emerging as key tools to facilitate
    the interaction of nontechnical users with the STSDMS GUIs, thus improving the
    accessibility and usability of the system. Finally, the suitability of the proposal
    for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
    models is explored. This integration is presented as an essential component to
    enhance the intelligence and predictive capacity of the system, contributing to
    a more efficient management of spatio-temporal data. In general, the proposal
    comprehensively addresses the identified challenges, offering a robust and advanced
    perspective for the development and application of STSDMSs in the context of Agriculture
    5.0. In conclusion, the detected challenges demonstrate future trends in the development
    of STSDMSs for the achievement of Agriculture 5.0 through advanced Internet of
    Things technologies. It is very promising to see how future research can improve
    the performance and development of STSDMSs through the achievement of the detected
    challenges. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mario San Emeterio de la

  description: In the context of population growth and limited resources, the efficiency
    and sustainability of agricultural production became particularly important. Smart
    agricultural technology and Internet of Things (IoT) technology have helped farmers
    with better management tools to improve crop yield and quality. This research

    Smart agricultureIoTCloud platformGreenhouse controlSTM32 1. Introduction Smart
    agriculture is an agricultural development mode that uses modern science and technology
    to improve agricultural production efficiency and reduce resource waste. With
    the growth of the global population and the impact of climate change, traditional
    agriculture is facing many challenges such as land scarcity, water scarcity, and
    environmental pollution. Under this background, smart agriculture emerge as the
    times require. It achieves precise management and intelligent decision-making
    in agriculture through applying advanced sensing technology, cloud computing and
    IoT [1]. Greenhouse agriculture is one of the most important. Greenhouses provide
    controlled environmental conditions that allow plants to grow at any time of the
    day or night. At present, the application of IoT in agricultural greenhouse management
    has become a hotspot of human attention. It has changed traditional agriculture
    which is limited by many factors such as natural environment, geographical location,
    and climate. Smart greenhouse control system can realize the development and application
    of smart agriculture. It can monitor and control aspects such as light, water
    flow, inlet pipe pressure, supply voltage, ground temperature and humidity, air
    temperature and humidity, and so on, in order to improve the agricultural production
    efficiency of greenhouse [2]. However, there are still some problems in current
    greenhouse agriculture. Since environmental parameter in greenhouse is usually
    set by human, such as temperature, humidity, light and so on. Therefore it is
    unable to accurately monitor and manage the environment and crop growth. In addition,
    productivity is affected by seasonal and weather conditions that limit greenhouse
    crop growth [3]. The Smart Agriculture Greenhouse Cloud Control System is designed
    to solve these problems in an IoT way, as shown in Fig. 1. Based on IoT technology,
    the sensor network can monitor environmental parameters and crop cultivation inside
    and outside greenhouse in real time. And it transmits these data to the cloud
    platform for processing. Cloud computing and big data analytics can generate appropriate
    control strategies on cloud platform based on crop needs and growth patterns.
    The cloud platform sends commands through control equipment, thus adjusting temperature,
    humidity, carbon dioxide and other environmental parameters in the greenhouse,
    eventually realizing precise control of crop growth environment [4]. In this way,
    crop yield can be maximized, resource use can be improved, energy consumption
    can be reduced, and stability in crop production and quality can be ensured. Therefore,
    it is an ideal solution to solve problems and difficulties of current greenhouse
    grow systems by creating a cloud-based smart greenhouse control system. It achieves
    precise monitor and control of the environment inside and outside greenhouse and
    the growth of crops through applying advanced information technology. And it improves
    resource utilization efficiency, optimizes production management, and improves
    crop yield and quality. Smart agricultural greenhouse cloud control system can
    bring high economic benefits to farmers, reduce environmental harm and promote
    sustainable development of agriculture [5]. This paper aims to design a smart
    agricultural greenhouse cloud control system based on IOT to achieve the above
    objectives. The system workflow is as follows. Firstly, environmental data be
    collected by STM32 microcontroller, wireless communication module, sensors and
    other devices. Then, ESP8266 WiFi module transmits the data to AliCloud’s interface,
    and these data are visualized on the cloud. Finally, the user can connect to the
    cloud by cell phone or computer to view greenhouse environmental conditions in
    real time. Through the above research methodology and experimental design, we
    hope to derive the effect of smart agriculture greenhouse cloud control system
    to improve greenhouse agricultural production efficiency, save energy, change
    crops growth environment and other aspects. It provides a useful reference for
    the development of IoT and smart agriculture. Download : Download high-res image

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights related
    work that has been done and is in progress in the area of greenhouse control.
    Section 3 discusses the various components used in the proposed system. Section
    4 describes the architecture and implementation of the system. Experimental results
    of the proposed work are given in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the conclusions
    and future scope. 2. Related work Smart greenhouse control is a very interesting
    research topic and researchers have been working on smart control systems for
    agricultural greenhouses. This section gives a brief description of existing solutions
    for developing the smart control of greenhouses. At present, designing and developing
    control systems by using IoT, has become a trend in the application of agricultural
    greenhouse management technology. It changes the situation of traditional agriculture,
    which is constrained by a variety of factors, including the natural environment,
    geography and climate. People have designed smart control system applications
    through IoT. It effectively improves environmental conditions inside greenhouse,
    which includes temperature, humidity, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration,
    and other factors. So it has positive significance for improving crop yield and
    quality [6]. IoT agricultural greenhouse measurement and control technology can
    realize the automatic detection of agricultural area information. For example,
    we can set up wireless sensor nodes, information collection devices, information
    routing devices, solar power supply system and wireless sensor transmission system.
    In this way, we can monitor parameters such as soil moisture, soil temperature,
    air humidity, temperature, light intensity and plant nutrient content [7]. Where
    the wireless sensor aggregation nodes are created through IoT [8]. The system
    dynamically manages, displays, analyzes and processes the greenhouse’s environmental
    factors and provides visualization graphs for the farmer. Depending on crop need,
    system provides information about various text, sound and light alarms. IoT greenhouse
    smart measurement and control system realizes automatic operation of the greenhouse.
    It not only reduces energy consumption and operating costs, but also provides
    an ideal growth environment for plants. In addition it reduces people’s work intensity
    and improves equipment utilization. It also improves greenhouse climate, reduces
    pests and diseases, and increases crop yields [9]. Greenhouse farms still face
    many challenges in terms of efficient operation and management. Continuously evolving
    IoT technology, including smart sensor, device, network topology, big data analytic,
    and smart decision-making, is recognized as a solution to solve major challenges
    in greenhouse agriculture. For example, it is used in greenhouse local climate
    control, crop growth monitoring and crop reaping [10]. With agricultural informatization
    level constantly improving, Chinese greenhouse smart measurement and control system
    has made great progress in terms of technology and scale. However, we still have
    a big gap in the field of smart greenhouse control compared with developed countries,
    especially in production stability control, modernization and industrialization
    of supporting facilities [11]. Overseas greenhouses often use automatic control
    system to monitor and control greenhouse environments. These systems usually include
    sensor, actuator and controller. Sensor is used to monitor environmental parameters
    such as temperature, humidity and light. Controller sends commands to make devices
    such as ventilation and irrigation work to keep ideal environmental conditions
    in the greenhouse. Control methods use advanced control techniques, including
    fuzzy control, model predictive control, neural network control and adaptive control.
    Besides, it uses physical model-based control, state feedback control and control
    methods based on optimal control theory. They are all well known in improving
    greenhouse crop production performance, and these control technologies usually
    have strong data analysis and decision support capabilities. It collects and analyzes
    data about the greenhouse environment and plant growth. Based on the data, the
    system is able to provide accurate decision support and optimize management strategy
    [12]. In contrast, China’s greenhouse control has just started, and most of greenhouses
    are manually operated. There are fewer control methods, only traditional PID control,
    fuzzy control, neural network control and so on. Greenhouse data analysis and
    decision support levels are relatively low, and there is still much improvement
    space [13]. However, Chinese greenhouse control systems can be better adapted
    to need and actual situation of local agriculture. Since local agricultural organization
    and crop characteristics are different from other countries, China’s greenhouse
    control system is closer to the needs of domestic agriculture in terms of design
    and functionality. So it can provide more personalized and precise control strategies
    and technical solutions [14]. China is a vast country, farmers are relatively
    conservative in their thinking, and it is difficult to unify the standards of
    the agricultural industry chain. As a result, there are difficulties in collecting,
    analyzing, integrating and sharing information resources. In terms of agricultural
    production, small farmers are the majority. That is why it is difficult to unify
    scale, mechanization and systematization. The cultural level of farmers is generally
    low, so that the promotion of smart technologies and ecological concepts is not
    progressing fast enough. In addition smart agricultural technology development
    has three major contradictions and problems: resource environment, science and
    technology shortcomings, and institutional deficiencies [15]. In traditional greenhouse,
    climatic variables and other growth methods depend on the grower’s assessment.
    But smart greenhouse growing is a closed growing process where greenhouse is managed
    through information and communication technology (ICT). It improves quality and
    quantity of crops and minimizes human participation [16]. Emerging IoT technology
    offers huge potential to develop innovative approaches and smart solutions that
    can change the agriculture sector in every way. Therefore, combining IoT with
    greenhouse and transforming them into smart automatic greenhouse is considered
    as one of the most ideal solutions [17]. When the IoT started to emerge, some
    people started to research smart greenhouse. Li et al. [18] have proposed an agricultural
    greenhouse environment monitoring system based on IOT, combining the Internet,
    wireless networks, and mobile. It realizes remote real-time monitoring of greenhouse
    environmental information. The implementation method is as follows. Through ZigBee
    protocol, a wireless sensor network was built for collecting environmental information
    such as temperature and humidity. Finally, the collected environmental information
    was accessed to the Internet and mobile network through the control center, which
    realized the SMS heating and real-time monitoring of agricultural environmental
    information. However, when a text message is received, it cannot be immediately
    controlled accordingly. Such as when the temperature is too high, the vent opening
    size cannot be regulated immediately. Ahmad et al. [19] have proposed a method
    for greenhouse management and monitoring using Memsic and Zigbee technology. The
    system can monitor soil temperature and humidity, air temperature, and light radiation.
    All sensors are able to collect data from the greenhouse and send it to the microcontroller
    on a regular basis. Data is sent from transmitter to the receiver and displayed
    on a device such as smartphone, laptop or PDA. It uses MP Lab and LabView softwares
    in programming and interfacing process. Although the system can monitor the growing
    environment of the greenhouse through the device, it cannot control greenhouse
    remotely. With the development of IoT, more and more programs are proposed. Cao
    et al. [20] proposed a wireless agricultural monitoring platform by Mesh Wi-Fi
    network. The system consists of a root node, three relays and six nodes. Each
    node has three sensors for measuring parameters, including soil moisture and soil
    temperature, ambient temperature and ambient humidity of the farm, and light intensity.
    The collected data is transferred from the node to the root node, then updated
    to the cloud database and displayed on the dashboard. The MEAN stack-based site
    will create real-time information tracking and keep historical data for the owner.
    However, the system does not have a complete cloud-based platform, so it cannot
    remotely control greenhouse operations by Internet. The system built through wireless
    sensor networks and cloud platforms works extremely well. Ping et al. [21] have
    proposed an IoT and ARM-based framework for soil moisture control and irrigation
    management. In this system, the values obtained by the sensors are stored on a
    cloud server and necessary suggestions are provided over the web. When the ground
    temperature is high and soil moisture is low, an automatic irrigation system is
    triggered and the user is also notified by email. Users can easily monitor the
    irrigation system through the cloud server and mobile web application. Jing et
    al. [22] have proposed a distributed agricultural service system that integrates
    social and physical information in order to provide decision support from farmers.
    The system uses wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and distributed systems
    architecture to manage people, plots, crops, and equipment. Services include crop
    planning, production guidance, and equipment control. User terminals include computers,
    mobile applications and applets. 3. Components used in the proposed system The
    composition of a control system needs to have controller, sensor, actuator, controlled
    object. In addition, it also needs communication module, display module and so
    on. They work together to form a perfect control system. The proposed system provides
    a cost-effective solution for detecting environmental conditions in greenhouses,
    which can be controlled automatically or manually remotely through the Internet.
    According to the current price, accuracy, and ease of use of controllers and sensors;
    the applicability and difficulty of compiling software; and the price and applicability
    of cloud platforms, we choose following components. But users can choose higher
    accuracy sensors or faster speed controllers depending on the specific use situation,
    which of course means a higher price. 3.1. STM32F407ZGT6 microcontroller The STM32F407ZGT6
    is a microcontroller unit based on a high-performance ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit RISC
    core operating at up to 168MHz. Cortex-M4 core has a floating point unit (FPU)

    sensor The sensing part of the wind speed sensor is formed by three conical or
    hemispherical empty cups [25]. Three hemispherical or conical hollow cup shells
    are fixed to a trident star-shaped bracket at to each other or to a cross-shaped
    bracket at to each other. The bracket made of plastic or alloy. The inductive
    part is connected to an engine. The empty cup rotates, driving the engine rotor
    to produce current. When the rotor is faster, the current is higher and the voltage
    at the ends of the generator is higher. The wind speed sensor is connected to
    the microcontroller through a connecting wire, which is used to measure the voltage
    across the sensor and then obtain the actual wind speed. Based on the wind speed,
    the wind level at that time is obtained through a self-writing program. The wind
    speed sensor output voltage signal and wind speed calculation formula is shown
    in Eq. (1): (1) where means wind speed in , means voltage in . 3.4. Raindrop sensor
    The sensor is made of high-quality FR-04 double-sided material with a large area
    of , and its surface is treated with nickel-plating technology [26]. Therefore,
    the module has excellent performance in terms of oxidation resistance, electrical
    conductivity, and longevity. In addition, the module is capable of data transfer
    via digital and analog. 3.5. DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor The DHT11 is
    an integrated temperature and humidity sensor that includes a moisture-measuring
    element and a temperature-measuring element [27]. The communication method between
    the DHT11 and the microcontroller is single bus communication, so that only one
    data line is required to achieve communication with the microcontroller. In addition,
    the DHT11 has very low power consumption. When the operating voltage is 5 , the
    average maximum current is 0.5 . 3.6. BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor The
    BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor module is a digital integrated circuit for
    serial bus interface. It uses the IIC communication protocol, operates on DC5
    , and its input illumination range is from 1 to 65 535 [28]. 3.7. SGP30 gas sensor
    The SGP30 is a gas sensor that provides detailed information on actual air quality
    level or concentration, such as ppm for airborne CO and actual level of volatile
    organic compound [29]. The module has excellent long-term stability, resistance
    to contamination caused by silicone, TVOC output, and H2-based CO equivalent output.
    3.8. Wireless communication module NRF24L01 The NRF24L01 is a wireless communication
    module with FSK modulation and NORDIC Enhanced Short Burst Protocol. It supports
    point-to-point or point-to-multipoint wireless communication up to six nodes.
    The communication band is 2.4G, and the communication rate is up to 2 Mbps. The
    module adopts the highly efficient GFSK modulation method, which has strong anti-interference
    ability. It can realize the requirements of multipoint or specific frequency modulation
    communication in 126 selectable channels. The features and benefits of the module
    are summed up below: • Long wireless communication range. The NRF24L01 module
    supports the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It has adjustable communication range that can
    reach about 100 m in the best case. • Reliable and stable. NRF24L01 module adopts
    frequency hopping technology. It has strong anti-interference and stability performance.
    It can keep excellent communication quality in complex wireless environment. •
    Fast response time. The NRF24L01 module has fast switching times and transmission
    rates up to 2 Mbps. Thus, it is well adapted for real-time data transmission and
    applications that requires fast response times. • Multinode communication. The
    NRF24L01 module supports multinode network communication. It can achieve communication
    modes of point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint. As
    a result, it can flexibly adapt to the needs of various communication topologies.
    • Simple interface. NRF24L01 module connects to the microcontroller with simple
    interface that uses SPI communication protocol. Therefore small number of I/O
    pins can realize communication with external controller. • Cost-effective. The
    NRF24L01 module offers excellent performance and price ratio. It is one of the
    cost-effective wireless communication solutions for many IoT and embedded applications.
    Although 2.4 GHz frequency wireless communication has high penetration power,
    the communication distance is relatively short. In practical applications, when
    communication distance exceeds 100 m, it may encounter problem that data cannot
    be reliably received. For longer communication distances, LORA communication module
    with 433 MHz frequency can be considered as an alternative to NRF24L01. LORA technology
    has a larger communication range that can reach several kilometers or even farther.
    However, it is important to note that as an alternative, LORA communication module
    can be more expensive, it costs three times as much as NRF24L01. 3.9. ATK-ESP8266
    WiFi module The ATK-ESP8266 is a high-performance UART-WiFi module [30]. The communication
    modes are as follows. ATK-ESP8266 module communicates data with a microcontroller
    through serial port communication and can realize transformation between serial
    port and WiFi. After configuring the serial port, this module can transmit data
    through the network. For example, when the module is configured with relevant
    parameters through AT commands, it can connect to WiFi. After that it can connect
    to the cloud based on domain name, protocol of the cloud platform. In addition
    the selected ESP8266 module can be replaced by 4G DTU in case of higher requirements.
    But the price is several times of ESP8266. 3.10. TFTLCD screen TFTLCD, also called
    Thin-Film Transistor Liquid-Crystal Display, is a flat panel display made using
    thin-film transistor technology and liquid crystal display technology. It consists
    of thin-film transistor array, liquid crystal material layer, color filter layer
    and backlight. The liquid crystal display (LCD) has a thin-film transistor (TFT)
    set on each pixel. Which can effectively avoid crosstalk during non-selective,
    and make the static characteristics of LCD independent of the number of scanning
    lines. Thus the image quality is greatly improved. TFTLCD has the following characteristics:
    high resolution, good color performance, wide viewing angle, fast response time,
    low power consumption. We chose the size of 7-inch screen, which resolution is
    800 × 480, with 16-bit true color display. 3.11. Keil5 development software Keil5

    it supports many different microcontroller architectures such as ARM, Cortex-M
    and 8051. All in all, Keil5 is a powerful, easy to use embedded software development
    tool that helps developers quickly build high quality embedded systems. 3.12.

    provided by AliCloud. It provides a series of technologies and tools, and it supports
    the access, management and data interaction of IoT devices. It is widely used
    in the field of IoT and can support IoT applications in a variety of fields such

    of business needs, such as device interconnection, data sharing, intelligent analysis,
    and so on, through the AliCloud IoT platform. Which effectively improves the intelligence
    and sustainability of IoT applications. 4. Architecture and implementation The
    architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of four parts:
    sensor acquisition control network, network transmitter, application platform,
    and greenhouse equipment management. Sensor acquisition control network collects
    the environmental information in real time; BeiDou/GPS module performs the location
    positioning; TFTLCD screen displays the collected data, latitude, longitude, time
    and other information in real time [31]. The wireless communication module is
    responsible for information interaction with the network transmitter [32]. Network
    Transmitter’s role is sending the environmental information collected by the received
    sensors to the cloud through the ESP8266WiFi module. These information processed
    and stored in the database. Sensor acquisition control network and network transmitter
    systems use hardware as shown in Table 2. The application platform is built on
    AliCloud IoT platform [33]. After building the project and connecting the devices,
    we create various physical models and display the data on the cloud platform.
    Through data communication and information interaction, visualization platform
    is constructed on the AliCloud platform. It includes a Web-side visualization
    platform and a mobile-side visualization platform. We can access the Internet
    through a computer or cell phone, thus enabling automatic control the various
    agricultural equipment in the greenhouse. Sensor acquisition control network.
    The STM32F407ZGT6 is used as the main controller to obtain the air temperature
    and air humidity inside and outside the greenhouse through the DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor, get the light intensity inside the greenhouse through the
    BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor, get the carbon dioxide concentration inside
    the greenhouse through the SGP30 gas sensor, get the temperature and humidity
    of the soil in the greenhouse through the soil temperature and humidity sensor,
    get the wind speed outside the greenhouse through the wind speed sensor, and get
    the rainfall outside the greenhouse through the rainfall sensor [34]. At the same
    time combined with BeiDou/GPS module for location positioning. The information
    obtained after comprehensive processing is displayed on TFTLCD liquid crystal
    display [35]. Through the NRF24L01 wireless communication module, the collected
    data are sent to the network transmitter according to the specified communication
    mode, communication address, and communication band [36]. Download : Download

    Transmitter, which receives information from the greenhouse and sends it to the
    cloud platform. Upper left: Application Platform, which detects and controls the
    greenhouse system. Network transmitter. The network transmitter uses the STM32F103RCT6
    microcontroller as the main controller. In the environment with network, the ESP8266
    module can automatically connect to the network and AliCloud platform after the
    microcontroller is power on. The wireless communication module receives the data
    which is sent from the sensor acquisition and control network, and then it is
    sent to AliCloud through the ESP8266 module. The working condition is displayed
    on the OLED screen. Application platform. First of all, we need to write C program
    by keil5 software. That is, according to the information of ESP8266, we write
    AT command suitable for UART serial port. Then, microcontroller makes use of the
    serial port to communicate with ESP8266 module. The purpose is make the ESP8266
    module connect to Aliyun by successively receiving a reset command, a mode setting
    command, a WiFi connection command, and a connect to Aliyun domain name command.
    After that, microcontroller sends topic subscription through MQTT protocol. ESP8266
    connects through the Internet and sends relevant data according to MQTT protocol.
    AliCloud performs JSON data parse to communicate between ESP8266 and cloud. AliCloud
    distributes the data through data transfer protocol so that server gets a series
    of data streams. As a result, internal servers such as Web server are able to
    perform display and control operations based on the constructed visualization
    platform. Finally, we inserted component models on the visualization platform
    to connect physical devices and uploaded data. Table 2. Hardware required for

    data big screen control is usually used in larger scale data monitor and display
    scene. For complex data management and control need, big screen control can provide
    better operation experience and detail display. In contrast, the mobile control
    is less, screen size is limited, display of information and charts is relatively
    small. The big data screen in cloud control is usually fixed operation site. While
    mobile control has greater flexibility and portability. Users can monitor and
    control through mobile phones anywhere and anytime. According to specific use
    scenario and need, users can choose the control method that suits them. Greenhouse
    equipment management. First of all, the various agricultural equipment in the
    greenhouse needs to be networked with wireless devices in the 2.4G band, so that
    it can communicate with the network transmitter. TThen, the device can turn on
    or off by receiving data commands. For example, opening and closing of irrigation
    valves, size of valve openings, and extent of irrigation in a greenhouse are determined
    by soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, and webcam. For roller shutter control,
    the system has three phase motor switching control, insulation blanket position
    detection, data uploading, and so on. In the control of the sunshade, the system
    has shade and retraction control of the sunshade and so on. However, the above
    operation is difficult to construct a hardware system, so we constructed a ventilation
    control device. The size of vent is controlled by a stepper motor [37]. The stepper
    motor is powered by a switching power supply with specifications of 220 V input
    and 24 V output. The ventilation system performs motion control combining information
    received from the sensors and position data measured by the laser distance measuring
    module. In addition, ESP8266 WiFi module can receive information from the cloud,
    which enables remote manual network control. The exact control information and
    relevant data are displayed on the OLED screen. The control algorithm employs
    dual-mode control, that is, PID control and Bang-Bang control. The Bang-Bang ＋
    PID control algorithm has high dynamic performance and can reduce response time
    and steady-state error of system [38]. Meanwhile, the algorithm is simple to implement
    and suitable for real-time control system. The main controller is STM32F407VET6,
    which can receive sensor or Aliyun information through NRF24L01 module or ATK-ESP8266
    WiFi module. Based on the received information, the program combines the environmental
    parameters to calculate the adjustment data for the vents. This value is used
    as controller output [39]. This value is converted to the frequency of the PWM
    output. Finally, the signal from the controller is output to the stepper motor
    controller so that the stepper motor can be controlled. The hardware used for
    the vent control system is shown in Table 3. The Bang-Bang ＋ PID control algorithm
    is divided into two stages: When the system error is large, Bang-Bang control
    is used; when the system error is small, PID control is used. As shown in Eq.
    (2). (2) where -control output; -error between input and feedback; -proportional
    coefficient; -sampling time; -integral time constant; -differential time constant;
    -output of Bang-Bang control. is the switching function of the two algorithms.
    When 0, 1, system is used for Bang Bang control; When 1, 0, system is used for
    control. Table 3. Hardware required for vent consoles. Equipment Number Function

    environmental factors in a natural outdoor environment. The working model of the
    proposed system is shown in Fig. 3. The experiment consisted of the following

    data STM32F407ZGT6 collects data from DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors and
    DS18B20 temperature sensor by single-bus communication protocol; collects data
    from light sensor and SGP30 sensor by IIC communication protocol; collects data
    from wind speed sensor, raindrop sensor and soil humidity sensor by ADC interface,
    and receives positional information from BeiDou/GPS module by serial communication
    protocol. Then, all of the above data are processed and displayed on the TFTLCD
    screen. According to the SPI communication protocol, the data are sent to the
    network transmitter by NRF24L01 wireless communication module. When testing is
    performed, the designed device is placed in a simulated environment. During testing,
    we found that the microcontroller module is able to work as expected. The system
    can detect the environmental data and display it in the TFTLCD screen. The Fig.
    4 shows the detected environmental data of the system in the simulated environment.

    and cloud big screen, they can both transfer and share data through cloud service.
    Users can share data on different devices. They can realize the function is basically
    the same. In complex control, the mobile device is no match for the network big
    screen control. However, for some simple functions, their realization is basically

    and future research work 6.1. Conclusions The model put out in this work aims
    to accomplish centralized management and automated control, both of which are
    significant goals. A centralized monitoring and control center is provided by
    this technology, which centralizes the collection of greenhouse data in real-time.
    Through the cloud platform, administrators may check on changes to the greenhouse
    environment, crop growth, and numerous parameter indicators whenever and wherever
    they want. The cloud platform offers remote monitoring and management of greenhouse
    machinery, including irrigation systems, temperature control, and ventilation.
    To achieve automatic modification of the greenhouse environment and enhance crop
    quality and production effectiveness, administrators can remotely set control
    parameters through the cloud platform. 6.2. Future research work However, despite
    the fact that the cloud platform can be automatically controlled by gathering
    data about the greenhouse’s temperature, humidity, light, etc., there is no combination
    of data analysis and algorithmic modeling in the cloud platform to provide correct
    cloud control. That is one way forward. The given information can be used to further
    improve the system and expand its usefulness on the cloud platform. In order to
    create more accurate models and offer more precise management solutions, the greenhouse
    data obtained is thoroughly examined and learned from. For example, combining
    crop growth models and meteorological data to predict future trends in the greenhouse
    environment. From there, factors like ventilation and irrigation are changed to
    improve crop quality and yield. Following this, the settings for irrigation and
    ventilation are fine-tuned in order to optimize both crop quality and productivity.

    LELBC consumes 1864 gate equivalents (GE) in area and 6.99 J/bit in energy (encryption
    + decryption) under the UMC 1P6M process library. LELBC decreases energy and area
    consumption by 24.02% and 24.04%, respectively, compared to Midori. Finally, a
    temperature collection and encryption transmission platform is established. LELBC
    is deployed on the platform to encrypt the collected data, establishing the first
    line of defense for the secure transmission of smart agriculture sensor data.

    arrival of the fifth generation (5G) era is bringing new applications, such as
    smart agriculture, to us faster and better than ever before. At the same time,
    new application scenarios are not possible without a large number of IoT devices.
    Accordingly, many IoT technologies are continuously proposed [1], [2]. Smart agriculture
    mainly uses information technology management methods to carry out agricultural
    production and operations [3]. It timely acquires environmental factors affecting
    crop production, such as temperature, and automatically adjusts production conditions
    through “thing-to-thing” connectivity, thereby effectively improving the quality
    of agricultural products and production efficiency. But the massive collection
    of data is likely to lead to serious leakage problems [4]. Malicious hackers,
    through attacks on IoT devices such as sensors, may access data collected by sensors
    about the environment or livestock or even tamper with them, as there is a lack
    of encryption protection measures [5]. These attacks seriously damage the confidentiality
    of data, posing a serious threat to the proper operation and supply of monitoring
    services and even causing substantial economic losses. Currently, multiple security
    protection schemes are proposed for this problem, including encrypting the collected
    data before transmission [6]. Post-Quantum Cryptography has become a hot topic
    nowadays with the emergence of quantum computers. But the development of standards
    for post-quantum cryptography is still in progress. Meanwhile, symmetric ciphers
    can resist the attack of quantum computers by expanding the key size. Hence, we
    can still employ lightweight block ciphers to protect resource-constrained IoT
    devices in smart agriculture. Numerous lightweight block ciphers have been proposed
    in recent years that are widely used in the IoT, such as SIMON [7], SPEEDY [8],
    PRINCE [9], SCARF [10], SHADOW [11], IVLBC [12], QARMA [13], etc. However, the
    design requirements of ciphers vary in different environments [14], [15]. For
    example, the Internet of Vehicles requires low-latency cipher algorithms [16].
    The existing sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles used in smart agriculture are
    battery-powered. They suffer from limited energy resources [17]. Also, the computational
    complexity of the device itself should not be reduced to minimize battery usage
    [18]. It is critical that cipher algorithms designed for such devices minimize
    energy consumption [19]. Energy will be more tightly constrained in future infophysical
    systems as well as in the next generation of implantable devices [20]. There is
    currently no unified standard for cipher algorithms in terms of energy consumption
    evaluation. Consequently, we take the energy consumption of existing low-energy
    cipher algorithms as the basic standard for our research, such as Midori, PRINCE,
    and so on. The minimization of energy consumption based on existing research can
    lead to a broader application of cipher algorithms in the future. Recently, energy-optimized
    ciphers have received increasing attention. The classic low energy lightweight
    block cipher Midori was proposed by Subhadeep Banik et al. [21]. Later, they also
    proposed a low energy stream cipher [22]. In 2017, Bui et al. performed hardware
    optimization for the AES cipher in terms of power consumption and energy [23].
    Carlos et al. optimized the PRESENT cipher on FPGA hardware based on area, performance,
    and energy [24]. In 2020, Bassam J. et al. proposed a new algorithm for managing
    cipher energy consumption [25]. Avik Chakraborti proposed a lightweight, low energy
    authentication encryption mode [26]. Most of these proposed energy-optimized ciphers
    use substitution permutation networks (SPN) structures to improve diffusion and
    reduce the number of rounds to achieve low energy performance. Cipher algorithms
    that adopt the SPN structure require additional resource consumption during decryption
    due to the inconsistent encryption and decryption. As a result, energy consumption
    is often not particularly low when encryption and decryption are calculated to
    consume energy together. The Feistel structure can be encrypted and decrypted
    consistently, but the cipher algorithms using the Feistel structure require more
    rounds to ensure their security. The energy consumption increases exponentially
    as the number of rounds increases. Beyond the structure, the area and latency
    of the components also affect the energy consumption of the algorithm as a whole.
    Choosing a low-area and low-latency S-box is also a design requirement for low
    energy algorithms, as S-boxes are the most important non-linear component in cipher
    algorithms. There is still potential to better achieve low energy consumption
    in unified ED circuits, although researchers have done some research on low energy
    ciphers. In this paper, a new low energy lightweight block cipher (LELBC) is proposed,
    focusing on energy-resource-constrained devices in smart agriculture. We have
    conducted a security analysis and hardware implementation of LELBC. Experimental
    results show that LELBC is resistant to differential attack, linear attack, algebraic
    attack, meet-in-the-middle attack, and slide attack. LELBC can also adopt some
    existing error detection schemes to resist fault attacks in practical applications.
    Moreover, LELBC is optimal in terms of energy and area in unified ED circuits
    compared to existing lightweight ciphers. Thus, the deployment of LELBC in the
    perception layer of smart agriculture can provide security for it. The structure
    of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the encryption mode of LELBC.
    In Section 3, the specification of LELBC is described. The design principles of
    LELBC are given in Section 4. Section 5 describes the security analysis of LELBC
    through various analysis methods. The implementation of LELBC is presented in
    Section 6. A temperature acquisition platform is established to simulate temperature
    monitoring in smart agriculture, and LELBC was successfully applied to the platform.
    Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper with an overview of the future. 1.1. Motivation
    Attention to agricultural production has been increasing in recent years with
    global warming and a growing population. Simultaneously, malicious hackers have
    been looking for vulnerabilities in smart agriculture to attack. Since smart agriculture
    is a key component of the economy, trade, and food supply, its data leakage could
    place food security at risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to maintain
    security in smart agriculture. Many resource-constrained IoT devices, such as
    sensors in smart agriculture, are powered by batteries [27]. Energy is quite an
    important element in these devices [28]. Designing a low energy lightweight block
    cipher for IoT devices in the sensing layer is beneficial for defending data security
    in smart agriculture. Nowadays, most of the low energy ciphers or cipher algorithms
    optimized for energy, such as Midori, AES, PRESENT, etc., still have potential
    to be optimized in terms of energy consumption. Firstly, in terms of structure,
    these cipher algorithms all adopt SPN structure. It is well known that the general
    SPN structure is usually not applicable to unified ED circuits. They consume more
    hardware resources and energy if they are to be used in environments where decryption
    routines are required. In smart agriculture environments, the encrypted sensor
    data needs to be decrypted before it can be displayed. Smart agriculture requires
    an algorithmic structure that can be applied to unified ED circuits. Secondly,
    in terms of the nonlinear layer, the existing 4-bit involutive S-boxes are not
    yet optimal in terms of area and delay. Therefore, this paper designs a low energy
    lightweight cipher algorithm for smart agriculture based on the highly consistent
    structure of encryption and decryption and the low-energy S-box. 1.2. Our contribution
    We propose a new low energy lightweight cipher named LELBC for resource-constrained
    IoT devices in smart agriculture. A PSP structure with highly consistent encryption
    and decryption and a low-area, low-latency involutive S-box are designed from
    the structure and components, respectively, so as to achieve a lower energy consumption
    for LELBC in the hardware. Firstly, we found that two identical P diffusion layers
    do not diffuse well, even though it is better to achieve consistent encryption
    and decryption. Therefore, we design two highly symmetric P-diffusion layers to
    achieve the symmetry of the PSP structure so that it can be applied to the unified
    encryption–decryption circuit. Secondly, we obtained a low-area, low-latency involutive
    S-box to achieve low energy consumption of the nonlinear layer by a genetic algorithm.
    Compared with the S-boxes in existing low-latency cipher algorithms, the proposed
    S-box has advantages in both area and latency. Finally, we establish a temperature
    acquisition platform that simulates the environmental monitoring of smart agriculture.
    Then LELBC is applied to the platform to encrypt the collected data, which provides
    the first line of defense for the secure transmission of smart agriculture sensor
    data. 2. Encryption model Smart agriculture mainly uses information technology
    management methods to carry out agricultural production and operations. Its overall
    architecture includes three main parts: the perception layer, the network layer,
    and the application layer [29]. The perception layer can timely acquire and perceive
    environmental factors such as temperature in agricultural production through various
    sensors [30]. These real-time data, including information on personnel and materials
    entering and leaving agricultural greenhouses and data on crop growing sites,
    are uploaded to the IoT information platform through the network layer. Currently,
    all-round environmental monitoring and control systems combining sensors and wireless
    communication networks are widely used and rapidly promoted in facility agriculture.
    However, IoT devices in smart agriculture are susceptible to sensor-based threats
    due to a lack of security measures protecting sensors. Attackers may obtain access
    to perception data so they can monitor or even tamper with related data, damaging
    the confidentiality of the data and posing a serious threat to the proper operation
    and supply of monitoring services [31]. This paper deploys a lightweight block
    cipher, LELBC, at the perception layer to ensure that data is transmitted in ciphertext
    form at the data transmission layer. If the attacker obtains the transmitted data,
    it can only obtain the ciphertext, which cannot be deciphered. Thus, the deployment
    of LELBC in the perception layer ensures the confidentiality of the sensed data
    and establishes the first line of defense for the security of smart agriculture
    IoT devices. The specific encryption application model is shown in Fig. 1. Download

    Encryption application model of smart agriculture. 3. Specification of LELBC This
    section describes the structure of LELBC and the implementation of each component.
    3.1. Encryption algorithm LELBC consists of 16 rounds of encryption, with input
    64-bit plaintext and 128-bit key , and output 64-bit ciphertext . The PSP structure
    of LELBC adopts two symmetrical diffusion layers and Sublayer, which successively
    includes three steps: P diffusion layer, Sublayer and P diffusion layer. Among
    them, the two P-diffusion layers are symmetrical structures, both composed of
    left circular shift and XOR operations. They differ in that the first P diffusion
    layer is left circular shift 5-bit by the left branch data and then XOR with the
    right branch data. The second P diffusion layer is left circular shifted 5-bit
    by the right branch data and then performs an XOR operation with the left branch
    data. The Sublayer consists of 16 4-bit involutive S-boxes, which are identical
    in encryption and decryption. Furthermore, a PN permutation is added after 16
    rounds of round-function iterations to ensure the consistency of the encryption
    and decryption architectures. Some notations used are shown in Table 1. The encryption
    process is shown in Fig. 2 and Algorithm 1. Round-function. The round-function
    process of LELBC in Fig. 2 includes four operations: AddRoundKey, Left circular
    shift, XOR, Sublayer. The number of rounds r is 16. Define the input and output
    of the encryption process as follows: (1) Table 1. Notations of LELBC. Notations

    the high 64-bit ( ) of is taken as input to the two ARK operations. Secondly,
    the first ARK operation takes its high 32-bit data and performs an XOR operation
    with the high 32-bit of plaintext . Finally, the second ARK operation takes its
    lower 32-bit of data and performs an XOR operation with the low 32-bit of plaintext
    . Left circular shift (LCS). The 32-bit plaintext data is cyclically left-shifted.
    The operation is shown in Eq. (2). (2) Download : Download high-res image (135KB)

    Eq. (3). (3) PN permutation (PN). The 64-bit data is divided into two parts, and

    the master key to obtain the encrypted subkey for the first round. After that,
    a key schedule is performed on the subkey of the previous round in each round
    to obtain the subkey of the current round. The data for which key schedules are
    performed in each round can be divided into 32-bit (0 j 3): (5) The key schedule
    consists of the following steps: S-box, round constant addition, and left circular
    shift. (1) Substitute the 4-bit data with the S-box lookup table in Table 2: (6)
    2) The round constant RC=( ) is the current number of rounds minus 1. The round
    constant addition operation is as follows: (7) 3) Left circular shift of the overall
    data by 64-bit: (8) 4) Circular shift the high 64-bit of data to the left by 9-bit,
    and circular shift the low 64-bit of data to the left by 15-bit: (9) 3.3. Decryption
    algorithm The two P-diffusion layers of the PSP structure are symmetric structures,
    and the S-box is involutory in LELBC. Decryption is highly consistent with encryption.
    The difference between decryption and encryption is that the order of the data
    in the decryption subkey is different from that in the encryption subkey. That
    is, the first-round encryption subkey corresponds to the last-round decryption
    subkey. Moreover, and in the encryption subkey correspond to and in the decryption
    subkey, respectively. Algorithm 1 describes the encryption and decryption of LELBC.
    It is easy to see from Algorithm 1 that the steps of encryption and decryption
    are highly identical. Therefore, the decryption can highly reuse the encryption
    structure to achieve low hardware resource consumption, thus achieving low energy
    consumption. 4. Design rationale 4.1. The structure of LELBC In fact, the more
    hardware resources consumed by a cipher algorithm, the more energy it consumes
    [21]. Therefore, considering the limitations of energy resources in smart agriculture,
    the design of low energy cipher algorithms is bound to consider how much hardware
    resources it occupies. Meanwhile, it is necessary for data to be encrypted for
    transmission and decrypted for display in smart agriculture. Usually, unified
    ED circuits are suitable for use in resource-constrained environments where encryption
    and decryption are required. In this case, a highly consistent structure for encryption
    and decryption is the best choice. In addition, it can be known that the energy
    consumption of a round-based architecture is generally optimal from the perspective
    of cipher algorithm implementation. Therefore, we focus on the round-based architecture
    under unified ED circuits. The main design structures for block ciphers include
    the Feistel structure and the SPN structure. The Feistel structure, although similar
    in both encryption and decryption, exhibits poor diffusion and requires more rounds
    to ensure security. The SPN structure has the advantage of fast diffusion. However,
    it consumes more hardware resources to decrypt due to its relatively poor symmetry.
    LELBC has designed a PSP structure based on the SPN structure. The two P-diffusion
    layers in the PSP structure are symmetric, and the S-box is involutory. So the
    decryption can highly reuse the encryption structure to achieve low hardware resource
    consumption, thus achieving a low energy unified ED circuit. Moreover, the structure
    has good diffusivity. Consistent with low energy Midori, LELBC reaches full (bit-level)
    diffusion after 3 rounds. However, the fact that the ShuffleCell of Midori does
    not have the involution property causes it to require two additional multiplexers
    in a unified ED circuit. In contrast, LELBC adopts a PSP structure with encryption–decryption
    consistency in resource-constrained unified ED circuits, and hence LELBC consumes
    less energy and hardware resources than the Midori cipher. 4.2. The non-linear
    layer of LELBC The non-linear layer is a critical component of LELBC cipher. It
    is used to obfuscate data. The performance of S-box is closely related to the
    security of cipher algorithms as it is the most important nonlinear layer in cipher
    algorithms. In the partial security analysis of cipher algorithms, we determine
    whether a cipher algorithm is capable of resisting a corresponding attack precisely
    by solving for the number of minimal active S-boxes in a full-round cipher. Hence,
    the choice of S-boxes with strong cryptographic properties is crucial. In addition,
    low energy consumption is one of the general goals of LELBC. It can be known that
    the area and delay of components also affect the energy consumption of the whole
    algorithm. Low latency and low area contribute to low energy consumption in implementation.
    The area and delay of the S-box, which is the only nonlinear component in LELBC,
    can greatly affect the energy consumption of LELBC. Moreover, the highly consistent
    algorithmic structure of encryption and decryption is conducive to low energy
    implementation. We must adopt an involutive S-box to ensure that the cipher algorithms
    are highly consistent in encryption and decryption. Therefore, we require a low
    area, low latency, and highly secure involutive S-box to achieve low energy consumption
    of cipher algorithms. Compared to the 8 × 8 S-box, the 4 × 4 S-box has less hardware
    resource consumption. Hence, the 4-bit S-box is usually more suitable for the
    design of low energy ciphers than the 8-bit S-box. Now, there are many heuristic
    algorithms applied to the search of S-boxes, and genetic algorithms are one of
    them. The S-box generation algorithms based on genetic algorithms are almost always
    based around security and strong cryptographic properties. They generally use
    differential uniformity, linear approximation, nonlinearity, and other cryptographic
    properties to generate the S-box with strong cryptographic properties. In 2012,
    Wang et al. obtained S-boxes that meet the requirements of differential uniformity,
    linear approximation, nonlinearity, avalanche effect, and other cryptographic
    properties by combining chaos and genetic algorithm [32]. Later, they carried
    out optimization on this basis to generate highly nonlinear bijective S-boxes
    with nonlinearity as the optimization objective [33]. In 2021, a genetic algorithm
    based on a single objective with nonlinearity was used by Çavuşoğlu Ü et al. to
    obtain S-boxes with strong cryptographic properties [34]. In 2022, Artugeer et
    al. also combined chaos and genetic algorithm to generate S-boxes, and they obtained
    S-boxes with higher nonlinearity by optimizing the S-box structure [35]. In addition
    to meeting these cryptographic requirements, the S-box must also satisfy the conditions
    of involution, low area, and low latency, as we require a low-energy, high-security
    S-box. This requires further searching to generate S-boxes based on existing genetic
    algorithm methods. The flowchart for generating S-boxes using genetic algorithm
    is shown in Fig. 3. Our low energy S-box design is required to meet the following
    five conditions: (1) the maximum difference probability is 2−2; (2) the maximum
    absolute deviation of the linear approximation is 2−2; (3) the algebraic degree
    is 3; (4) the depth is less than 4 (the maximum delay of S-box in existing low-latency
    ciphers is 4), and the area is light; (5) involution. The definitions are given
    as follows: Definition 1 Differential Uniformity For a given S-box , define the
    differential distribution of the S-box as: , where is the input differential and
    is the output differential of the S-box. The differential probability . Definition
    2 Linear Approximation For an S-box , define the linear approximation , where
    is the input mask and is the output mask of the S-box. The linear probability
    is obtained by . Definition 3 Algebraic Degree The algebraic degree of a Boolean
    function is defined as the number of variables in the maximum product term in
    the algebraic normal form (ANF) of a function with non-zero coefficients, denoted
    by . The algebraic degree of an S-box is the maximum algebraic number of non-zero
    linear combinations of all its component functions. Therefore, the S-box algebraic
    degree is defined as . Definition 4 Depth The sum of the sequential path delays
    for fundamental operations is depth. Where the depths of the gate required for
    the basic operations XOR/XNOR, AND/OR, NAND/NOR, and NOT are evaluated to be 2,
    1.5, 1, and 0.5, respectively. For example, we consider the computation of in
    Eq. (10). ( ) and ( ) are executed first. Then calculate ( ). Then the last operation
    of NOR can be executed. Thus, the depth of is estimated to be 3.5 (=1.5+1+1).
    The genetic algorithm is used to find low energy S-boxes. The crossover probability
    is 0.8, and the mutation probability is 0.6. The required computation time is
    reduced by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) in S-box generation, and a series of S-boxes
    that meet the conditions can be directly found. The steps for the proposed genetic
    algorithm to find low energy S-boxes are as follows: (1) First, 10,000 individuals
    are randomly generated as the initial population. Download : Download high-res

    are continuously performed on the existing population until the resulting new
    population meets our requirements. After each creation of a new population, the
    following actions are performed on the new population: (1) Calculate the fitness
    values (differential probability, linear approximation probability, and algebraic
    degree) of all individuals in the population by means of a fitness function. (2)
    Effective scaling of the initial fitness. (3) Select the parents with better fitness
    scores from the existing population for processing to generate a new population.
    Among them, the S-box logic operations required to compute algebraic degrees cannot
    be easily obtained since the first step of the algorithm generates 10,000 S-box
    lookup tables with random permutations as the initial population. Hence the Karnaugh
    map method is used to obtain the four simplest logical expressions corresponding
    to the S-box. First, each column is treated as a group, and the S-box lookup table
    is converted into four binary arrays. Then, 0 and 1 are filled in the matrix according
    to the relationship between the different inputs and outputs of the four binary
    arrays to obtain four matrices. The Karnaugh maps are drawn based on these four
    matrices, combining adjacent 1s into the largest set possible and covering as
    many 1s as possible to generate expression terms. Then, the expression terms are
    simplified, and duplicate terms and terms containing other terms are removed to
    generate the complete logical expression. (3) The maximum depth of S-boxes used
    in current low-latency ciphers is 4. Therefore, we keep the depth within 4 for
    searching. It is clear from Definition 4 that in a 4-bit S-box, coordinate components
    with a depth less than 4 are at most a combination of seven 2-input logic gates,
    and the area of each coordinate component is also low at this point. Consequently,
    we can directly traverse the S-boxes obtained in step 2) that satisfy the cryptographic
    properties to search for low-latency and low-area S-boxes. Firstly, we represent
    each coordinate component with a set of 2-input logic gates, respectively (the
    depth is limited to 4). Then, calculate the delay and area of the four coordinate
    components in each S-box, respectively, where the area is calculated under the
    UMC 1P6M process library. Finally, an involutive S-box with low delay and low
    area is obtained. The depth of the S-box is 3.5, and its area is 22.33 GE. Table
    3 shows the performance of the proposed S-box compared with other S-boxes under
    the same process library. It can be seen that the S-box of LELBC has some advantages
    in terms of area and delay. Therefore, it is more capable of achieving low energy
    consumption for LELBC than other S-boxes. The logic gate operation of the S-box
    is represented by Eq. (10). The inputs and outputs are defined as and , where
    and are the most significant bits. (10) 4.3. The linear layer of LELBC A structure
    with highly consistent encryption and decryption is more conducive to low energy
    design. Therefore, LELBC adopts two symmetrical linear layers before and after
    the Sublayer for the diffusion of plaintext data to achieve highly consistent
    encryption and decryption. Although the selection of two identical linear layers
    can better achieve the consistency of encryption and decryption, the diffusion
    effect is not good because the data of the two branches does not affect each other.
    The diffusion effect of this method is also verified by an avalanche effect experiment.
    Table 4 illustrates the avalanche effect of the two linear layers in the first
    5 rounds. represents the average change in output bits when the input plaintext
    changes by 1 bit. The experiment proves that using two symmetrical linear layers
    can achieve a better diffusion effect. Simultaneously, LELBC only needs to add
    an exchange of left and right branch data after 16 rounds of iteration of the
    round function to achieve complete consistency of the encryption and decryption
    structures. Since the S-box is obfuscated in half-byte units, bit diffusion of
    the data is performed using cyclic shifting and XOR operations in the linear layer.
    The selection of the number of cyclic shift bits takes into account both the avalanche
    effect and the security analysis. There are 32 choices, as the cyclically left-shifted
    bits need to be exactly the same in order to achieve a symmetric structure. The
    optimal choice was determined by an experimental test that traversed these 32
    data points. We conducted experiments on the choice of the number of circular
    shifts in combination with differential attacks and avalanche effects. The number
    of rounds at which the cipher algorithm achieves a complete avalanche or the security
    boundary changes with the variation of the bit of circular left shifts, as can
    be seen in Fig. 4. In which rows represent the cyclically left-shifted bits and
    columns represent the round number corresponding to achieving a complete avalanche
    or differential attack security boundary. As some data cannot achieve complete

    effect is a security evaluation method for cryptographic algorithms. The better
    the avalanche effect of the cipher algorithm, the higher the security. In this
    section, the safety strength of this cipher is evaluated by avalanche effect analysis.
    The experiment was conducted by randomly selecting 10,000 sets of 64-bit plaintext
    as test samples. When the input plaintext changes by 1 bit, the avalanche effect
    degree , the strict avalanche criterion degree , the bit of output change , the
    mean value of the bit of output change , the probability of output change and
    the mean probability of output change are tested. Table 5 shows the avalanche
    effect test results for LELBC. At the same time, we use , , and to represent the
    minimum, maximum, and average number of changed bits, respectively. The avalanche
    effect diagram shown in Fig. 5. As seen from Table 5 and Fig. 5, LELBC fully satisfied
    the dependency requirements in the fifth round. In addition, we used the same
    method to test PRESENT and CRAFT, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 6
    and Fig. 7, respectively. Both the PRESENT and CRAFT algorithms reached the avalanche
    effect standard in the sixth round. Therefore, it can be considered that LELBC
    has a good avalanche effect. Table 5. Analysis of avalanche effect of LELBC. Round

    attack and linear attack Differential and linear attacks have been two of the
    most effective cryptographic attack methods since they were proposed. The lower
    bound of the active S-box count can, to some extent, reflect a cipher’s resistance
    to differential and linear attacks. In recent years, automated search has become
    a major focus for cryptanalysis. One of the tools for automating analysis is mixed
    integer linear programming (MILP) [36]. In this paper, the algorithm is analyzed
    using the MILP method. A bit-oriented MILP program is constructed to calculate
    the minimum number of differences and linear active S-boxes. First, we obtain
    the input differential and output differential corresponding to their non-zero
    points according to the difference distribution table (DDT) of LELBC’s S-box.
    It can be seen from Table 10 that the number of non-zero points it has is 97.
    We then obtain 272 inequalities by using the SageMath tool to distinguish all
    non-zero points from other points. Next, we use the MILP procedure to reduce these
    inequalities and eliminate redundancy. The final 21 constrained inequalities are
    obtained to represent the S-box. Finally, we use the Gurobi solver to solve for
    the minimum active S-box number based on the above constraints and the structure
    of the LELBC cipher. The same method is adopted to perform linear attacks on the
    LELBC cipher. The linear approximation table (LAT) for the S-box is shown in Table
    11. Table 6 displays the minimal number of active S-boxes discovered through experimentation.
    It is evident that after 12 rounds of encryption, LELBC has 34 active S-boxes.
    The maximum difference probability and the maximum linear probability should be
    less than 2−64, as the block length of LELBC is 64-bit. Meanwhile, the maximum
    difference probability and the maximum linear probability of the S-box used in
    LELBC are 2−2. It can be observed that the maximum difference probability of LELBC
    in 12 rounds is . The maximum linear probability of LELBC in 12 rounds is . Therefore,
    the 16-round LELBC is resistant to both differential and linear attacks. Table

    5712 5.3. Algebraic attack Algebraic attack is one of the vital methods of cryptanalysis.
    The attacker recovers the key by calculating a number of multivariate algebraic
    equations [37]. The more multivariate algebraic equations there are, the stronger
    the resistance to algebraic attack. These complicated multivariate algebraic equations
    are derived from non-linear S-boxes since they are the most important non-linear
    components of cryptographic algorithms. LELBC has an overall number of (16 × 16)
    + (1 × 16) = 272 S-boxes in the encryption since it has 16 iteration rounds. Twenty-one
    quadratic equations with eight input and output bit variables can be used to describe
    a 4 × 4 S-box. Thus, LELBC has 272 × 21 = 5712 quadratic equations corresponding
    to 272 × 8 = 2176 variables. We compared the differences in the number of S-boxes,
    variables, and quadratic equations between LELBC and KLEIN, Midori, PRINCE, MIBS.
    As can be seen from Table 7, LELBC has a better advantage over most of the cipher
    algorithms, such as Midori, in all these aspects. The Midori cipher algorithm
    has been proven to be resistant to algebraic attack. Therefore, it can be said
    that LELBC is also resistant to algebraic attack. 5.4. Meet-in-the-middle attack
    and slide attack Meet-in-the-Middle attack can be used to analyze the algorithm’s
    security by taking into account three characteristics: partial matching, initial
    structure, and splice-and-cut [38]. Partial matching can only be used when the
    cipher algorithm does not reach full diffusion in both forward and reverse directions.
    Therefore, the total diffusion rounds of LELBC are = 3, as discussed in Section
    4.1, so the boundary of partial matching is = 4. The length of the initial structure
    can also be defined by and the number of rounds in which the key difference affects
    all non-linear operations. Thus, limits the length of the initial structure. Splice-and-cut
    can also limit the number of rounds of attack by subtracting 1 from . In summary,
    the upper bound on the number of rounds that can be attacked by intermediate encounters
    is 10 = (4 + 3 + 3) rounds for LELBC. LELBC is sufficient to resist Meet-in-the-Middle
    attack, considering the total number of rounds of the LELBC algorithm. In addition,
    we ensure that each round of operations is different for LELBC since it includes
    round constant addition in the key schedule. Therefore, LELBC is sufficient to
    resist slide attack. 6. Implementation 6.1. Evaluation This section presents an
    ASIC hardware implementation of LELBC. We adopt a round-based architecture implementation
    for LELBC as it takes less energy than a serialized architecture. First, we implemented
    LELBC with Verilog HDL and simulated it with ModelSim SE-64 10.4. Afterwards,
    LELBC is synthesized using the Synopsys Design Compiler version A-2007.12-SP1
    and the UMCL18G212T3 standard cell library. The architectural diagram of the round-based
    structure of LELBC is illustrated in Fig. 8. In a round-based architecture, the
    LELBC occupies one clock cycle per round. The round function consists of ARK,
    LCS, S, and XOR operations. Additionally, the key schedule consists of S-box,
    round constant addition, and left circular shift. The detailed description of
    the encryption/decryption (ENC/DEC) mode and encryption+decryption (ENC+DEC) mode
    of round-based architectures for LELBC is shown below. The round-based architecture
    (ENC/DEC): The hardware resources and energy consumption of LELBC in encryption
    mode and decryption mode are identical due to the symmetry of the PSP structure.
    For fair comparison, we uniformly use registers to store key and does not take
    into account the resources for the key schedule. The hardware resources of the
    round-based architecture for LELBC include 64-bit plaintext registers, 128-bit
    key registers, 128-bit XOR, 16 S-boxes, control logic and other counters. The
    detailed description of the area consumption for LELBC is given in Table 8. Thus,
    the estimated area of round-based architecture (ENC/DEC) for LELBC is 1863.04
    GE, and energy consumption is 6.99 J/bit. The round-based architecture (ENC+DEC):
    The key schedule of decryption for LELBC under unified ED circuits does not match
    that of encryption. Therefore, the ENC+DEC mode only requires an additional S-box,
    5-bit round constant addition, and a multiplexer on the basis of the ENC/DEC mode.
    Consistent with the ENC/DEC mode, the computation of area and energy in the ENC+DEC
    mode also uniformly uses registers to store the key and does not take into account
    the resources for the key schedule. The comparison of area and energy for LELBC
    with other ciphers in ENC+DEC mode is given in Table 9. It is observed from the
    table that there is a 24.02% and 24.04% reduction in energy and area for LELBC
    compared to Midori, a low-energy cipher published in ASIACRYPT 2015. It is possible
    that this reduction in energy and area could allow LELBC to be applicable in a
    future where IoT devices are more resource-constrained. LELBC could reduce the
    energy loss of each resource-constrained device to a greater extent in practical
    IoT deployments, increasing their lifespan and reducing the replacement cycle
    of the devices. From a long-term perspective, the reduced energy consumption in
    practical IoT deployments is conducive to increasing the availability of IoT devices
    in smart agriculture and reducing economic losses. Simultaneously, smart agriculture
    can utilize energy more efficiently and rationally and facilitate the balanced
    development of the environment and the economy. Download : Download high-res image

    popular in facility agriculture due to all-round environmental monitoring and
    control systems that combine sensors and wireless communication networks. Environmental
    data and on-site scenario information in agriculture are collected and transmitted
    through various wireless sensors to liquid crystal display screens for comprehensive
    display, achieving scientific, timely, and accurate adjustment of agricultural
    production. However, as more and more farms and food processing plants adopt new
    technologies to simplify production and integrate supply chain services, cybercrime
    is becoming an increasingly serious threat to agricultural enterprises. Therefore,
    encrypting sensor data in smart agriculture has a certain significance. Temperature
    is an important factor in the growth and development of crops in agriculture,
    and real-time monitoring of temperature is conducive to the timely adjustment
    of the appropriate temperature state. In this section, a temperature acquisition
    platform was established to simulate environmental monitoring in smart agriculture.
    At the same time, we deployed the 64–128 versions of LELBC on the temperature
    acquisition platform. LELBC simulates data acquisition and encrypted transmission
    in agriculture through temperature sensors and two Artix-7 FPGA development boards
    based on XC7A100T2csg324. We synthesized the RTL generated by LELBC based on the
    round architecture using ISE Design Suite 14.6 and downloaded it onto an Artix-7
    FPGA development board based on the XC7A100T-2csg324. Firstly, an Artix-7 FPGA
    development board acquires real-time temperature data through the temperature
    sensor. It then encrypts and displays the data through the downloaded LELBC. After
    that, the data is transmitted to another Artix-7 FPGA development board in the
    form of ciphertext to be decrypted and displayed. The specific process is shown
    in Fig. 9. The Artix-7 FPGA development board on the right encrypts the collected
    temperature data and displays it, while the Artix-7 FPGA development board on
    the left displays the temperature data after the ciphertext is decrypted. LELBC
    provides encryption of the sensed data before transmission, which ensures that
    the data is kept in the form of ciphertext at all times during transmission. It
    protects the confidentiality of the data by preventing attackers from stealing,
    tampering with, and leaking the real data. The successful implementation of a
    real-time temperature status acquisition and encryption platform demonstrates
    the feasibility of deploying LELBC on the platform. It provides the first line
    of defense for data security in smart agriculture. Download : Download high-res

    and encryption platform. 7. Conclusion The focus of this paper is to design a
    low energy lightweight block cipher LELBC that meets the requirements of an environment
    with extremely limited energy resources. Firstly, we studied the design methods
    of low energy ciphers and optimized them based on the shortcomings of existing
    low energy ciphers. LELBC adopts a novel PSP structure with highly consistent
    encryption and decryption, which takes into account the energy resource constraints
    of unified ED circuits during the design phase. Additionally, GA is used to search
    for a low-energy involutive S-box with excellent performance compared to other
    cipher involutive S-boxes. In terms of hardware implementation on a round-based
    architecture, LELBC has a lower area and energy consumption (encryption + decryption)
    than low energy lightweight ciphers such as PRINCE, Loong, CRAFT, I-PRESENT ,
    SKINNY, and Midori. The test vectors for LELBC are given in Table 12. LELBC has
    been demonstrated by security analysis to be resistant to attacks such as differential
    attack, linear attack, algebraic attack, and other types of attacks. Finally,
    LELBC is deployed on the temperature acquisition platform to encrypt and decrypt
    the sensor data. The successful implementation of this experiment proves the feasibility
    of LELBC, which provides the first layer of protection for the privacy and security
    of smart agriculture. Future works: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Side Channel
    Attacks (SCAs) are two of the most important topics in security. In the future,
    we will also delve into these two directions. First, there is a need for a hybrid
    system for the transition towards PQC, although quantum computing based on Shor’s
    algorithm will break most cryptosystems [39]. This hybrid system requires both
    classical cryptography and PQC [40]. Many related techniques are continuously
    proposed [41], [42]. They usually optimize the performance of the algorithms according
    to the NIST standard [43], [44]. In the future, we can further study the relevant
    applications of PQC in resource-constrained environments such as smart agriculture.

    EE1E-96B3-C248-F88D Second, the fault attack is specifically mentioned in the
    NIST lightweight standardization as a side channel attack. It works by forcing
    a device to operate under extreme conditions, resulting in computational errors.
    It is necessary to consider the possibility of fault attacks in practical applications,
    even though the attackers are generally restricted [45]. A number of error detection
    schemes for cipher algorithms have been proposed [46], [47]. For example, Jasmin
    Kaur et al. proposed signature-based error detection schemes that can be applied
    to cipher algorithms similar to the QARMA cipher [13]. And the overhead of this
    method can be applied to resource-constrained devices. LELBC has similarities
    with QARMA both in terms of block length, structure, and components. In future
    practical deployments, we can also refer to this scheme to secure the LELBC hardware
    implementation. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they

  description: Industrial greenhouse mushroom cultivation is currently promising,
    due to the nutritious and commercial mushroom benefits and its convenience in
    adapting smart agriculture technologies. Traditional Device-Cloud protocol in
    smart agriculture wastes network resources when big data from Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices are directly transmitted to the cloud server without processing,
    delaying network connection and increasing costs. Edge computing has emerged to
    bridge these gaps by shifting partial data storage and computation capability
    from the cloud server to edge devices. However, selecting which tasks can be applied
    in edge computing depends on user-specific demands, suggesting the necessity to
    design a suitable Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS) architecture for
    single-crop requirements. This study aims to design and implement a cost-saving
    multilayered SAIS architecture customized for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation
    toward leveraging edge computing. A three-layer SAIS adopting the Device-Edge-Cloud
    protocol, which enables the integration of key environmental parameter data collected
    from the IoT sensor and RGB images collected from the camera, was tested in this
    research. Implementation of this designed SAIS architecture with typical examples
    of mushroom cultivation indicated that low-cost data pre-processing procedures
    including small-data storage, temporal resampling-based data reduction, and lightweight
    artificial intelligence (AI)-based data quality control (for anomalous environmental
    conditions detection) together with real-time AI model deployment (for mushroom
    detection) are compatible with edge computing. Integrating the Edge Layer as the
    center of the traditional protocol can significantly save network resources and
    operational costs by reducing unnecessary data sent from the device to the cloud,
    while keeping sufficient information.

    Industrial greenhouse mushroom cultivation is currently promising, due to the

    agriculture technologies. Traditional Device-Cloud protocol in smart agriculture
    wastes network resources when big data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices are
    directly transmitted to the cloud server without processing, delaying network

    This study aims to design and implement a cost-saving multilayered SAIS architecture
    customized for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation toward leveraging edge computing.
    A three-layer SAIS adopting the Device-Edge-Cloud protocol, which enables the

    Keywords: smart agriculture; mushroom; edge computing; farm management information
    system (FMIS); machine vision; Agricultural IoT 1. Introduction Nowadays, edible
    mushrooms are well known as not only a healthy food but also a valuable pharmacy,
    since they can provide rich nutrients such as protein, minerals, and vitamins
    as well as increase the human immune system to prevent many diseases, even cancer
    [1,2]. Therefore, the demand for mushroom products is increasing in the world’s
    food market, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic [3,4]. Although wild mushrooms
    can be harvested in the natural environment, their high sensitivity to seasonal
    variations of weather/climate factors leads to unsustainable production [5,6].
    Industrialized mushroom cultivation in the greenhouse offers an alternative strategy
    to natural cultivation to improve both the quantity and quality of mushroom production
    because the key environmental parameters affecting mushroom growth can be monitored
    and controlled. However, the traditional cultivation method based on manual monitoring,
    controlling, and harvesting involves time-consuming and labor-intensive work which
    can then increase operational costs, demanding timely, automated, cost-effective,
    and eco-friendly solutions for the mushroom industry [7,8]. Along with the Fourth
    Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) when innovative technologies such as the
    Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data (BD), and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) have been commonly employed in industrial automation, a parallel revolution
    in agriculture (Agriculture 4.0) boosts automation in farming activities by applying
    those new technologies to the agriculture sector, so-called smart agriculture/farming
    (or precision agriculture, digital agriculture, and Agricultural IoT). Although
    it can contribute to the reduction in labor costs, deploying smart agriculture
    systems in practice is facing other cost-related problems such as setup costs
    and running costs [9]. On the one hand, from the users’ point of view, especially
    in some developing countries where most people working in agriculture are smallholder
    farmers, they have limited access to modern smart farming infrastructure due to
    the expensive product prices (setup costs). On the other hand, from the perspective
    of service developers/providers, smart farming system construction and applications,
    which are commonly implemented in centralized cloud servers can consume massive
    resources for BD storage, management, analytics, and security, resulting in higher
    overall cloud service costs (running costs). Cutting those unnecessary costs is
    therefore pivotal for many business organizations, especially small and medium
    enterprises (SMEs), to optimize their smart farming systems toward serving smallholder
    clients with cost-saving infrastructures. Besides the cloud service costs, traditional
    smart agriculture systems are often limited by the slow network connection (low
    bandwidth) between Agricultural IoT devices and cloud servers when all the huge
    numbers of data collected from the devices are directly sent to the cloud, which
    then delays the system decisions and hampers real-time applications in smart agriculture
    (high latency) [10,11,12]. This is a challenge for mushroom cultivation when its
    key parameters require strict monitoring within short time intervals [13]. Edge
    computing (including cloudlets, fog, and mobile edge computing) has recently emerged
    as a promising solution to bridge this connection gap, thanks to the rapid advancement
    of information and communication technologies as well as hardware capacity. Specifically,
    an edge computing node can be regarded as a decentralized local server (edge server)
    that allows for storing a small number of data and bringing data computation closer
    to the edge devices [14,15,16]. By coupling the edge computing paradigm with a
    classical Device-Cloud protocol, the original BD is effectively managed in an
    offline process at the edge server before transmission instead of storing and
    processing all the collected raw data at the cloud server [17]. This can free
    up the bandwidth for faster connection and for the cloud server load spent on
    complicated analytics and applications [16,18]. Despite the wide deployment of
    edge computing in smart homes and smart cities, it is not very commonplace in
    smart farming, and thus there is still room for leveraging and improving this
    paradigm to meet the demands of smart agriculture as well as the greenhouse mushroom
    industry. Shifting partial work from cloud to edge offers SMEs an effective and
    cost-saving solution to overcome the issues of excessive bandwidth-cloud utilization
    and high latency [10]. However, determining which features should be conducted
    in the edge server highly depends on the specific functional requirements and
    capacity of each smart farming system [19]. This suggests the necessity to design
    a proper digital Farm Management Information System (FMIS) architecture assisting
    smart agriculture applications for the specific farmer’s requirements (e.g., for
    each different crop) [20,21,22], hereafter the Smart Agriculture Information System
    (SAIS). From the perspective of an SME, Sejong Rain Company in collaboration with
    Chungnam National University aims to design and implement a low-cost SAIS architecture
    customized for smart greenhouse mushroom management in association with a paradigm
    shift to edge computing for business objectives, in this article. This system
    was tested in a pilot site located in Songsan Green City, Republic of Korea. The
    advanced Agricultural IoT sensors developed by Korean companies, a standard network
    flow that is possible for scalability, and edge computing tasks suitable for greenhouse
    mushroom cultivation, together with examples of how to implement them, were introduced
    through the proposed SAIS architecture. Finally, a potential SAIS architecture
    for business purposes in future studies was also suggested, especially for the
    developing country markets that consider smart agriculture development as the
    core industry. 2. Background and Related Work 2.1. Smart Agriculture Information
    System (SAIS) The traditional FMIS, which relied on simple farm recordkeeping
    tasks, has been developed since the 1970s to provide useful information for decision-makers
    to effectively manage farming activities [23]. However, in the era of Agriculture
    4.0 nowadays, the adoption of a traditional FMIS is limited when massive data
    are provided from the IoT sensors and complex tasks are required for modern farm
    management [24,25]. To cope with the rapid increase of agricultural data pools
    and data-driven farming applications, the SAIS, whose cornerstone is the large
    digital FMIS specialized for precision agriculture, can improve the automation
    and efficiency in managing enormous amounts of farming information including data
    collection, data processing, and data-driven decision making [20,25]. Although
    the core of the SAIS is the multi-layered architecture comprising four basic components
    of Smart Product, Network Connection, Data, and Smart Service [22], recent studies
    paid more attention to adapting this core SAIS to the domain-specific uses by
    breaking it into higher-level architectures, ranging from the classical three-
    or four-layer up to the advanced seven- or eight-layer architectures. Among the
    classical architectures, the three-layer one, which corresponds to the two-layer
    without the Network Layer, refers to the Device-Cloud protocol where the raw data
    obtained by sensors will be directly transmitted to the cloud for storage, processing,
    and applications. The four-layer architecture (three-layer without the Network
    Layer) can allow edge computing to involve those cloud tasks. Integrating a separate
    layer of edge computing into SAIS architectures is also gaining attraction and
    possibly becoming a trending paradigm in future studies [17]. Additionally, advanced
    architectures improved on the classical ones for business objectives by proposing
    enterprise architecture by adding new layers such as the Business, User, or Security
    Layers [26]. For more details, the readers are referred to the literature reviews
    of different multi-layered SAISs in previous studies, summarized in Table 1. Table
    1. Literature reviews of multi-layered Smart Agriculture Information Systems.
    2.2. Smart Greenhouse Mushroom Cultivation Aside from the benefits for human health
    and commerce, edible mushrooms are currently becoming the preferred crop for indoor
    cultivation, even in urban farming, because they are easily relocated, do not
    require large space and direct sunlight, and need only a short duration until
    harvesting [35]. However, the major limitation came from the high sensitivity
    of mushrooms to the surrounding environment, since extreme weather conditions
    can immediately damage mushroom health. Therefore, the most important task of
    indoor mushroom cultivation relies on the timely and continuous control of the
    key environmental parameters’ ideal conditions at every mushroom growing stage
    [36]. Previous studies listed a wide range of those key parameters [13], but the
    two most important ones that are worth regarding are air temperature and humidity,
    while several studies further considered light intensity or carbon dioxide (CO2)
    levels. The ideal ranges for these parameters vary depending on different mushroom
    species [7,37], and they can be easily, timely, and automatically observed and
    controlled in the greenhouse using IoT sensors, which have been widely reported
    in the literature as the common approach for indoor mushroom management. Alongside
    the development of computer vision and precision agriculture technologies, high-resolution
    cameras associated with AI-based image processing have been successfully applied
    in the mushroom industry to enhance management accuracy and efficiency [38]. Current
    advances improved by combining the advantages of IoT sensors and camera computer
    vision, which opens a new door for future smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation
    in particular and smart agriculture in general. Literature reviews of smart greenhouse
    mushroom management using IoT sensors, cameras, and integrated IoT sensor-camera
    systems are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Literature reviews of smart greenhouse
    mushroom management. 3. System Architecture Design Based on the potential of the
    SAIS with edge computing and the increased need for mushroom products, this study
    aims to design and implement a multi-layered SAIS architecture with leveraging
    edge computing for cost-effective smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation. In particular,
    an integrated IoT environmental sensor-camera system and the oyster mushroom were
    selected to test in this study. To highlight the capability of coupling the edge
    computing model to the classical Device-Cloud protocol, a general three-layer
    SAIS architecture (without the Network Layer), which adopted the Edge Layer as
    a bridge for the Device and Cloud (Device-Edge-Cloud protocol), was employed.
    Moreover, we also suggested the integration of a bidirectional (two-way) communication
    mechanism in this system to separate the network flow into two major domains for
    different functional tasks, including the Forward and Backward Domains. In each
    layer, two modules were included to respond to separated functional tasks in the
    Forward and Backward Domains, respectively. The proposed SAIS architecture applied
    to greenhouse mushroom management in this paper is depicted in Figure 1. Specifically,
    according to Figure 1, the Forward Domain enables data transmission from the Device
    Layer (Data Collecting module) through the Edge Layer for quality control and
    aggregation (Data Preprocessing module), and then to the Cloud Layer (Data Storage
    module). In contrast, the Backward Domain allows an inverse direction that AI-based
    solutions developed at the Cloud Layer using stored data (Data Analytics/AI Development
    module) to be deployed at the Edge Layer for real-time applications (Real-time
    AI Deployment module), then to control the ideal conditions of the environmental
    parameters if necessary via controlling actuators/sensors at the Device Layer
    (Device Controlling module). The Forward Domain is responsible for the data management
    and storage tasks while the Backward Domain is responsible for the solutions development
    and decision-making based on the obtained data. In this study, we describe the
    proposed architecture following its network flow and focus especially on the Forward
    Domain, since it is the mainstream in the SAIS. It is important to note that although
    the Network/Communication Layer which encompasses the protocols for network connection
    is also important and was already employed in this paper, we did not focus on
    modifying this layer, so it was not mentioned here as a major layer. A detailed
    description of the proposed SAIS architecture and its implementation for smart
    greenhouse mushroom management at the testbed site is provided below. Figure 1.

    for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation. The blue dashed border and arrows indicate
    the Forward Domain and its procedure, and the red dashed border and arrows indicate
    the Backward Domain and its procedure. 3.1. Forward Domain–Device Layer The Device
    Layer is the first layer in this proposed SAIS architecture, which enables a workspace
    for Agricultural IoT end devices. In this layer, the Data Collecting module is
    particularly responsible for the Forward Domain. Its detailed architecture is
    presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. The architecture of the Forward Domain in the
    Device Layer. Data Collecting: This module aims to collect farming and environmental
    data observed from the IoT sensors system. Since the integrated IoT environmental
    sensor-camera system was employed, this module was separated into two sub-modules
    for better management, consisting of (1) the one-dimensional (1D) Data sub-module
    which stands for point environmental data collected from the IoT sensors, and
    (2) the two-dimensional (2D) Data sub-module, which stands for image data collected
    from the cameras. 1-Dimensional Data (1): This sub-module offers a workspace for
    the point IoT sensors to collect the environmental data time series. Because temperature,
    humidity, and CO2 are generally the key environmental parameters for mushroom
    growth in the literature, they were considered in this system. A three-in-one
    IoT environmental sensor, which measures automatically and simultaneously the
    three key parameters of temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and CO2 levels
    (CO2) in real-time using only one sensor, was adopted in this study. This low-cost
    combination sensor is a domestic Korean product that was researched and developed
    by the Sejong Rain Company, Republic of Korea, and is currently being tested before
    commercialization. Even though this combination sensor can observe real-time data,
    the maximum 10 min time resolution has been set to be updated in this sub-module.
    For more information or inquiries on this combination IoT sensor, please refer
    to the company homepage (http://sejongrain.com/, accessed on 10 January 2024).
    Its photos and specifications are shown in Figure 3a,b, and Table 3, respectively.
    Two-Dimensional Data (2): Besides the IoT environmental sensor, this system uses
    a surveillance camera system to collect crop image/video (time series of RGB images)
    data, which enhances automation in intuitive recognition of mushroom characteristics
    (e.g., shapes, colors, species, phenological stages, or related diseases) and
    was implemented in this sub-module. Specifically, an industrial high-definition
    (HD 720p) digital camera (model SMT-720PUSBBOX) manufactured by Smtkey Electronic
    Technology Company, Shenzhen Guangdong, China, was employed to provide streaming
    images/video of the oyster mushroom. However, to match the temporal resolution
    of the environmental sensor, the camera system was set to capture image time series
    at 10 min intervals in single red (R), green (G), and blue (B) bands. A photo
    of the camera used is shown in Figure 3c and its specifications are presented
    in Table 4. Figure 3. Photos of the combination IoT environmental sensor: (a)
    displaying temperature and humidity and (b) displaying CO2 level; and (c) photo
    of the surveillance camera used in this study. The Korean word in the IoT combination
    sensor label is the name of the company who develops this device, the Sejong Rain
    Company, Republic of Korea. Table 3. Specifications of the combination IoT environmental
    sensor used. Table 4. Specifications of the surveillance camera used. 3.2. Forward
    Domain–Edge Layer The Edge Layer or edge server is a middle layer in this proposed
    three-layer SAIS, where edge computing is executed, and is the major part of this
    study. It is important to note that edge computing is not a replacement for traditional
    cloud computing, but that it is a complement for cloud computing. Edge computing
    is normally conducted in low-memory and low-power microprocessors and assigned
    for small workloads with lightweight computation, which fits in with real-time
    AI applications. In contrast, cloud computing is compatible with smart solutions
    requiring BD and heavy computation capacity. Therefore, a powerful, low-energy-consumption,
    and cost-effective Raspberry Pi single-board computer was used in this study for
    edge computing in both Forward and Backward Domains. In particular, the Raspberry
    Pi 3 Model B+, which also provides a high-speed processor suitable for HD video
    processing and dual connections via both WiFi (wireless) and Ethernet port (wired),
    was employed in the system. For a more detailed description of its specifications,
    users are referred to the company’s website (https://www.raspberrypi.com/, accessed
    on 10 January 2024). The related tasks are shown in the Data Preprocessing module
    for the Forward Domain, and its architecture is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4.
    The architecture of the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer. Data Preprocessing:
    It is important to note that not all the raw data should be stored in the cloud.
    Selecting essential data for the cloud can save resources by decreasing cloud
    and bandwidth workloads. Hence, the main mission of this module is to reduce the
    number of raw data observed from the Device Layer while keeping data quality before
    sending them to the Cloud Layer, based on the following sub-modules for preprocessing:
    Small-Data Storage (1): Since a previous study indicated the effective greenhouse
    mushroom monitoring on an hourly basis [13], we also set a one-hour (1 h) interval
    as the standard temporal resolution to be sent to the cloud and for mushroom cultivation
    in this study. To this end, several raw data should be stored in the Edge Layer
    for further temporal data resampling and quality control development. Temporal
    Resampling (2): The temporal resampling applied in this sub-module aims to convert
    the 10 min raw data into hourly data and relies on a simple Average Filtering
    method, whereas the six raw data samples within every 1h interval stored in the
    Small-Data Storage sub-module will be transferred to this sub-module for averaging
    into one data sample. This method can be applied to both 1D and 2D data in this
    SAIS and may help it reduce the number of data together with overcoming the temporal
    gaps (missing data) that occurred at the original 10 min interval. Data Quality
    Control (3): Despite the benefit of temporal resampling in dealing with the gaps
    in raw data time series, the resampled data still probably suffer from temporal
    gaps (when six raw data samples are missing values) or sudden extreme conditions.
    This requires an AI-based data quality control filter that can not only automatically
    and continuously detect such outliers in the data stream, but also has a low computational
    cost when it is applied to the Edge Layer. Even though several lightweight AI
    models are compatible with edge/fog computing, the well-known k-nearest neighbors
    (k-NN) algorithm was used for showcasing in this research. The k-NN is simply
    a non-parametric supervised learning method, which considers k samples of training
    data to solve the classification and regression problems, but it can be regarded
    as an unsupervised learning algorithm when it is applied to anomaly detection
    [50]. The k-NN integrated with a 24 h moving window was applied in this study
    to identify whether real-time data are anomalous or not, based on the lagged 23h
    data samples stored in the Small-Data Storage sub-module. Whenever the ksample
    is detected and masked, it can be continuously used to identify the (k + 1) sample,
    and the (k − 23) sample is then automatically removed from the Small-Data Storage
    sub-module. This AI-based data quality control filter can be applied to both 1D
    and 2D data. For 1D data, besides transmitting them to the Cloud Layer for long-term
    storage, the processed data were also sent to a responsive module of the Backward
    Domain in the Edge Layer to support the system’s real-time decision-making. However,
    in the case of 2D data, to reduce the high computational cost when processing
    image data, the RGB images obtained from the camera were first converted to grayscale
    images and then transformed to 1D format by simply averaging the digital number
    (DN) values within an image scene (scene-averaging) before they can be applied,
    with the data quality control filter. Anomalous DN data samples closer to 0 can
    be identified as temporal gaps (black images), while those with high values (e.g.,
    higher than 80—a typical average grayscale digital number value) can be classified
    as light images, which still provide useful information. The quality-controlled
    image data on an hourly basis were sent only to the Cloud Layer. 3.3. Forward
    Domain–Cloud Layer The Cloud Layer is the final layer in this proposed SAIS, which
    is widely used in various architectures and allows high computational application
    development based on the quality-controlled BD. Hence, the Forward Domain offers
    long-term high-quality data to be stored firstly in the Cloud Layer under the
    Data Storage module management. Data Storage: Because the accuracy of AI models
    significantly depends on the quality and quantity of the training data, this module
    aims to provide a space to store long-term (e.g., one life cycle of mushrooms)
    high-quality data observed from the integrated environmental sensor-camera system
    to develop AI-based solutions which require a high computation cost. These necessary
    datasets stored in this module can be then transmitted to the responsive module
    of the Backward Domain in the Cloud Layer for training AI models with respect
    to specific user requirements. 3.4. Backward Domain–Cloud Layer As highlighted
    in the description above, the mission of the Backward Domain is to develop AI-based
    smart solutions and make decisions based on the collected and stored data in the
    Forward Domain. Therefore, in the Cloud Layer, the Backward Domain tasks are conducted
    in the AI Development module. Figure 5 presents the architecture of the Backward
    Domain in the Cloud Layer. Figure 5. The architecture of the Backward Domain in
    the Cloud Layer. AI Development: This module is designed to account for AI-based
    smart solution development for specific demands, which requires BD for high computational
    cost training and complex analytics. The implementation of this module in the
    Backward Domain of the Cloud Layer follows the two sub-modules: AI Model Training
    (1): This sub-module includes the feature selection task for training AI models
    based on user-specific demands, whereas relevant important features were extracted
    from the BD in the Data Storage module. Furthermore, several well-known AI model
    candidates will be selected for training. Parameter Storage (2): The optimal AI
    model among the candidates was chosen and its optimal parameters were then stored
    in this sub-module for further deployment. Various AI-based smart greenhouse mushroom-cultivation
    solutions can be considered for development. However, to showcase only one example
    of the high-computational-cost AI model application with BD (mostly with image/video
    data) in the Cloud Layer, a well-known, fast, effective, and advanced computer
    vision algorithm version among the series of the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO) framework
    [51], the YOLOv5 model, was used in this study for real-time mushroom detection
    with a surveillance camera. Specifically, the YOLOv5 model, whose cornerstone
    is a simple deep convolutional neural network, was introduced in 2020 to improve
    on its predecessors in object detection. The YOLOv5 model divides images into
    a grid cell and finally predicts the objects with multiple bounding boxes per
    grid cell. Its architecture consists of three main components: the BackBone for
    feature extraction, the Neck for feature fusion, and the Head for feature conversion
    to bounding-box parameters. The BD images stored in the Big-Data Storage module
    can be labeled for training the YOLOv5 model. To reduce the training costs (including
    the training time and number of training-data samples), this study adopted the
    Transfer Learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv5 model for mushroom
    detection to be compatible with the current training mushroom images in the Big-Data
    Storage module. The optimal model parameters were stored in the Parameter Storage
    sub-module and then transferred to the Edge Layer for real-time deployment. 3.5.
    Backward Domain–Edge Layer The Backward Domain in the Edge Layer provides the
    workspace for real-time smart agriculture solution deployment, which was assigned
    to the Real-time AI Deployment module, with its architecture provided in Figure
    6. Figure 6. The architecture of the Backward Domain in the Edge Layer. Real-time
    AI Deployment: This module consists of four sub-modules for integrating analytics
    from both environmental sensors and cameras to improve real-time solution/decision
    making, as follows: Short-term Analytics (1): This sub-module receives the analytical
    results from the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer (Data Preprocessing module),
    mainly based on temporary small-data storage of the 1D data from the IoT environmental
    sensor. Long-term Analytics (2): The optimal AI model obtained from the Backward
    Domain based on BD analytics in the Cloud Layer (AI Development module) was deployed
    in this sub-module, mainly for the 2D image data. Integrated Analytics (3): This
    sub-module combines the analytical results from the Short-term and Long-term Analytics
    sub-modules to enhance decision-making. Solutions/Decision Making (4): Relevant
    solutions/decisions will be made in this sub-module, based on the results from
    the Integrated Analytics sub-module. 3.6. Backward Domain–Device Layer The Backward
    Domain in the Device Layer covers the Device Controlling module. Device Controlling:
    This module aims to automatically control sensors/actuators to make farm management
    decisions as soon as possible, based on the analytical solutions provided by the
    Real-time AI Deployment module in the Edge Layer. For example, the image-based
    mushroom detection solution allows users to recognize whether the mushrooms are
    currently in the growing period or have been harvested. In the case of extreme
    conditions observed by the environmental sensor during the mushroom growing period,
    this module enables the modulating of key environmental parameters by controlling
    IoT sensors/actuators such as the heater/cooling fan (for temperature), humidifier/dehumidifier
    (for humidity), or air ventilation (for CO2 level) via connection to a microcontroller.
    4. Implementation Results 4.1. Implementation of Forward Domain–Device Layer Installation
    of the integrated IoT environmental sensor-surveillance camera system for smart
    greenhouse mushroom cultivation is the first implementation step and was carried
    out in a mushroom house located in Songsan Green City, Republic of Korea. This
    system aims to collect the key environmental parameters affecting mushroom growth
    and intuitive mushroom information, which is the responsibility of the Data Collecting
    module belonging to the Forward Domain in the Device Layer. Figure 7 describes
    the installation of the combination IoT environmental sensor for simultaneously
    measuring the real-time 1D data of three key environmental parameters including
    air temperature (T), atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and CO2 level (CO2),
    together with the construction of a data logger containing the Raspberry Pi single-board
    computer. Data collected from the IoT environmental sensor were then transmitted
    to the data logger for further processing, mainly via a wireless connection (Figure
    7a). However, we also set up ethernet cables here to ensure that data transmission
    can be automatically switched to a wired connection when the wireless connection
    collapses, maintaining their stable transmission (Figure 7b). It is important
    to note that although the environmental sensor was set up in the greenhouse environment,
    we constructed the data logger outside the mushroom house for future combination
    with outdoor smart agriculture sensors/actuators such as smart precipitation gauges,
    unmanned aerial vehicles, tractors, and so on (Figure 7c). Figure 7. Installation
    of the combination IoT environmental sensor for the greenhouse mushroom information
    system with connection to data logger via the following: (a) wireless connection
    and (b) wired connection. (c) Construction of data logger outdoors with potential
    combination with outdoor sensors. The Korean words in the label of the data logger
    represent for the system name “Agriculture Environment Data Collection System”
    and the company name “Sejong Rain”. The time series of the raw 1D data (at 10
    min of temporal resolution) for the three key parameters from the installed IoT
    environmental sensor for nearly one month (one life cycle of the mushroom) is
    depicted in Figure 8. In general, no major operational errors occurred when continuous
    data were collected without missing values and the observed data range fell within
    the sensor’s allowable measuring range for each parameter, according to Table
    3. This suggests that the combination IoT environmental sensor used in this study,
    which was developed by the Korean company, is ready and has potential for smart
    mushroom monitoring and further applications in smart agriculture. Figure 8. Time
    series of 1D raw data in 10 min intervals collected from the combination IoT environmental
    sensor for (a) temperature (T), (b) humidity (RH), and (c) CO2 level (CO2). Besides
    the IoT environmental sensor, the simultaneous installation of the surveillance
    camera to capture real-time intuitive 2D data for crop information was also implemented
    in the pilot area, as illustrated in Figure 9. The camera was fixed to collect
    a time series of RGB images covering a partial mushroom farm for preliminary testing.
    We also connected the camera system to the data logger for data transmission.
    Figure 9. Installation of the surveillance camera for the greenhouse-mushroom
    information system. Time series of the raw 2D data at 10 min time intervals were
    obtained from the installed surveillance camera. We showcase several RGB image
    samples of mushrooms at different growth stages in Figure 10. It can be drawn
    from Figure 10 that intuitive mushroom information can be well captured by the
    installed surveillance camera, even with the changes between growth stages. However,
    there are several temporal gaps (image samples with no-value/black images) that
    occurred during the operation which need to be noticed and addressed. All the
    raw data collected in the Device Layer were then sent to the Edge Layer for pre-processing.
    Figure 10. Samples of 2D raw data in 10 min intervals collected from the surveillance
    camera during different mushroom growth stages. The red rectangle highlights the
    gap (no-value data) in the data stream. 4.2. Implementation of Forward Domain–Edge
    Layer The raw 1D and 2D data collected at the Device Layer were then delivered
    to the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer for further preprocessing before being
    transmitted to the Cloud Layer. The Edge Layer is the major layer in this designed
    SAIS, whose main goal is a stepping stone toward saving cloud and bandwidth resources
    as well as selecting essential data for the cloud server. Therefore, the Forward
    Domain in this layer (represented by the Data Preprocessing module) is responsible
    for reducing unnecessary data collected from the Device Layer and conducting quality
    control for high-quality data sent to the Cloud Layer. To this end, several raw
    data samples (small data) should be stored in this layer for a short period and
    the Small-Data Storage sub-module is responsible for providing storage space in
    this task. The first preprocessing task in this module is data reduction. Since
    the mushroom monitoring on an hourly basis is sufficient and was selected as the
    standard temporal resolution to be updated in the cloud, an average filtering
    technique was utilized as the temporal resampling method to convert 10 min data
    into 1h data. Figure 11 illustrates examples of how to conduct this temporal resampling
    method in both 1D and 2D data time series. In particular, every six raw data samples/images
    within a current 1h duration were initially stored. Since no significant differences
    were observed among these raw data, an hourly representative point value/image
    can be generated by simply taking an average of those six data samples/images.
    After an hourly representative data sample/image is given, it will be sent back
    to the Small-Data Storage sub-module for temporal storage and the current raw
    data will be automatically removed from this sub-module for updating the coming
    raw data. It is important to note that, besides the data reduction benefit, this
    method also supports dealing with temporal gap problems, ensuring continuous measurement
    of the data stream. For example, a black image (temporal gap) that occurred in
    the raw 2D data was successfully removed and replaced by a representative image
    (average image of the six raw data in 10 min intervals within every 1h interval)
    while keeping sufficient information, as illustrated in Figure 11b. Figure 11.
    Examples of the temporal resampling based on the average filtering method to resample
    raw data in 10 min intervals into standard data in 1h intervals applied to the
    following: (a) 1D data from the environmental sensor and (b) 2D data from the
    camera. The red dashed rectangle represents the 1h data window. The second preprocessing
    task in the Forward Domain of the Edge Layer is for data quality control, which
    is covered by the Data Quality Controlling sub-module. For the 1D data, since
    the important task of smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation is mainly based on
    modulating the ideal conditions of key environmental parameters, this sub-module
    aims to determine the sudden extreme conditions occurring in the environmental
    data, supporting the system with timely responses to address the problems as well
    as managing high-quality data sent to the cloud server. However, because edge
    computing is compatible with light computing applications that can work well in
    short-term small-data numbers stored in this layer, effective and lightweight
    AI algorithms are preferable for this task. As a result, a widely used lightweight
    AI model, the k-NN algorithm, was selected as the anomaly-detection method in
    this study. More specifically, the k-NN was conducted in a 24h moving window (k
    = 23) for the continuous hourly data samples stored in the Small-Data Storage.
    The real-time outlier detection of the current data sample (the k sample) can
    be performed based on its recent 23 lagged hourly data samples. Whenever the k
    sample is detected and masked, it can be continuously used to identify the (k
    + 1) sample, and the (k − 23) sample is automatically deleted from the Small-Data
    Storage sub-module. Figure 12 presents the results of applying the k-NN algorithm-based
    anomaly detection to the 1D hourly data of three key environmental parameters
    for mushroom cultivation. These successful implementation results of the k-NN
    model-based anomaly detection in the 1D environmental data, as illustrated in
    Figure 12, highlight the suitability and potential application of lightweight
    AI models for edge computing. Figure 12. Results of the AI-based anomaly-detection
    application to the 1D hourly (hr) environmental data for (a) temperature (T),
    (b) humidity (RH), and (c) CO2 level (CO2). As regards the 2D data, one problem
    is that although the temporal resampling method can deal with temporal gaps in
    the raw data, they still possibly occur in the resampled data (when the six original
    images within one hour are all black images). Hence, the anomaly-detection method
    should be applied to the hourly 2D data to detect these gaps. However, to deal
    with the high computational cost when processing numerous crop images, a preprocessing
    procedure series was applied to the 2D data to transform them into 1D data before
    conducting the AI-based anomaly detection. In particular, an RGB image was first
    converted to a grayscale image and subsequently transformed into a digital number
    value by averaging grayscale digital numbers from all pixels within an image scene
    (scene averaging). Figure 13 provides a general example of how to carry out AI-based
    anomaly detection in the 2D data and their results for mushroom images in this
    study. As can be seen from Figure 13, two types of outliers have been identified
    by using the k-NN anomaly-detection method. Anomalous data with digital numbers
    closer to 0 are assigned to the temporal gaps (black images), which do not provide
    any useful information, whereas the outliers with the highest values (e.g., greater
    than 80—a typical average grayscale digital number value) are identified and masked
    as “light image”, which still provide similar crop information to the normal images
    but at a higher brightness. Finally, after the resampled data are quality-controlled,
    they will be sent to the cloud server for storage and to the Short-term Analytics
    sub-module in the Backward Domain of the Edge Layer for supporting real-time decision
    making. Figure 13. An example of the AI-based anomaly-detection application to
    the 2D image data. The color maps on the left side display the heatmap of an original
    image in digital numbers for red, green, blue, and grayscale channels. 4.3. Implementation
    of Forward- and Backward-Domain–Cloud Layer In the Cloud Layer, high-quality BD
    transmitted from the Edge Layer after passing the data quality control procedure
    will be initially stored in the Big-Data Storage Module of the Forward Domain.
    These high-quality BD stored in the Cloud Layer were then sent to the AI Development
    Module for training high-computational-cost AI models based on specific user requirements.
    This study employed a widely used deep learning-based object-detection algorithm,
    the YOLOv5 model, to address the mushroom recognition problem, mainly for the
    2D image data. Moreover, to reduce the computational cost during the training
    process, the transfer learning technique was integrated to fine-tune the pre-trained
    YOLOv5 model for adapting the mushroom images stored in the Cloud Layer. Detailed
    information on training and evaluation of the YOLOv5 model for mushroom detection
    in this study is shown in Table 5. The obtained optimal hyperparameters were subsequently
    stored in the Parameter Storage module and were used for real-time deployment
    of this solution in the Edge Layer. Table 5. Information on the training and evaluation
    of the YOLOv5 model for mushroom detection. 4.4. Implementation of Backward Domain–Edge
    Layer The Backward Domain in the Edge Layer, which was carried out by the Real-time
    AI Development module, aims to provide integrated analytics for decision-making
    by combining the results of short-term and long-term analytics. In particular,
    on the one hand, the Short-term Analytics module in this layer obtained the key
    environmental-parameter anomaly-detection results from the Forward Domain in the
    Edge Layer, which was described in the section above (Implementation of Forward
    Domain–Edge Layer) and is shown in Figure 12. On the other hand, when it comes
    to long-term analytics, this module adapted the developed YOLOv5-based mushroom-recognition
    model for detection, based on the stored optimal model hyperparameters from the
    Backward Domain in the Cloud Layer. Representative examples of the YOLOv5 model
    deployment for mushroom detection in this study are depicted in Figure 14, whereas
    single-object (mushroom) areas are detected in continuous images with the red
    bounding box and confidence level by further applying instance segmentation. According
    to the figure, in general, most of the mushroom areas during the fruiting period
    can be well identified by the system, with a clear discrimination of the non-mushroom
    areas observed. This indicated the successful deployment of a high-computational-cost
    AI model in the Edge Layer, demonstrating its suitability to adopt a developed
    AI model in the Cloud Layer for edge computing. However, there are still several
    mushroom areas in an image that the system cannot detect, suggesting the need
    for retraining the model to improve its performance by the updated high-quality
    BD sent to the Cloud. The results from the long-term analytics can be integrated
    with those from the short-term analytics to support the system’s decision-making.
    For example, if outliers are detected in the streaming environmental data (results
    from the short-term analytics) during the mushroom’s fruiting period (results
    from the long-term analytics), the system can automatically send an alert notification
    to the users or control the sensors/actuators for maintaining the normal status
    of environmental conditions. Figure 14. An example of implementation of the Real-time
    AI Deployment module (deployment of YOLOv5 and transfer learning in mushroom detection).
    5. Discussion and Future Direction The major difference between this proposed
    research and related work mentioned in Table 1 and Table 2 is the combined use
    of the edge-computing paradigm in a smart greenhouse mushroom-cultivation information
    system. In particular, the Edge Layer was not included in the SAIS architecture
    for mushroom cultivation in Table 1 [28], while none of the previous mushroom
    management studies in Table 2 employed the edge computing model in their system.
    Thus, the successful practical application of this study can shed new light on
    leveraging edge-computing paradigm shifts as well as improving smart mushroom
    cultivation systems. In addition, a minor discrepancy that is worth mentioning
    is the introduction of a new low-cost combination IoT environmental sensor made
    by a Korean company. This product combines three single sensors for different
    environmental parameters into one sensor (three-in-one sensor) and also employs
    low-cost Raspberry Pi single-board computers working in the resource-saving edge
    computing paradigm, so it can contribute to the diverse selections for clients
    in low-cost smart agriculture devices and information system markets. Notwithstanding
    the benefits of edge computing in complementing classical cloud computing and
    in improving smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation, this preliminary study may
    suffer from several challenges in the future. First, the implementation costs
    when scaling this framework up to a larger scale for other crops, together with
    integrating outdoor smart agriculture systems, are questionable, since additional
    costs from new IoT devices and their installation might be included in the system.
    This may limit the commercialization of this framework for business objectives.
    Second, the improvement in mushroom production efficiency when the edge computing
    paradigm is included is not fully analyzed, suggesting the implementation of more
    detailed analyses for this problem in further studies. Addressing potential challenges
    is also related to the future outlook of this research. Besides the application
    customized for mushroom cultivation, the successful practical implementation of
    this study suggests a potential to scale up this framework for business objectives
    and other user-specific requirements (e.g., other crops) in future studies. To
    this end, in the future direction, this fundamental SAIS architecture is expected
    to be coupled with the two new layers, including the User and Administration Layers.
    The potential architecture for future the SAIS is illustrated in Figure 15, and
    a detailed description for each added layer is provided below. Figure 15. The
    potential architecture of the future SAIS for business objectives. The blue dashed
    border and arrows indicate the Forward Domain and its procedure, and the red dashed
    border and arrows indicate the Backward Domain and its procedure. User Layer:
    This layer is particularly designed for the users of the SAIS such as farmers
    or clients. From the user’s perspective, the acquisition of quality-controlled
    datasets and the intuitive visualization of these datasets with timely notifications
    if any anomalous events occur from the Cloud Layer, and the capability to control
    the devices manually in an emergency in the Device Layer, are preferable. Thus,
    several respective modules such as Data Extraction, Visualization/Notification,
    or Manual Device Controlling Modules can be considered in this layer. Since the
    users mainly work in the Device and Cloud Layers, the users can only access these
    two layers, and they do not need to access the Edge Layer to adjust any edge computing
    tasks. Administration Layer: This layer is particularly designed for the providers
    or developers (e.g., companies) of the SAIS for business goals. Unlike the users,
    the administrators aim to manage all the data flow from the Device Layer to the
    Cloud Layer, so they can access and collect data from all the layers in this system,
    which can be conducted by the Data Extraction/Management module. Moreover, the
    administrators can meet the specific user requirements by developing suitable
    solutions, and ensure the safety of the system by maintaining the security. Therefore,
    the two respective modules including Application Development and Network Security
    are considered in this layer. Not only are the above additional layers being included,
    but the Device Layer is also planning to be extended with new sensors, in the
    future system. Microcontrollers and several controlling sensors/actuators (e.g.,
    heaters, fans, humidifiers, or air ventilation…) are expected to be utilized,
    which can complement the current indoor system. Furthermore, a parallel SAIS for
    outdoor smart agriculture with relevant IoT devices (e.g., smart rain gauges,
    automated weather sensors, irrigation valves, or unmanned aerial vehicles…) can
    be considered and developed for an integrated indoor–outdoor smart agriculture
    system. 6. Conclusions Traditional Device-Cloud protocol in smart agriculture
    often suffers from the challenges of delayed system responses caused by low bandwidth
    and high latency, together with high cloud-service costs for data computation
    and storage when enormous numbers of data acquired from IoT devices are directly
    transmitted to the cloud server without processing. Novel edge computing offers
    an effective solution to deal with challenges in this traditional protocol by
    shifting partial data storage and computation capability from the cloud server
    to edge devices. Nevertheless, selecting which tasks can be implemented in edge
    computing depends on user-specific demands, suggesting the need to design a specific
    and proper Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS) architecture that is compatible
    with single-crop requirements. Based on the nutritious and commercial benefits
    of edible mushrooms as well as the necessity of cost reduction from a business
    viewpoint, the major goal of this study is to design and implement a standard
    multilayered SAIS architecture for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation toward
    leveraging edge computing, which can be scalable for business goals. In this designed
    SAIS, the three-layer architecture, which couples edge computing in the central
    layer to connect the Device and Cloud Layers (Device-Edge-Cloud protocol) and
    enables automation in mushroom management using an integration of the IoT environmental
    sensor (for mushroom key environmental-parameter monitoring) and surveillance
    camera (for intuitive mushroom monitoring) was employed and tested in a testbed
    site in the Republic of Korea. Via this designed SAIS, we aim to introduce the
    advanced combination environmental IoT sensors developed by Korean companies,
    a standard network flow that is possible for scalability and suitable edge computing
    tasks, with typical examples. Moreover, a potential SAIS architecture with additional
    layers for a future direction for business purposes was also suggested. The successfully
    implemented SAIS architecture indicated that our combination IoT environmental
    sensor integrated with a surveillance camera could monitor the real-time key environmental
    parameters affecting mushroom growth and intuitive mushroom information. Typical
    examples of mushroom cultivation based on the collected data revealed that several
    low-cost data pre-processing procedures including small-data storage, temporal
    resampling-based data reduction, and lightweight artificial intelligence (AI)-based
    data quality control for anomaly detection within environmental conditions, together
    with real-time AI model (YOLOv5) deployment for mushroom recognition from crop
    images, are compatible with edge computing. In contrast, high-quality BD storage
    and high-computational-cost AI model development can be implemented in the cloud.
    Moreover, integrating the Edge Layer as the center of the traditional protocol
    can significantly save network resources and operational costs by reducing unnecessary
    data sent from the device to the cloud while keeping sufficient information. Finally,
    the future improvement suggests including additional layers to meet user-specific
    demands for business objectives and the extension of the current system with new
    controlling sensors and a parallel outdoor system, toward an integrated indoor–outdoor
    smart agriculture system. Author Contributions Conceptualization, H.H.N., D.-Y.S.

  description: Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is an important parameter
    in the plant photosynthesis process, which can relate to plant growth, crop water
    use, and leaf gas exchange. Previously, many researchers utilized commercially
    available sensors to monitor PAR. The high cost of the commercially available
    PAR sensors has limited researchers, agricultural professionals, and farmers to
    use and expand PAR monitoring in agricultural lands. Thus, this paper focuses
    on designing an affordable Internet of Things (IoT)-based PAR sensor monitoring
    system including 3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance
    evaluation of multiple light sensors, solar powering configuration, cloud setup,
    and cost analysis. Three sensors, including VTB8440BH photodiode, SI 1145, and
    LI-190R sensors, were evaluated. The 3D-printed waterproof enclosures were designed
    for the photodiode and SI 1145. Particle Boron was used for recording and sending
    the sensor data to the IoT webserver. Both the photodiode and SI 1145 were compared
    to LI-190R, which is the industry standard. In the calibration process, the R2
    values of the photodiode and SI 1145 with LI-190R were 0.609 and 0.961, respectively.
    Field validation data shows that SI 1145 had a strong correlation with LI-190R.
    In addition, the performance evaluation data shows the photodiode had a weaker
    correlation with LI-190R than SI 1145. In conclusion, the study successfully developed
    and designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring systems,
    including a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website. SI 1145
    with a glass filter is an alternative sensor to monitor PAR at a low cost and
    has the advantage of being connected to IoT microcontrollers.

    Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is an important parameter in the plant
    photosynthesis process, which can relate to plant growth, crop water use, and
    leaf gas exchange. Previously, many researchers utilized commercially available
    sensors to monitor PAR. The high cost of the commercially available PAR sensors
    has limited researchers, agricultural professionals, and farmers to use and expand
    PAR monitoring in agricultural lands. Thus, this paper focuses on designing an
    affordable Internet of Things (IoT)-based PAR sensor monitoring system including
    3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance evaluation of
    multiple light sensors, solar powering configuration, cloud setup, and cost analysis.
    Three sensors, including VTB8440BH photodiode, SI 1145, and LI-190R sensors, were
    evaluated. The 3D-printed waterproof enclosures were designed for the photodiode
    and SI 1145. Particle Boron was used for recording and sending the sensor data
    to the IoT webserver. Both the photodiode and SI 1145 were compared to LI-190R,
    which is the industry standard. In the calibration process, the R2 values of the
    photodiode and SI 1145 with LI-190R were 0.609 and 0.961, respectively. Field
    validation data shows that SI 1145 had a strong correlation with LI-190R. In addition,
    the performance evaluation data shows the photodiode had a weaker correlation
    with LI-190R than SI 1145. In conclusion, the study successfully developed and
    designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring systems, including
    a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website. SI 1145 with a glass
    filter is an alternative sensor to monitor PAR at a low cost and has the advantage
    of being connected to IoT microcontrollers. Keywords: Photosynthetically Active
    Radiation (PAR); IoT (Internet of Things); agriculture 1. Introduction Photosynthetically
    Active Radiation (PAR) describes the range of solar radiation that is used by
    organisms in the photosynthesis process. The wavelength of solar radiation in
    the PAR range is 400–700 nm. PAR measurement is important, as solar radiation
    is one of the main components determining plant photosynthesis. When leaf photosynthesis
    increases, PAR increases [1]. Standard commercially available PAR sensors include
    LI-190R (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) and Apogee SQ-500 (Apogee Instruments,
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA). In the past, PAR sensors have been used in various research,
    such as measuring the amount of light above and below the canopy of wheat [2];
    monitoring light in vertical farming for strawberry production [3]; measuring
    and controlling a lighting system for energy efficient crop production [4]; parameterizing
    evapotranspiration rates across a field of asparagus [5]; assessing the effects
    of full sun, medium light intensity, and vegetation shade on diverse species of
    plants [6]; and understanding the effect of PAR on the exchange of CO2, water,
    and energy between plants and their environment [7]. An example of using a PAR
    sensor is estimating the growth of soybeans. Soybeans, a known photosensitive
    crop, have been used to test PAR levels in accordance with simulated surface dimming,
    a way to decrease photosynthetically active radiation. A study within the Journal
    of Agrometeorology took three genomes of soybeans and tested their response to
    altered PAR levels via a custom shading net [8]. The study was done to find the
    best way to decrease PAR levels, which they tested using a Line quantum sensor
    (LI-191S, LICOR). Even though it has been stated that climate change will not
    have a major impact on PAR levels [9], it can be predicted that levels will change.
    These changes, however, are more impacted by local environmental factors, with
    its main parameter being water vapor pressure. Excessive gas emissions can also
    cause PAR levels to lower due to an increase in particulate matter in the atmosphere
    [9], thus absorbing more PAR prior to reaching the Earth’s surface. The cost of
    the standard PAR sensor is between 400–500 USD, and the datalogging system cost
    ranges from 500–2300 USD. This high cost of the commercial version of the PAR
    monitoring systems, including a PAR sensor and a datalogger, limits access for
    researchers, farmers, and agricultural professionals. This motivates the development
    of a low-cost version of a PAR monitoring system. The presentation of a low-cost,
    low-profile Photosynthetic Active Radiation sensor that was developed by Purdue
    University was first introduced at the ISCAS conference in Spain [10]. This sensor’s
    composition includes a silicon photodiode, a 400 to 700 nm optical filter, an
    optical diffuser, and a current-to-voltage conversion circuit. The translucent
    material of the diffuser disperses incoming light, which results in angle dependence.
    To amend this occurrence, the light diffuser uses a cosine corrector. There are
    various commercially available PAR quantum sensors, such as the LI-190R. While
    these sensors are very precise and well-calibrated, they are quite costly. Seated
    in the USD 300–400 price range, this does not include the corresponding meter
    required to display the output. Meanwhile, this newly developed low-cost PAR sensor
    has a total cost of half the amount: 111.83 USD.Light intensity is the factor
    contributing to the level of error displayed by this sensor. For the highest accuracy,
    light intensity must be at maximum intensity. Similar to the sensor developed
    by Purdue University, the GaAsP sensor has a sensor head and body that includes
    a photodiode and an acrylic diffuser that protects the photodiode. This provides
    cosine correction, like the sensor developed by Purdue University. Also, this
    sensor comprises an aluminum tube, a drainage hole, and an acrylic body located
    below the diffuser bonded via methylene chloride. For quick connection and disconnection
    for calibration and repair in a field setting, the sensor was designed with 40–50
    cm of multi-stranded communication wire. The GaAsP does have some sources of error,
    including spatial error, temperature dependence error, spectral response error,
    and signal drift error. Spatial error is the main source of errors, but it can
    be minimized if both the diffuser and photodiode are level with the outer rim
    of the sensor. Temperature dependence error occurs when temperatures reach levels
    above 15 °C, at a 3% margin. Previously, researchers developed an inexpensive
    datalogging system and connected it to a commercial version of a PAR sensor. For
    example, Barnard et al. (2014) utilized an Arduino microcontroller (Arduino, Turin,
    Italy) as a datalogger to read an LI-190 [11]. Harun et al. (2015) used an ATMEGA628
    microcontroller (Microchip, Chandler, AZ, USA) to read an LI-190 [12]. An inexpensive
    data logging system with a commercial version of a PAR sensor still costs around
    700 USD [11]. Other studies have developed a low-cost PAR sensor using a photodiode.
    For instance, the Vishay BPW34 photodiode (Vishay, Malvern, PA, USA) was used
    to measure PAR [13]. This design used a silicon photodiode, a diffuser, and an
    optical filter. This study found that the sensor measured PAR well at high light
    intensities, but had a larger error at lower light intensities. Pontailler (1990)
    also used a gallium arsenide photodiode to measure PAR [14]. This design did not
    use a filter, only the photodiode and a diffuser. The results show a good correlation
    with the LI-190 PAR sensor, but it overestimated by about 23% when measuring monochromatic
    light, which is in the wavelength range of 570–620 nm, one example of light that
    produces this wavelength range is sodium lamps. The University of England carried
    out a case study centered around triticale, where the methodology for measuring
    the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) using both
    active optical and linear irradiance sensors was described [15]. This measure
    of PAR is an important aspect of plant biomass production and plant growth modeling.
    The linear irradiance sensor newly created by Spectrum Technologies was studied
    and applied to agriculture through the crop triticale. The conclusion of this
    study emphasized the importance of sensor placement and solar illumination conditions.
    The linear quantum bar sensor was used to measure soil and canopy PAR (Rs and
    Rcs) but needed to be positioned at least 40 cm above the intended surface. It
    was explained that the linear quantum bar could achieve temporally stable readings
    within an elevation of 5° of solar noon. Also recommended was orienting the linear
    quantum sensor across rows to reduce measurement variance. There have also been
    methods to measure PAR using leaf area index measuring tools. Located in West
    Africa, a study focusing on millet crop and shrub fallow used this method for
    estimating the Intercepted PAR (IPAR). The Li-Coy LAI-2000 hemispherical radiation
    sensor is a sensor originally intended to estimate the canopy leaf area index.
    The LAI provides both canopy structure and angular information, allowing for a
    more efficient manner to measure these values compared to traditional methods.
    These methods allowed for a successful simulation of both instantaneous and daily
    IPAR. Results showed that a reasonable degree of accuracy can be achieved by using
    the LAI-2000. A noteworthy mention explains that both clear and cloudy days lead
    to increased errors [16]. Previous research shows an improvement in the design
    and development of a PAR sensor monitoring system is needed. As technology has
    developed, the IoT (Internet of Things) allows for connecting, monitoring, and
    controlling devices in real-time at a low cost [17]. Examples of many different
    applications for IoT have been implemented by growers in various countries for
    increased efficiency. Increased cost efficiency, energy efficiency, and work efficiency
    are all areas of benefit when utilizing the IoT in agriculture. Data transmission
    efficiency was studied in a review by Xu et al. (2022) on different methods for
    data transmission for the IoT in agriculture [18]. Various tradeoffs exist in
    terms of IoT data-sharing systems. These include Wi-Fi, LoRa, Bluetooth, and WAN
    wireless; these systems are readily available for implementation depending on
    the needs of the producer [18]. This exemplifies the customization that IoT has
    to offer the industry as well as academia to outfit a system to the exact specifications
    needed. An increase in customization and optimization undoubtedly increases the
    user experience as well as ensures that each system is only using what is needed
    for a given project. An example of this was the ZigBee WSN (wireless sensor network)
    optimized for medium-range usage within a large greenhouse space for humidity
    and fan monitoring using nodes [19]. This system utilized in the study demonstrates
    the basics of how an IoT network can store data and, furthermore, allows for it
    to be transported to the correct location. In addition to ZigBee, LoRa and Wi-Fi
    are also utilized to transfer the data and signals to drive actuators at a low
    cost [20]. Emerging communication technologies, including 5G and NB-IoT (narrow-band
    IoT), have started to be implemented in precision agriculture [21]. By 2026, the
    IoT market is expected to achieve an evaluation of USD 13 billion [22]. While
    the costs of the IoT for usage in precision farming may increase growers’ operating
    costs, the savings generated from time usage efficiency negate upfront costs.
    For example, in 2022, a system to monitor indoor environment data using IoT and
    open-source software was able to see a cost reduction from 230,000 USD to 5000
    USD for a 9290 m2 building using a traditional BAS (Building Assessment System),
    establishing a cost-effective, scalable, and portable IoT data infrastructure
    for indoor environment sensing named BDL (Building Data Lite) [23]. By creating
    a cost-effective system for IoT data measurement, the design team was able to
    save thousands of dollars on a monitoring system. The usage of open-source software
    should be noted also as this is becoming an increasingly popular method to drive
    down costs and increase system sharing [24]. IoT creations and optimizations are
    changing the operating landscape in which humans monitor the world. By creating
    systems that are more cost-effective, saleable, and connect more seamlessly, a
    natural trend of increasing profits will follow, barring no other unforeseen circumstances.
    As the cost of the IoT system decreases, the IoT technology has been utilized
    in many applications in agriculture, including plant disease prediction, frost
    protection, and irrigation scheduling [25,26]. This led to an increase in crop
    yields and quality [12,27,28]. The use of IoT technology in agriculture is expected
    to increase further as other previous studies have demonstrated its benefits in
    helping stakeholders make timely and informed decisions [29]. Over the years,
    many open-source photodiodes and light sensors have been developed. However, the
    evaluation and their potential use for PAR monitoring with a glass-cut filter
    have not been demonstrated. Moreover, making the PAR data more accessible through
    the IoT has not been well executed. Thus, the purpose of this paper focuses on
    the design and development of an affordable IoT-based PAR monitoring system, including
    3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance evaluation of
    each sensor, solar powering configuration, cloud setup, and cost. This affordable
    IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring system will make the PAR measurements more accessible
    to researchers, farmers, agricultural industries, and environmental scientists.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. PAR Sensors Three sensors were evaluated: an Excelitas
    Technologies VTB8440BH photodiode (Waltham, MA, USA); an Adafruit SI 1145 Digital
    UV Index, IR, and Visible Light Sensor (New York, NY, USA); and LI-190R PAR sensor
    (Lincoln, NE, USA). The LI-190R outputs millivolts but can be converted to μmol
    m−2 s−1 using Equation (1), which was referred to by LI-Cor Biosciences technical
    document. LI-190R has a spectral range of 400–700 nm. The VTB8440BH photodiode
    has a spectral range of 330–720 nm and a viewing angle of 100°. The SI 1145 has
    an IR and a visible light sensor; the IR sensor has a spectral range of 550–1000
    nm, and the visible light sensor has a spectral range of 400–800 nm. In this study,
    the visible light sensor of SI 1145 was used because it has a spectral range closer
    to that of PAR (400–700 nm). 𝑃𝐴𝑅= 𝑉 𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∗240.33 (1) where PAR is the PAR reading
    in μmol m−2 s−1, and Vout is the output from the LI-190R in mV. 2.2. Hardware
    Design For the photodiode and the LI-190R circuit, an Adafruit ADS 1115 analog-to-digital
    converter (New York, NY, USA) was used to read the sensor values in 16 bits, which
    allows for higher resolution measurement. A differential reading was used for
    each measurement, which takes a reading using two pins from each sensor. The circuit
    was controlled by a Particle Boron (San Francisco, CA, USA) microcontroller [30],
    and it has an embedded 4G LTE cell modem to send the data to the IoT cloud web
    server. I2C communication in Boron was utilized to connect it with ADS 1115 and
    SI 1145. Particle Boron 4G LTE was selected in this study due to the availability
    of the device, but any other microcontrollers with 4G or 5G technology can also
    be utilized for data logging. Both the photodiode and the SI 1145 are sensitive
    to light outside of the PAR spectral range. Thus, an optical UV AR IR glass-cut
    filter (Gzikai, Guangzhou, China) was used to filter out light outside of PAR
    spectral range. The optical glass-cut filter allows light between 415 nm and 655
    nm to pass through (Figure 1). The filter has a diameter of 6.5 mm and is 1 mm
    thick. The filters used in this design were 5 USD. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
    sheet (CGjiogujio, Nanjing, China) was used to diffuse the light entering the
    glass filter and sensor. The sheet is 2 mm thick, and a 7 mm circular section
    was cut using a cork borer. The PTFE sheet sits directly on top of the glass filter,
    and there is a 2 mm gap between the glass filter and the light sensor for both
    the photodiode and the SI 1145. A layout of the sensor, a glass filter, and a
    PTFE sheet is shown in Figure 2. Figure 1. Light penetration of the UV AR IR glass-cut
    filter. Figure 2. Diagram of the layout of the PTFE sheet and glass filter for
    the photodiode and SI1145. An enclosure was designed and 3D-printed for the photodiode
    and the SI 1145. The design was made using Thinkercad (Autodesk Inc., San Francisco,
    CA, USA) software and printed with the MakerBot Replicator 2 3D printer (New York,
    NY, USA). The enclosure consists of two pieces: one piece allows for the glass
    filter and PTFE sheet to be set in place and has a cut-out for either the photodiode
    or the SI 1145. The other piece is a plate that attaches four bolts and nuts.
    The pieces were printed using polylactic acid (PLA). The groove of the enclosure
    allows the use of a cable tie to mount the enclosure to a pipe or a post. The
    enclosure was made waterproof by using a clear silicone caulk at each of the openings.
    The drawing for the enclosure is shown in Figure 3 and printed enclosure is shown
    in Figure 4. Figure 3. Enclosure design. (A): Outside of the enclosure. (B): Bottom
    plate of the enclosure. (C): Inside of the enclosure for the photodiode. (D):
    Inside of the enclosure for SI 1145. (E): Cross-section of enclosure for the photodiode.
    (F): Cross-section of enclosure for the SI 1145. Figure 4. 3D-printed housing
    for SI 1145 and photodiode. To use the PAR sensor monitoring system (Particle
    Boron and PAR sensor) in outdoor conditions, a lead–acid 12 V 7 Ah battery, a
    solar charge controller, and a 12 V 20 W solar panel were used to power the devices.
    An IP67 waterproof enclosure (290 × 190 × 140 mm) was used to house Boron, solar
    charge controller, and a lead–acid 12 V 7 Ah battery. Overall diagram of the affordable
    PAR sensor monitoring system is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. System diagram of
    the IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring system. 2.3. IoT and Program Design The three
    sensors were connected to Particle Boron to measure, record, and send the values
    to Ubidots IoT webserver [31]. Sensor data is stored on Ubidots as raw variables.
    Synthetic variable function on Ubidots allows users to enter equations to solve
    mathematical problems on the cloud. The instructions of functions are provided
    on Ubidots manual. This synthetic variable function was used to enter each developed
    calibration equation for photodiode and SI 1145 in Ubidots to calculate the estimated
    radiation values. Ubidots allow storing the data for up to 2 years. The dashboard
    on the website allows user to display the data in an easy-to-understand and effective
    way (Figure 6). The data is updated every 10 min and allows real-time data monitoring.
    The 10 min time interval was chosen to minimize battery loss. When the sensors
    were not reading, the 4G modem module was deactivated. The flow of the microcontroller
    programming is shown in Figure 7. In the program, the Boron only connects with
    the cell tower when it sends the value to Ubidots. This allows for saving data
    usage and battery. For each sensor, 100 samples were taken with a 100-millisecond
    delay from each measurement, and then the average was recorded. Figure 6. Screenshot
    of the IoT web server that displays data and shares with users. Figure 7. Flow
    of the microcontroller program. 2.4. Sensor Calibration The sensors were compared
    using a full-spectrum light-intensity controllable 1000 W LED grow light (Viparspectra,
    Richmond, CA, USA). This experiment was conducted in a controlled environment.
    The three sensors were all placed 12.5 cm from the light and were taking readings
    simultaneously. The intensity of the light was increased at different intervals
    ranging from off to maximum intensity. The reading from each of the sensors was
    recorded at each of these intervals and compared. 2.5. Sensor Evaluation in Outdoor
    Environments Three sensors, LI-190R, photodiode, and SI 1145, were installed outside
    at Michigan State University Campus, East Lansing, MI, USA. The sensors were at
    a height of 203 cm and mounted on a 5.08 cm diameter PVC pipe with a cable tie.
    There were no obstructions affecting the path from sunlight to each sensor. A
    12 V 20 W solar panel and a solar charge controller were used to charge a lead–acid
    12 V 7 Ah battery. Particle boron was powered through the micro-USB port. Each
    sensor data was collected every 10 min and sent to the Ubidots webserver. 2.6.
    Statistical Analysis To evaluate the performance of the proposed affordable PAR
    sensor designs, the measurements were compared against the LI-190R PAR sensor.
    Statistical analysis was performed using root mean squared error (RMSE), index
    of agreement (IA), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2),
    and used Microsoft Excel for calculation. RMSE measures the difference between
    the measured and predicted value and is defined in Equation (2), IA is defined
    in Equation (3), and MBE is defined in Equation (4). RMSE= 1 N ∑ N i=1 ( M i −
    P i ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (2) IA=1− ∑ N i=1 ( M i − P i ) 2 ∑

    3.1. Sensor Calibration Figure 8 shows the comparison of the photodiode’s output
    and LI-190R. The relationship was exponential and the R2 was 0.609. Figure 9 shows
    the comparison of the SI 1145′s output and LI-190R. The relationship was fitted
    with 2nd order polynomial, and the R2 was 0.961. This result shows a strong correlation
    between LI-190R and SI 1145. This correlation for the SI 1145 is comparable to
    that of Rocha et al. (2021), who obtained R2 values of 0.962 and 0.958 when compared
    to solar radiation for two prototypes of the PAR sensor using a photodiode [13].
    Fielder et al. (2000) achieved an R2 value of 0.999 when comparing their photodiode
    to a LI-190 quantum sensor [32]. Figure 8. Comparison of photodiode with LI-190R
    from the calibration process. Figure 9. Comparison of SI 1145 with LI-190R from
    the calibration process. 3.2. Sensor Evaluation in Outdoor Environments Figure
    10 shows the comparison of LI-190R, SI 1145, and photodiode data in the outdoor
    environment. Table 1 shows the results of the statistical analysis for comparing
    the SI 1145 and the photodiode measurements to the LI-190R values. The statistical
    analysis indicates that SI 1145 was overestimated by 3.564 μmol  m −2  s −1 based
    on MBE. These errors are relatively small compared to the range measured throughout
    the day, which can be from zero to up to 1700 μmol  m −2  s −1 . The photodiode
    had an underestimate for MBE of −31.399 μmol  m −2  s −1 . The SI 1145 had a much
    higher IA value (0.989) than the photodiode (0.834). The IA of the SI1145 is comparable
    to that of a study conducted by Rocha et al. (2021), which obtained an IA of 0.953
    and 0.950 for the two prototypes of PAR sensors using photodiodes [13]. Figure

    Table 1. Statistical analysis results. 3.3. Cost The goal of this design is to
    be less expensive than a PAR sensor monitoring system currently available on the
    market. The components used in the design are low-cost and easily obtainable,
    making the overall design easy to replicate. Table 2 lists each component necessary
    to replicate the system for the SI 1145, photodiode, and LI-190R, respectively.
    The cost to build a PAR sensor monitoring system with SI 1145 and the photodiode
    is 202 and 207 USD, respectively. This is less expensive than using a microcontroller
    to read a commercial PAR sensor like the LI-190R. For example, the design outlined
    by Barnard et al. (2014), using an Arduino microcontroller with an LI-190 sensor,
    costs 685 USD [11]. Table 2. Material Cost for Power, LI-190R, SI 1145, and Photodiode
    System. The cost is comparable to other studies using a microcontroller and a
    photodiode to measure PAR. The cost of a system utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller
    is estimated at 200 USD [13]. The advantage of the design outlined in this paper
    is the ability to deploy the sensor anywhere as it uses a 4G LTE cell tower instead
    of Wi-Fi that ESP8266 uses. A cellular module can be added to the ESP8266 to utilize
    3G or 4G technologies, but the total costs, usability, and complexity of the additional
    module are not justified compared to the proposed system. 4. Conclusions The study
    successfully compared both the photodiode (VTB8440BH) and SI 1145 with LI-190R.
    The performance of SI 1145 had a strong correlation (R2 = 0.961) with LI-190R.
    However, the photodiode had a weaker correlation with LI-190R (R2 = 0.609). This
    study successfully designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring
    systems, including a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website.
    The cost of building the SI 1145 was about 20% of the cost of building a monitoring
    system using the LI-190R sensor. Considering a similar performance between SI
    1145 and LI-190R (IA = 0.989, MBE = 3.564), an SI 1145 with an optical UV AR IR
    glass-cut filter would be the alternative way to monitor PAR. Because of this
    affordable PAR sensor, researchers, farmers, agricultural industries, foresters,
    and environmental scientists may use more PAR sensors for plant/tree growth prediction,
    water uptake estimation, irrigation management, etc. Recent studies show that
    PAR measurement has been utilized in indoor farming [33] and irrigation scheduling
    [34]. Soybeans are known as photosensitive crops; the accurate prediction of the
    growth stages of a soybean will enable precision irrigation scheduling, which
    will improve crop production and irrigation water use efficiency. Incorporation
    of PAR data with other field monitoring data, such as soil moisture monitoring
    [27] and SAP flow [35], for irrigation scheduling is recommended for future study.
    More applications of the developed affordable IoT-based PAR sensor in other agricultural
    systems, such as animal production, aquaculture, and high tunnel, should also
    be explored. Further studies assessing different photodiodes to monitor their
    capability to measure PAR should be performed and compared to this proposed design.

    1. Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are systems in which multiple
    sensors communicate with each other to transmit the data they have collected from
    a field to a gateway. WSNs can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending
    on the employed sensor types. A homogeneous sensor network consists of sensors
    of the same type, while a heterogeneous sensor network comprises sensors of different
    types. Heterogeneous sensor networks allow the collection of information related
    to diverse variables from the environment. WSNs, a significant application of
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology, play a crucial role in facilitating communication
    among objects, enabling data transfer between them. The aim of these applications
    is to improve energy efficiency and expedite decision-making processes. As IoT
    technology advances, WSNs find utility in various sectors for a multitude of purposes.
    WSNs are used for various applications, including detecting forest fires, observing
    wildlife, numerous applications in the health sector, smart farming practices,
    determining traffic density in smart cities, ensuring border security for military
    purposes, controlling war zones, and monitoring smart home security systems and
    devices in smart homes [1]. Sensors have the capability to sense data within their
    sensing range and transmit the sensed data to other sensors within their communication
    range [2]. Sensors are devices with limited battery power, low processing capabilities,
    and limited memory. Therefore, extending the network lifetime in WSNs composed
    of these sensor nodes is a crucial challenge. To sustain the WSN structure for
    an extended period, some improvements need to be implemented. The key factors
    include strategically placing sensors in the right locations and determining the
    shortest path for the sensor data collected from the field to reach the gateway.
    The solution to these sub-problems extends the network lifetime. Efficient sensor
    placement in a field presents several considerations. Foreknowledge of the specific
    points to be monitored within the target region is essential. The strategic placement
    of the sensors must account for the frequency with which scanning areas will be
    covered by different sensors. Following this distributed placement procedure,
    the possibility of placing multiple sensors in the same location is explored.
    In this study, we strategically position the sensors within the sensor nodes distributed
    across the target region. This packaging strategy is designed to optimize the
    battery energy consumption by promoting the sharing of a common battery and bandwidth
    among sensors. Additionally, it contributes to cost reduction in the installation.
    In this research, we proposed Offline Network Deployment mathematical model to
    deploy the sensor nodes across a target region. This offline model is used only
    once before the field monitoring task in order to optimally place the sensors
    within the target region. During the transmission of the collected data from the
    field to the gateway, the data can be lost due to the length of the paths. In
    the research [3], to prevent the data loss, it is suggested to keep copies of
    the measured data on neighboring sensor nodes. However, maintaining multiple copies
    of the same data in the model leads to unnecessary memory usage and, consequently,
    more battery energy consumption. This study deliberately excludes the scenario
    of data duplication on the sensors, focusing instead on minimizing the number
    of hops a data packet undertakes to reach the gateway in striving towards effective
    energy utilization. The sensors consume a certain amount of energy when sensing
    data, transmitting data, and being in the sleep mode [4]. The amount of energy
    consumed by the sensors is a critical factor directly influencing the network’s
    lifetime [5]. In this study, bringing sensors together in a box and using a shared
    battery helps to minimize the amount of energy consumed. In the offline model,
    accurately placing sensor nodes in the target region also reduces the number of
    hops, thus decreasing the energy required for the data transmission. The research
    study [3] proposes an offline model that calculates the route through which the
    data will be transmitted to the gateway once. This situation can render the model
    ineffective in the event of a sensor node failure within the network. This study
    employs an online mathematical model to ascertain the data flow routes. The node-to-gateway
    data routes are dynamically adjusted based on the current network state at each
    time period. Consequently, if a sensor node becomes inactive due to the factors
    such as a depleted battery or any other reason, the data flow route is automatically
    recalculated to adapt to the altered network configuration. Wireless sensor networks
    can be controlled in centralized or decentralized manners. In the centralized
    control of a network, the control commands are calculated by a central decision
    maker, and each network element acts according to the decision made by the center.
    In the decentralized control of a network, each network element has the potential
    to make decisions independently of the others [6]. As an example, a sensor node
    can decide through which sensors it should transmit data to the gateway. In this
    work, we focus on a centralized WSN control model including offline and online
    stages. The mathematical models for both stages are executed as a centralized
    control, and the sensor nodes operate in the network according to the decisions
    made by the central decision maker. In this study, a heterogeneous network model
    is employed, and the sensor nodes are created by grouping sensors. Each sensor
    node is placed inside a protective box, allowing the node’s battery and bandwidth
    to be commonly utilized by the sensors within. Decisions are made to minimize
    the number of boxes when grouping sensors. Using an offline model, the sensor
    nodes are placed in the field based on the coverage requirements of the target
    points. In order to secure the network connectivity, there should be at least
    a minimum number of active nodes within the communication range of a sensor node.
    Connectivity and coverage problems are addressed through this approach. Taking
    into account the energy expenditures in sensing, transmitting, active, and sleep
    modes of the sensors, the sensor node activity schedules are determined under
    the battery energy constraints. Moreover, our online energy optimization model
    determines the minimum energy consuming node-to-gateway data flow paths within
    the bandwidth limits of the sensor nodes. This study has been simulated on the
    application of the proposed two-stage mathematical models on an agricultural farmland.
    The ultimate aim is to deploy the soil temperature and humidity sensors in the
    farmland in a connected manner, and maximize the network lifetime for smooth information
    flow from the field. The study is supported by the hardware tests. The parameters
    are obtained through the hardware implementation, which are then served as the
    input parameters to our mathematical models. The primary contributions of this
    research to the literature can be summarized as follows: Deployment of Sensor
    Nodes Based on Land Coverage Requirements:The study focuses on placing sensor
    nodes by considering the coverage requirements in agricultural farmland, contributing
    to the optimization of the field coverage. Utilization of a Heterogeneous Network
    Model: By adopting a heterogeneous network model, the study groups sensors to
    create sensor nodes, allowing sensors within a node to leverage the node’s battery
    and bandwidth. Integration of Offline and Online Mathematical Models: The study
    employs an offline model to place sensor nodes based on the coverage requirements
    and an online mathematical model to facilitate data flow from sensor nodes to
    the gateway in real-time. Comprehensive Examination of Energy Expenditures: Energy
    consumption, including sensing, transmission, active, and sleep modes, as well
    as the total battery energy of sensor nodes, is thoroughly examined to effectively
    manage the energy usage. Resolution of Connectivity and Coverage Issues: The study
    addresses connectivity and coverage problems by considering the coverage requirements
    and the minimum number of nodes required around each sensor node during the deployment.
    Reduction of Hop Count and Enhancement of Data Transmission Efficiency: The proposed
    model improves energy efficiency by reducing the hop count and ensures efficient
    data transmission to the gateway, thus minimizing the data loss. 2. Literature
    Review Numerous studies in the literature have delved into sub-problems related
    to the focus of this research. A prominent concern in these studies revolves around
    the impact of sensor placement on energy consumption during data transmission.
    For instance, this challenge is formulated as a non-concave Boolean optimization
    problem and proposed a solution method that relaxes both the ’s’ and Boolean constraints
    to optimize the sensor deployment [7]. Energy efficiency is a key concern in WSNs,
    and several studies have proposed different approaches to address this challenge.
    One approach is to strategically position sensors to cover the target area while
    minimizing the sensor usage [8]. Another approach is to facilitate data exchange
    among sensors to reduce the volume of data passing through individual sensors
    [9]. Additionally, WSNs often consist of sensors with diverse technical specifications
    that jointly perceive a given area while collecting the same data type. This study
    focuses on the collective placement and grouping of sensors alongside other network
    elements to maximize the data collection across the entire area over extended
    periods [10]. In the research [11], a novel approach is proposed to data loss
    prevention in WSNs. Their approach is based on the idea of grouping sensors in
    different locations for data transmission, while emphasizing the arrangement of
    network elements located within the same vicinity. The central theme of this research
    lies in optimizing data routing to minimize energy consumption, wherein network
    elements play a crucial role in data transmission. The selection of optimal groupings
    is determined through an online model. This approach has several advantages over
    other data loss prevention techniques. First, it is energy-efficient, as it groups
    sensors together in a way that minimizes energy consumption. Second, it is reliable,
    as it takes into account the reliability of each sensor when grouping sensors
    together. Third, it is scalable, as it can be applied to WSNs of any size. This
    approach has the potential to be used in a variety of WSN applications, such as
    environmental monitoring, industrial automation, and healthcare. In addition to
    the approach proposed in [11], there are a number of other techniques that can
    be used to mitigate data loss within WSNs. One approach is to use a routing protocol
    that is specifically designed for WSNs. In the paper [12], a routing approach
    is proposed based on the MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol that is specifically
    designed for WSNs. Their approach takes into account the unique characteristics
    of WSNs, such as the limited energy resources of sensor nodes and the unreliable
    nature of wireless communication. Another approach to mitigating data loss is
    to use error-detection and -correction techniques. In [13], a comparative analysis
    is conducted between scenarios where sensor transmission times run in parallel
    and scenarios with shifts in transmission times. They presented a method for detecting
    such shifts in data transmission. This method can be used to correct errors in
    data transmission and improve the reliability of WSNs. Another approach adopted
    in the literature to prevent data loss is to forward the data to the multipath
    debris. In the study [14], two separate routes were created using different nodes
    for data transmission. In order to balance the data load on the network elements
    and extend the life of the network, prior studies [15,16] identified alternative
    data paths with convolutional heuristics. Using ant colony optimization, another
    study [17] avoided routing over high energy-consuming sensors in the network.
    One study [18] appointed a certain number of sensor group heads on the network
    to minimize the energy consumed during data transfer between sensors. The sensors
    that are members of the group select the sensor with the highest remaining energy
    and the closest one for the next step and transmit their data with multi-step
    routing per group. The group leader reduces the energy consumption of the network
    by forwarding the data to the gateway with a pre-calculated route. Identifying
    multiple paths to reduce data loss increases the amount of energy consumed, while
    identifying some nodes on a group basis throughout the entire network lifetime
    concentrates the data load on these nodes. In this work, in order to prevent data
    loss, our two-stage models find the best path to reach the gateway with minimum
    number of hops. Since the proposed optimization models detect the least energy-consuming
    paths in each period, nodes do not need to serve as a group for the entire network
    lifetime. In the timing-based TDMA protocol, each network element is assigned
    a time slot to transmit its data. Network elements sleep to conserve energy during
    periods when they are not transmitting data. In the contention-based protocol,
    if the network element does not receive any signal during the random waiting period,
    it sends a control packet to the neighboring network elements and goes into sleep
    mode until the next transmission period. Network elements that go into sleep mode
    increase the likelihood of delays in data transmission. A previous study [11]
    randomly grouped the sensors to overcome the shortcomings of these two protocols,
    reducing the number of sensors listening to the network and saving energy. According
    to this study, the sensor that wants to transmit data to a sensor in a different
    group will perform this transmission as long as the target group is active. There
    are different studies on time and contention-based protocols in the literature
    [19,20,21]. In this work, the online energy optimization model determines the
    the least energy consuming data transmission paths. The data routing and scheduling
    of sensors’ active/sleep periods have been investigated in the literature to minimize
    energy use in data transmission in the network [22]. In [23], the aim is to provide
    energy efficiency by grouping active/sleep modes and aimed to transmit data to
    the gateway as soon as possible. [24] suggested different sleep modes for energy
    saving: in deep sleep, the sensor is completely off until a certain time, while
    in light sleep it is ready to wake up. The authors of [10] proposed a mixed integer
    linear model for different purposes such as shortest data transmission path and
    maximum data transport. In this model and [25], it has been observed that the
    sensor that transmits data directly to a gateway has a high amount of data and
    is the fastest depleted of energy in the network. In [26], three different heuristic
    routing approaches are compared: proactive routing, which is determined and not
    updated, reactive routing, which is updated as needed, and opportunistic routing,
    where each sensor controls data transmission. When a sensor is de-energized, data
    sensing/transmission tasks cannot be loaded on the network. According to [27],
    a data orientation towards energy efficiency is provided by clustering the sensors.
    The closest study to the proposed work is [28], which detects the same type of
    data, covers the entire area, and consists of sensors with different technical
    characteristics that will transmit data to the gateway with the least energy,
    determining expenses and routes. The main differences of this work to the current
    study can be listed as follows. (1) Network elements include an actuator and routers
    in addition to sensors and receivers. (2) Sensors detect different types of data
    and have different data detection and transmission. In periods, (3) data collected
    from the field are evaluated; then, commands will be sent to the actuator by the
    gateway, and the data flow must be determined bidirectionally in order for the
    gateways to give data confirmation to the network elements and send sleep/active
    commands. (4) The data will be forwarded by a computer/online method based on
    gateway recognition. (5) A minimum number of boxes (grouping), so that the network
    elements can withstand environmental factors, will be placed on the field. In
    our preliminary work [3], we have considered a centralized mathematical formulation
    for a physical layer, MAC layer, and network layer of a WSN for a monitoring mission.
    In this work, we extend our approach in the following ways: (1) we consider the
    problem in two separate stages, i.e., offline network deployment and online energy
    operations models, (2) we propose a novel approach to handle data loss in transmission
    that can propose alternative data route paths even if some of the network elements
    fail, (3) we aim to collect different types of sensors in one protective box including
    a common battery and transmitter. That is, the sensors will share the same limited
    energy and the transmitter bandwidth. Based on the observation that large data
    packets sent at frequent intervals shorten the battery life of the sensors, data
    compression has been evaluated in the literature to reduce energy use [29,30].
    In [31], the amount of energy lost during data transmission is reduced by decreasing
    the amount of data accepted or transmitted with the proposed compression algorithm.
    In this work, the main approach to reduce energy use in data transmission will
    be to transmit data from the shortest distance to the gateway, with the secondary
    goal being to transmit sensor measurements in small data packets. Different modules
    have been used in the literature for the embedded system and mechanical design
    of sensor networks. On the other hand, [32] provided the communication in the
    sensor network they created to observe an agricultural field with the XBee protocol
    at 2.4 GHz radio frequency in the ISM band. Atmega8L micro-controller, XBee RF
    module, EEPROM memory are located in the sensor nodes to save measurement data
    and prevent data loss. [33] selected the MSP430F1611, which is known for its ultra-low
    power consumption, and the nRF24L01 module, which is known for its ultra-low,
    mid-range and low power consumption, as well as a micro-controller for a low-power
    sensor node known for its low cost and for working in the ISM band 2.4 GHz frequency
    as a radio transceiver. The nRF24L01 and the micro-controller are put into sleep
    mode with the sleep algorithms created during the periods when there is no data
    flow. However, the hardware and software of the gateways where the data were collected
    were not examined. Comparing in detail different sensor network designs in terms
    of power consumption and data capacity, [34] designed a low-power sensor node.
    In this design, ultra-low power consumption MSP430F1611 and TI250CC are used as
    a micro-controller and radio transceiver, respectively (Texas Instruments, Dallas,
    TX, USA, 2020). While the power requirement of the node board is provided by AAA
    alkaline batteries, no design is recommended for the gateway. This work will use
    LoRa operating module, EEPRROM for sensors and actuator, and SD card memory for
    router and gateways. In the work, separate electronic board designs will be made
    so that the sensors, actuator, routers and gateways in the network can work with
    low energy consumption. In the 3D site, the external mechanical design that will
    protect the sensors against conditions such as high temperature, humidity, dust
    for the life of the network. 3. System Description WSNs consist of low-cost sensors
    with limited communication, sensing, and storage capabilities. Today, with the
    widespread use of technology, WSNs are used in various fields such as collecting
    health data, scanning military areas, monitoring natural life and environmental
    conditions, and agriculture [25]. Many agricultural and livestock applications
    of sensor networks have been used to report the ongoing behavior of animals, to
    report a possible abnormality, and to obtain more efficiency from animals and
    plants by measuring the humidity and temperature of the environment [35]. The
    sensor network discussed in this work basically consists of the network elements
    such as sensor node, actuator, and gateway as shown in Figure 1. The sensor node
    contains different types of sensors and a router, shown in Figure 2. Figure 1.
    Smart farm area. Figure 2. Contents of a sensor node. (a) shows temperature sensor,
    (b) shows humidity sensor, (c) shows sunbathing time sensor, and (d) shows a router.
    The sensors take measurements in the field at regular intervals and transmit data
    packets to the routers or sensors with which they can communicate to transmit
    information to a gateway. Routers are able to communicate with other network elements.
    However, they are not capable of sensing data in the field. Radio frequency (RF)
    provides the communication amnong the sensor nodes, routers, and the gateways.
    The network data are collected in cloud storage and evaluated by a decision maker,
    and commands are sent to the actuators via gateways by using RF communication.
    According to these commands, actuators perform functions such as irrigation and
    lighting. The target region includes N candidate points that are collected in
    the set 𝐍={1,…,𝑁} . A point 𝑗∈𝐍 is a candidate position to deploy a network element,
    and also a location that a sensor measurement is requested from. There are K types
    of sensors which are indexed by the set 𝐊 𝟏 ={1,…,𝐾} . There are different types
    of network nodes: a type s node, i.e., a sensor node, which includes multiple
    sensors located at the same point, a type a node is an actuator, a type r node
    is a router, and a type g node represents a gateway. The node types are collected
    in the set 𝐊 𝟐 ={𝑠,𝑎,𝑟,𝑔} . A sensor (𝑗,𝑘) represents a type 𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 sensor deployed
    at point 𝑗∈𝐍 . A type k sensor can sense a point 𝑗∈𝐍 if it falls into the sensing
    range 𝑟 𝑠 𝑘 , and it can send data to other network elements (sensor, router,
    gateway) within the communication range 𝑟 𝑐 𝑘 . As illustrated in Figure 3, the
    sensor (𝑗,𝑘) can take measurements for the point 𝑝 1 since it is inside the sensing
    range 𝑟 𝑠 𝑘 . After processing the collected data of the point 𝑝 1 , the sensor
    (𝑗,𝑘) can transmit the data packet to the sensor 𝑠 1 , which is inside the communication
    range 𝑟 𝑐 𝑘 . Note that the sensor (𝑗,𝑘) can neither sense the point 𝑝 2 , nor
    can it transmit data to the sensor 𝑠 2 since they are beyond the corresponding
    operation ranges. Figure 3. Sensing and communication ranges of a sensor. A sensor
    (𝑗,𝑘) costs 𝑐 𝑗𝑘 monetary units with an initial battery energy of 𝐸 𝑘 mAh. A sensor
    node is no longer a member of a WSN when its battery is over. On the other hand,
    a sensor node can save significant amount of energy by going to the sleep mode
    when it is not sensing or transmitting data, which prolongs its lifetime. A sensor
    node (𝑗,𝑘) for 𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 consumes 𝑒 𝑎 𝑘 mAh to stay active without sensing data (Figure
    4a), and 𝑒 𝑠𝑟 𝑘 mAh to sleep for one period (Figure 4c). In the sleep mode, a
    sensor cannot measure, receive or transmit data, but it listens to a wake-up signal
    from a gateway [36]. A type k sensor needs 𝑒 𝑠 𝑘 mAh to collect and process data
    in a period. A sensor node (𝑗,𝑘) spends 𝑒 𝑎𝑟 𝑘 mAh to receive unit data from other
    nodes, and 𝑒 𝑐 𝑘 mAh to transmit unit data to other nodes (Figure 4b). The amount
    of data a type k sensor can transmit per unit of time is limited by the bandwidth
    𝛽 𝑘 which is utilized by the sensor’s own data and data from other sensors. Figure
    4. Energy parameters of a sensor. We aim is to deploy gateways to transmit the
    collected network data to the cloud. It is assumed that the communication range
    of the gateways is large enough to communicate with all elements in the field.
    It is also accepted that the battery energy of the gateways is sufficient to supply
    the entire planning horizon. Due to these superior features of gateways, their
    costs are higher than sensors and they are found to be in less number in the network.
    The number of elements that can be used in the network must be within the limited
    budget B. A sensor network is expected to operate smoothly in the field for a
    long time. It is considered that the network elements are kept in a protective
    box in order to withstand environmental conditions such as rain and sun. In this
    work, our target is to group the network elements using as few boxes as possible.
    We also aim to plan the sleep and active mode periods of the sensors in the best
    way in order to use the limited 𝐸 𝑘 battery energy for the longest time. Another
    objective is to determine the number and locations of the network elements that
    can sense the terrain by communicating with each other for the longest time within
    the constrained B budget. The sub-problems addressed in the network can be listed
    as follows: Deployment of the network elements: Among the candidate positions,
    the best sensor nodes locations are determined to monitor the target points with
    desired quality. The connectivity of the network is supported by the deployment
    of routers. The gateways should be located to oversee each network element. The
    decisions should be made within the budget limitation. Sensor activity scheduling:
    In order to save the battery energy, a sensor can go into the sleep mode, which
    may harm the coverage requirements and the network connectivity. The energy-optimized
    activity schedule of the sensor nodes should be determined to obey the connected
    coverage restrictions during the planning horizon. Data routing: The sensor data
    should be routed to a gateway at each time period. As the network gets larger,
    direct communication with a gateway becomes impossible due to the node communication
    ranges. In that case, the data can follow a multi-hop node-to-gateway transmission
    route. As the number of hops increases, the transmission failure probability gets
    higher due to the bandwidth limitations, interference and noise in the environment.
    This may end up with the data loss which is undesired. Then, data loss-aware energy-optimized
    data transmission routes should be generated. 4. Sensor Network Design In order
    to design a WSN, we first introduce mathematical formulations to optimize the
    network deployment, activity scheduling, and data routing operations in Section
    4.1 and implement on a hardware in Section 4.2. 4.1. Mathematical Models We consider
    the WSN optimization problem at two stages: the offline network deployment (OND)
    model given in Section 4.1.1 and the online energy optimization (OEO) model explained
    in Section 4.1.2. The OND model deploys the network agents, such as sensors, actuators,
    routers, and gateways, within the target region at the beginning of the monitoring
    mission. OND aims to minimize the deployment cost while ensuring that the deployed
    sensors are sufficient to monitor the target region within a desired sensing and
    communication quality. In order to maximize the network lifetime L, OND deploys
    redundant sensor nodes in a WSN. Secondly, the OEO model considers the agent locations
    determined by the OND model and aims to determine the minimum energy consuming
    sleep/active schedule of the sensors while satisfying the connected coverage requirements
    of the mission. Being an online model, OEO also determines the minimum energy
    consuming sensor to gateway data transmission routes at each period t. Finally,
    the network lifetime can be determined as the first period L at which the OEO
    model fails to generate a feasible solution. That is the time at which the battery
    energy of some sensor nodes are depleted and the alive nodes cannot cover the
    region in a connected manner. We summarize the parameters and decision variables
    in the OND and OEO models in Table 1. Table 1. List of symbols. 4.1.1. Offline
    Network Deployment Model The OND model deploys the sensor nodes to monitor each
    target point while forming a connected network with the other sensor nodes and
    routers with minimum budget usage. In order to prolong the network lifetime and
    ensure the existence of data transmission routes to a gateway, OND locates redundant
    sensor nodes in the network. An actuator is a fixed equipment such as an irrigation
    valve or a greenhouse light. Hence, we assume that the actuator locations are
    known and not modeled. That is, the OND model aims to find the optimum locations
    of sensor nodes for each sensor type, routers and gateways. The binary decision
    variable 𝑥 𝑗𝑘 indicates if there is a sensor or a router ( 𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 ∪{𝑟} ) at point
    j or not. Similarly, the binary variable 𝑥 ¯ 𝑗 represents the gateway deployment
    decision at point j. If there is a node deployed at point j, then the binary variable
    𝑦 ¯ 𝑗 is one and zero otherwise. The OND objective function (1) minimizes the
    total deployment cost of sensors, routers, and gateways. In particular, the parameter
    𝑐 𝑘 represents the cost of a type k element, 𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 ∪{𝑟,𝑔} and 𝑐 ¯ 𝑗 is the fixed
    cost of deploying a node at point 𝑗∈𝐍 . In order to protect the hardware from
    harsh environmental conditions, such as rain and high temperature, we consider
    inserting network elements in a protective box. Hence, 𝑐 ¯ 𝑗 can be considered
    as the fixed box cost and the decision variable 𝑦 ¯ 𝑗 aims to minimize the number
    of utilized nodes in the network. min s.t. ∑ 𝑗∈𝐍,𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 ∪{𝑟} 𝑐 𝑘 𝑥 𝑗𝑘 + ∑ 𝑗∈𝐍

    (5) 𝑥 𝑗𝑘 , 𝑥 ¯ 𝑗 , 𝑦 ¯ 𝑗 ∈{0,1}𝑗∈𝐍,𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 ∪{𝑟} (6) Constraint (2) limits the total
    deployment cost with the available budget B. The binary parameter 𝑎 𝑗𝑘𝑖 indicates
    whether a sensor (𝑗,𝑘) can sense point i or not. Constraints (3) guarantee that
    the deployed sensors can satisfy the coverage requirement 𝑓 ¯ 𝑖𝑘 of a point i
    by a type k sensor. Here, the parameter 𝑓 ¯ 𝑖𝑘 picked is greater than the true
    coverage requirement of a point i. This allows the deployment of redundant sensor
    nodes in the network within the available budget B, which can help to maximize
    the network lifetime L. The binary parameter 𝑏 𝑖𝑙𝑗 indicates whether a sensor
    (𝑖,𝑙) can communicate with a node at point j or not. The gateways should communicate
    with each network element in order to command them for the active/sleep modes
    and routing rules. Constraints (4) deploy the gateways to communicate with all
    target points. In order to secure the network connectivity, we assume that each
    sensor or router node should communicate with at least 𝛼 different nodes as dictated
    by Constraints (5). Finally, Constraints (6) set the binary restrictions on the
    decision variables. 4.1.2. Online Energy Optimization Model The OEO model determines
    the active sensor nodes and generates the minimum energy consuming data transmission
    routes from each node to a gateway at each time period t by considering the bandwidth
    limitations of the nodes. OEO activates the sensor nodes without redundancy, which
    are sufficient to satisfy the coverage requirements of the target points. The
    efficient activity scheduling and energy-aware data routing of the OEO model allows
    the maximization of the network lifetime L. In the OEO model, the binary decision
    variable 𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 is one if a sensor node (𝑗,𝑘) is active at period t and zero otherwise.
    The continuous decision variable 𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑘𝑡 shows the amount of data sent from a
    sensor (𝑖,𝑙) to sensor (𝑗,𝑘) at period t. The energy consumption of a node (𝑗,𝑘)
    in a period t is decided by the continuous variable 𝐸 𝑗𝑘𝑡 , which can be given
    in Equation (7). 𝐸 𝑗𝑘𝑡 = 𝑒 𝑠𝑟 𝑘 (1− 𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 )+ 𝑒 𝑎 𝑘 𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑎𝑟 𝑘 ∑ (𝑖,𝑙)∈𝐍× 𝐊
    𝟐 𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑘𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑐 𝑘 ∑ (𝑖,𝑙)∈𝐍× 𝐊 𝟐 𝑦 𝑗𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑡 + ∑ 𝑗∈𝐍 𝑒 𝑠 𝑘 ′ 𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 𝑥 𝑗𝑘 (7) The third
    term in Equation (7) is the inflow energy, fourth term is the outflow energy,
    and fifth term is the sensing and processing of the sensor (𝑗,𝑘) . The energy
    consumption 𝐸 𝑗𝑟𝑡 of a router node (𝑗,𝑟) in a period t depends on the sleep and
    active modes, total inflow and total outflow as shown in Equation (8). 𝐸 𝑗𝑟𝑡 =
    𝑒 𝑠𝑟 𝑟 (1− 𝑧 𝑗𝑟𝑡 )+ 𝑒 𝑎 𝑟 𝑧 𝑗𝑟𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑎𝑟 𝑟 ∑ (𝑖,𝑙)∈𝐍× 𝐊 𝟐 𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑟𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑐 𝑟 ∑ (𝑖,𝑙)∈𝐍×
    𝐊 𝟐 𝑦 𝑗𝑟𝑖𝑙𝑡 (8) Equation (9) gives the energy consumption 𝐸 𝑗𝑎𝑡 of an actuator
    node (𝑗,𝑎) in a period t as the summation of sleep, active and transmit energy
    consumption. We assume that an actuator does not operate as a relay node, but
    only transmits its own data. 𝐸 𝑗𝑎𝑡 = 𝑒 𝑠𝑟 𝑎 (1− 𝑧 𝑗𝑎𝑡 )+ 𝑒 𝑎 𝑎 𝑧 𝑗𝑎𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑐 𝑎 ∑
    (𝑖,𝑙)∈𝐍× 𝐊 𝟐 𝑦 𝑗𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑡 (9) We assume that a gateway (𝑗,𝑔) is active throughout the
    mission. Then, the energy consumption 𝐸 𝑗𝑔𝑡 of a gateway (𝑗,𝑔) in a period t includes
    the active and inflow energy consumption as in Equation (10). 𝐸 𝑗𝑔𝑡 = 𝑒 𝑎 𝑔 +
    𝑒 𝑎𝑟 𝑔 ∑ (𝑖,𝑙)∈𝐍× 𝐊 𝟐 𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑔𝑡 (10) The OEO objective (12) aims to minimize the
    total energy consumption at a period t. Being an online model, OEO takes the remaining
    energy 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑚 𝑗𝑘𝑡 of a node (𝑗,𝑘) as an input to optimize the energy consumption
    𝐸 𝑗𝑘𝑡 in the current period t. Equation (11) calculates the remaining energy of
    a node (𝑗,𝑘)∈𝐍× 𝐊 𝟐 at period t iteratively when the energy consumption 𝐸 𝑗𝑘(𝑡−1)
    is given. 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑚 𝑗𝑘𝑡 = 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑚 𝑗𝑘(𝑡−1) − 𝐸 𝑗𝑘(𝑡−1) (11) Constraints (13) set an upper
    bound 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑚 𝑗𝑘𝑡 on the energy consumption of a node (𝑗,𝑘) . Constraints (14) allow
    to activate a node if it has been deployed by the OND model, i.e.,  𝑥 𝑗𝑘 =1 .
    Constraints (15) activate sensor nodes to satisfy the coverage requirement of
    a point 𝑖∈𝐍 . According to Constraints (16), there should be at least 𝛼 many active
    nodes in the neighborhood of an active node (𝑖,𝑙) for connectivity. min s.t. ∑

    (17)–(23) regulate the inflow and outflow of a node. In order to send a data packet
    from a node (𝑖,𝑙) to a node (𝑗,𝑘) , the point j should be within the communication
    range of the node (𝑖,𝑙) , i.e., 𝑏 𝑖𝑙𝑗 =1 , and the sender and receiver nodes should
    be active at the same time, i.e., 𝑧 𝑖𝑙𝑡 = 𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 =1 . Constraints (17) and (18)
    satisfy these requirements by setting a sufficiently large upper bound 𝑀 ¯ on
    the flow amount 𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑘𝑡 . One can pick 𝑀 ¯ as the multiplication of the total
    number of sensors with the maximum data packet size. A node (𝑖,𝑙) cannot send
    data to itself as in Constraints (19). A sensor node (𝑗,𝑘) generates ℎ 𝑗𝑘 unit
    of data in an active period. Constraints (20) set the balance between the inflow,
    generated data and the outflow for an active sensor node (𝑗,𝑘) . A type 𝑘∈{𝑟,𝑎,𝑔}
    node does not sense data. Hence, the inflow should be equal to the outflow as
    in Constraints (21). Note that, the energy consumption increases as the data transmission
    route gets longer. That is, the OEO model generates min-hop data route which decreases
    the probability of transmission failure among the nodes. As a result, the flow
    constraints avoid data loss by ensuring the existence of an energy efficient and
    min-hop data transmission route from each active sensor node to a gateway. A node
    (𝑗,𝑘) has a bandwidth 𝛽 𝑘 limiting the data flow on the node. The bandwidth 𝛽
    𝑠 of a sensor node is utilized by the inflow from the other nodes, sensor’s own
    data and the outflow to the other nodes as in Constraints (22). For a type 𝑘∈{𝑟,𝑎,𝑔}
    node, the bandwidth 𝛽 𝑘 is utilized only by the inflow and outflow data as in
    Constraints (23). Constraints (24) ensure the non-negativity of the flow variable
    𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑘𝑡 and energy consumption 𝐸 𝑗𝑘𝑡 . Finally, Constraints (25) set the binary
    restriction on the activity schedule variable 𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 . 4.2. Hardware Implementation
    To evaluate the performance of the OND and OEO models discussed earlier, an embedded
    system emphasizing low power consumption has developed. The design process, guided
    by mathematical modeling principles, yielded two primary components: gateway and
    sensor nodes. The system comprises two distinct sensor nodes, each equipped with
    different sensor types, while a singular gateway oversees their operational activities.
    The sensor nodes were purposefully diversified to accommodate various sensing
    functions. Communication between the gateway and sensor nodes is facilitated by
    a wireless communication protocol. This designed system allows for a comprehensive
    examination of its functionality, efficiency, and communication protocols, particularly
    focusing on the wireless connectivity that enables seamless data transfer between
    the gateway and sensor nodes. Gateway Design To regulate the operational modes
    of the sensor nodes, a gateway has been designed and implemented. The hardware
    configuration of the gateway incorporates an Atmega 328p micro-controller coupled
    with an E32 LoRa module, serving for wireless communication. The micro-controller
    possesses the intrinsic capability to interface seamlessly with a diverse array
    of sensors, encompassing functionalities such as humidity, temperature, and pressure,
    among others. Based on the Figure 5, the connections between LoRa and the micro-controller
    have been established. The gateway, in conjunction with the software, monitors
    the operational status of the sensor nodes and facilitates the presentation of
    sensor measurements to users. To ensure low power consumption in the model, the
    sensor nodes do not continuously measure, as explained in Section 4.3. Instead,
    the gateway intermittently signals the sensor nodes, prompting them to take measurements
    and transmit the data back to the gateway. In this system design, two sensor nodes
    and a gateway communicate at frequencies of 432 MHz and 433 MHz over the second
    and third channels, respectively. Using the developed software, the gateway sends
    a signal to the sensor nodes in sleep mode, instructing them to wake up at specific
    intervals (initially set at every 30 min for the first test phase). The message
    transmitted contains the intended operation, such as taking a measurement or configuring
    the node for type-1, type-2, or gateway functions. Subsequently, after receiving
    measurements from the sensor nodes, the gateway transmits this data to the user.
    Figure 5. Block diagram of the gateway design. 4.3. Sensor Node Design In this
    study, the SHT3X air temperature and humidity sensor were utilized in the sensor
    nodes. Alongside this specified sensor, the Atmega 328p served as the microprocessor
    for the sensor node. Similar to the gateway, the same LoRa module facilitated
    wireless communication. The sensor node operated with low power consumption, necessitating
    the development of different software tailored to the sensor node’s functionality.
    The block diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the proposed circuit for the adaptive
    network. The first sensor node utilized the SHT3X sensor for monitoring air temperature
    and humidity, making it suitable for outdoor applications. The Atmega 328p acted
    as the micro-controller, and a LoRa module served for wireless communication.
    Power was supplied by four AA batteries, providing approximately 5.5 volts. The
    sensor node was securely housed in a waterproof IP65 box designed for outdoor
    environments. This sensor node communicated with the gateway on the second LoRa
    channel at around 432 MHz frequency. Specialized software was developed to achieve
    low power consumption in the sensor nodes. The sensor node operated initially
    in sleep mode, waiting for a wake-up signal from the gateway. Upon receiving the
    wake-up signal, the system became active, measurements were taken, data was sent
    to the gateway, and then the sensor node returned to the sleep mode, awaiting
    the next wake-up signal. This operation minimized power consumption. To ensure
    access to measured data under any conditions and prevent data loss during power
    outages, a memory system was implemented using EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable
    Read-Only Memory). The EEPROM library facilitated reading and writing bytes. The
    Atmega 328p micro-controller had 1024 bytes of EEPROM memory, enabling effective
    recording of measurements. With the developed algorithm for this memory system,
    the measurements for 4 bytes are compressed to 1 byte. Now from memory, one byte
    is used for measuring temperature or humidity, and two bytes are used for the
    index value. In other words, a total of four bytes of memory are spent for one
    reading. A total of 192 bytes of memory are used in a twenty-four-hour measurement
    performed at intervals of thirty minutes. Thus, approximately five days of data
    can be stored in this memory. In the same way, a similar algorithm has been applied
    in recording humidity values. Thanks to this method, the memory recording process
    is designed to be most effective by compressing the data. Figure 6. Block diagram
    of the embedded system designed for the implementation of the proposed adaptive
    network. 5. Simulation Results In this section, we conduct experiments to test
    our hardware design and estimate the system parameters in Section 5.1, and utilize
    our mathematical models to implement the hardware on a real-size agricultural
    field in Section 5.2. 5.1. Hardware Results The current consumption of the circuit
    during operation is shown in detail in Table 2. The sensor node consumes 6 mA
    when in sleep mode, 31 mA when sensing and transmitting, 89 mA only when transmitting,
    and 21 mA only when receiving data. Table 2. Current consumption of the circuit
    during operation. Figure 7 shows that the simulation results for the sensor’s
    varying current consumption levels over time in different operating modes with
    a fixed 5 Volt input. As shown, the sensor switches between sleep, receive, measure,
    and transmit modes, each characterized by unique current profiles. During the
    sleep mode, the sensors operate in an energy-efficient standby mode, drawing minimal
    power. When switching to the receiving mode, the current noticeably increases,
    indicating the power requirements related to obtaining the signal. In the measurement
    mode, dedicated to measuring the humidity and temperature values, an average current
    level is displayed. Then, in the transmission mode, current consumption peaks,
    reflecting the increased energy demands during data transmission. These results
    highlight the importance of adjusting power management at each stage of energy
    efficiency. Figure 7. The trace of the current consumption during operation. In
    this research, an innovative model has been introduced to address the specific
    requirements of an adaptive sensor network tailored for low-power Internet of
    Things (IoT) applications. The proposed architecture focuses on the integration
    of configurable sensor nodes, strategically designed to achieve an unparalleled
    level of power efficiency across various application scenarios. To achieve this
    goal, the model parameters and formulations essential for the seamless functioning
    of the proposed system were meticulously derived, and these theoretical aspects
    were subsequently translated into practicality by implementing them at the hardware
    level. Taking a step further, the research endeavors included rigorous field testing
    of the implemented network. Through a series of comprehensive experiments and
    real-world simulations, empirical evidence was gathered to substantiate the efficacy
    and viability of the proposed method. In Figure 8 and Figure 9, the hardware implemented
    in the field is showcased. The results obtained from extensive testing unequivocally
    affirm that the adaptive sensor network, with its configurable nodes and optimized
    power efficiency, stands as a promising solution for low-power IoT applications.
    This study contributes not only to the theoretical foundations of adaptive sensor
    networks but also provides practical insights that pave the way for the advancement
    and implementation of energy-efficient solutions in the burgeoning field of IoT
    technologies. Figure 8. The implemented hardware placed on the field. Figure 9.
    The implementation of a sensor node. In the figures, a specific 10-min interval
    on 18 December 2023 was selected for detailed examination of both temperature
    and humidity data. The time-stamped temperature and humidity values were extracted
    and plotted to visualize their variations within this specified timeframe. Figure
    10 and Figure 11 present the dynamic changes in both temperature and humidity
    at regular intervals during this 10 min period. The x-axis represents the timestamp,
    while the y-axis corresponds to the temperature (in degrees Celsius) and humidity
    values, respectively. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the concurrent
    fluctuations of temperature and humidity, offering a nuanced understanding of
    their interplay within this short yet significant temporal window. By examining
    both parameters, a more holistic view of the environmental conditions during this
    specific time segment is achieved. Figure 10. Time-stamped humidity data. Figure
    11. Time-stamped temperature data. 5.2. Mathematical Model Results In this section,
    we provide the details of a case study to illustrate our OND and OEO models. A
    sample field is determined with the dimensions 200×250 m. In Figure 12, the eight
    yellow dots indicate the target points to take sensor measurements and also the
    candidate positions to deploy network elements, i.e., sensor node, router, and
    gateway. Figure 12. Sample field. Two different sensor types are used in the model,
    temperature and humidity sensor. Their communication radii are equal to each other
    and 100 m and their sensing radii are 30 m. Considering the candidate points and
    the sensing radii of the sensors, each sensor can only detect the point where
    it is placed. Therefore, the parameter 𝑎 𝑗𝑘 𝑗 ′ is calculated as shown in Equation
    (26). 𝑎 𝑗𝑘 𝑗 ′ ={ 1 0 if𝑗= 𝑗 ′ if𝑗≠ 𝑗 ′ (26) Since the communication radius of
    a router used in the model is 500 m, it can communicate with any of the candidate
    locations in the target region. That is, for a router, we have the parameter 𝑏
    𝑗𝑟 𝑗 ′ =1 for any 𝑗, 𝑗 ′ ∈𝐍 . For a sensor of type 𝑘∈{1,2} , the parameter 𝑏 𝑗𝑘
    𝑗 ′ values are the same due to the identical communication ranges and given as
    in Equation (27). 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 𝑗 ′ = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨                     1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 0 if𝑗=1and 𝑗 ′ ∈{1,2,3} if𝑗=2and 𝑗 ′ ∈{1,2,3,4} if𝑗=3and 𝑗 ′ ∈{1,2,3,4,7}
    if𝑗=4and 𝑗 ′ ∈{2,3,4} if𝑗=5and 𝑗 ′ ∈{5,8} if𝑗=6and 𝑗 ′ ∈{6,7} if𝑗=7and 𝑗 ′ ∈{3,6,7}
    if𝑗=8and 𝑗 ′ ∈{5,8} otherwise (27) In our models, we pick the coverage requirement
    𝑓 ¯ 𝑖𝑘 of a point j as shown in Equation (28). For connectivity quality, an active
    node should communicate with at least 𝛼=1 many active nodes. The total available
    budget is B = 10,000 TL. The cost of each network element is summarized in Table
    3. 𝑓 ¯ 𝑖𝑘 ={ 0 1 if𝑖=8 otherwise (28) Table 3. Cost of network elements. For the
    introduced instance, the OND model generates the solution in Figure 13. According
    to the results, there is a gateway deployed at point 8. As we mentioned before,
    the actuator location is given and fixed. In our case, there are two irrigation
    valves in the field as depicted in Figure 13. Each of the first seven candidate
    points houses a sensor node including the temperature and humidity sensors. Figure
    13. Solution of the OND model. Moreover, the OND model deployed a router at points
    3 and 7 to achieve the connectivity requirements. For instance, the router at
    point 3 can collect the data of the neighboring sensor nodes and transmit to the
    gateway energy efficiently. That is, the sensor node at point 3 may not consume
    energy to route the neighbor node’s data and continue with the sensing operations
    for a longer time. The gateway at point 8 is out of the communication range of
    the sensor node at point 7. Then, the OND model locates a router at point 7 to
    link the sensor node with the gateway. Equations (29), (30), and (31) summarize
    the optimal values of the variables 𝑥 𝑗𝑘 , 𝑥 ¯ 𝑗 , and 𝑦 ¯ 𝑗 found by the OND
    model, respectively. Overall, there are seven temperature sensors, seven humidity
    sensors, two routers, and one gateway deployed with a total cost of 9525 TL. 𝑥
    𝑗𝑘 ={ 1 0 for𝑗∈{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}and∀𝑘 for𝑗=8and∀𝑘 (29) 𝑥 ¯ 𝑗 ={ 1 0 for𝑗=8 for𝑗∈{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
    (30) 𝑦 ¯ 𝑗 ={ 1 0 for𝑗∈{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} for𝑗=8 (31) In the second stage of the
    WSN operations control, the OEO model determines an activity schedule for each
    of the network elements and constructs the energy-efficient node-to-gateway data
    transmission routes. Figure 14 demonstrates the one-period solution of the OEO
    model based on the network deployment decision of the OND model. According to
    the solution, each sensor node continuously operates in the active mode until
    its battery is over. Figure 14 visualizes the node-to-gateway data routes with
    the labels of flow amounts on the arcs. Figure 14. Solution of the OEO model.
    As mentioned in Section 4.2, an active sensor generates a data packet of size
    four bytes, i.e., ℎ 𝑗𝑘 =4 for each period. Based on the energy measurements of
    hardware simulations in Section 5.1, the 4xAA batteries provide 3000 mAh initial
    energy for each node ( 𝐸 𝑗 =3000 for 𝑗∈𝐍 ). In our simulations, we pick identical
    coverage requirements 𝑓 ¯ 𝑖𝑘 and 𝑓 𝑖𝑘 for the OND and OEO models, respectively.
    We assume that the bandwidth of each node is sufficient to transmit its own data
    together with the network flow. OEO is an online model which should be solved
    repeatedly at each time period. The iterations terminate when there is no feasible
    solution for the OEO model. Then, the final time period is the network lifetime
    L. In our instance, the OEO model terminates when node 3 fails to satisfy Constraints
    (13), which limits the demanded energy with the remaining node energy. The hardware
    simulations reported in Section 5.1 indicate that a time period is 30 min, and
    a node data receives data for six seconds, and transmits for two seconds. A sensor
    node gathers data and processes within three seconds. A network element remains
    in the sleep mode unless it receives, senses, or transmits during a period. We
    assume that the deployed actuators and the gateway have sufficient battery energy
    to stay active throughout the mission lifetime, i.e., 𝑧 𝑗𝑎𝑡 =1 and 𝑧 𝑗𝑔𝑡 =1 .
    The OEO model reports the optimal schedule for all routers and sensor nodes is
    to keep the active mode, i.e.,  𝑧 𝑗𝑘𝑡 =1 for 𝑘∈ 𝐊 𝟏 ∪{𝑟} for each period t. Equation
    (32) shows the optimal flow amounts and Equation (33) is the optimal node energy
    consumption in a period. 𝑦 𝑖𝑙𝑗𝑘𝑡 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨                   

    for(𝑗,𝑘)∈{(8,𝑟)}and∀𝑡 (33) According to the OEO model results, the network survives
    for a total of 3592 periods ( 𝐿=3592 ). This is equivalent to say that the network
    stays operational for 74 days and approximately 2 months. Figure 15 gives the
    amount of months that each node can operate according to the OEO model results.
    The dotted red line shows which node has minimum lifetime in the model. We observe
    that node 3 consumes the highest energy per period with the shortest lifetime,
    hence dictates the network lifetime. Figure 14 supports this finding since we
    observe that node 3 collects the data of the nodes 1, 2, 4, and transmits to the
    gateway after adding its own data. This corresponds to a data packet of size 384
    bytes, which is the maximum flow in the network. The node lifetimes in Figure
    15 point out that one can improve the network lifetime by deploying a new router
    at node 3 or increasing the initial battery energy of the existing sensor node
    3. Figure 15. Lifetime of each node in terms of months. To sum up, the OND model
    deployed the nodes in a connected way and the OEO model generates minimum energy
    consuming data paths by considering the flow balance constraints, which also minimizes
    the number of hops on the routes. A data transmission attempt may fail due to
    many reasons and can result in a data loss. Hence, as the OEO model minimizes
    the number of hops towards a gateway, it diminishes the data loss probability
    as well. In the end, our two stage WSN control strategy assists the network in
    pursuing the monitoring mission for maximized duration with minimized data loss.
    6. Conclusions In this work, a two-stage mathematical model and its hardware implementation
    are proposed for the problem of distributing sensors on an agricultural land and
    collecting data from field in order to increase crop yield. IoT-based smart agriculture
    technology will facilitate the farmer’s control over the field, minimize the labor
    force and contribute to the production. This work focuses on the implementation
    of wireless sensor networks in agriculture. To efficiently utilize the limited
    energy resources, optimization models have been developed. The objective is to
    minimize network deployment costs using the Offline Network Deployment Model (see
    Section 4.1.1) and optimize the network operation process through the Online Energy
    Optimization Model (see Section 4.1.2). A hardware design for a sensor node and
    a gateway is proposed in order to facilitate the optimal solutions of our mathematical
    formulations (see Section 4.2). The designed hardware is utilized to obtain the
    energy measurement parameters which are then used as the mathematical model simulation
    inputs (see Section 5.1). According to the obtained results, the designed IoT
    network costs 9525 TL and operated for 74 days. Our mathematical models generate
    the optimal locations of the network elements, activity schedules and data transmission
    routes centrally. That is, there is a central decision maker that has full access
    to the network element data at any time period and decide optimally by solving
    the models. However, a WSN can include many network elements which increases the
    number of variables in the mathematical models as well as the computational time.
    Moreover, the failure of the central decision maker hinders the regular operation
    of the network. Another drawback with a centralized model is that obtaining the
    current state of the entire network is not an easy task due to the limited communication
    ranges and different clock times of the network elements. From these perspectives,
    as a future research track, one can consider to design a distributed network model
    in which each network element makes its own decisions by utilizing the local information.
    This type of network control will be scalable and robust to the network element
    failures. On the other hand, such a distributed algorithm can only generate local
    optimal solutions in contrast to the global optimum solution of a centralized
    algorithm as in this research. Author Contributions Conceptualization, E.T., B.K.,

    diffraction 1. Introduction In the present world, sensor materials are essential
    because they allow for the development of sophisticated technologies for sensing
    that are essential to many different sectors and applications [1], [2], [3], [4],
    [5], [6]. These substances are made to change physical, chemical, or biological
    stimuli into quantifiable electrical, optical, or other signals [7,8]. Many researchers
    and scientists have classified cobalt-based nanostructures as a distinct category
    of transition metal oxides due to their exceptional electrical, antibacterial,
    electrochemical, and electrocatalytic capabilities [9]. This allows the materials
    to provide important data for processes related to control, monitoring, and decision-making
    [10], [11], [12]. It''s critical to comprehend the opportunities and difficulties
    related to sensor materials as the need for effective and adaptable sensor systems
    grows [13], [14], [15], [16]. Material''s capacity to identify and measure changes
    in the material''s physical or chemical environment around them characterizes
    its sensing properties [17,18]. Hybrid nanomaterials have recently garnered significant
    interest due to their ability to effectively clean aqueous solutions [19]. Nanosheets
    of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a high nitrogen content were synthesized
    utilizing a low-temperature technique driven by NH4Cl. The structural properties
    of the synthesized g-C3N4 and nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 nanosheets were analyzed using
    X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM),
    transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis,
    and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS) [20]. Based
    on the type of stimulus and the component''s design, several sensing techniques
    are used [16,[21], [22], [23]]. Optic, chemical, piezoelectric, capacitive, and
    resistive interactions are some of these processes [24], [25], [26], [27], [28],
    [29], [30]. In contrast, chemical sensors alter their electrical characteristics
    upon exposure to particular gases or liquids, whereas piezoelectric materials
    provide electrical signals when mechanical stress is applied to them [31], [32],
    [33], [34], [35], [36]. The most appropriate materials for a certain application
    must be chosen after looking into the mechanisms underlying sensing processes
    [37]. Sensing materials are used in many industries, such as transportation, medical,
    agricultural, industrial operations, and environmental monitoring [38], [39],
    [40], [41], [42], [43]. The photocatalytic characteristics of ferrites play a
    significant role in several industrial processes, including the breakdown of alcohols
    and hydrogen peroxide, as well as the oxidation of CO, H2, CH4, chlorobenzene,
    and organic pollutants. By introducing various metals into the lattice structure,
    it is feasible to alter the redox characteristics of the ferrites and fine-tune
    their stability [44]. Precision biomarker detection for early illness diagnosis
    and treatment is made possible in the medical profession by biosensors [45,46].
    While automobile sensors support security and autonomous driving technologies,
    environmental sensors help monitor the quality of the air and water [47]. As technology
    develops, the wide range of applications made possible by the adaptability of
    sensor materials will only grow [1]. Although sensor materials provide many benefits,
    there are also several issues [48]. Enhanced response speed, selectivity, and
    sensitivity are among the requirements [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55],
    [56], [57]. Along with being durable, economical, and frequently eco-friendly,
    materials must also survive challenging working circumstances [58]. With the expansion
    of the Internet of Things (IoT), network connection and interaction with information
    processing devices have also gained significance [59], [60], [61], [62], [63].
    To improve the functionality and dependability of sensor materials, these issues
    must be resolved [64,65]. The future of sensor materials looks promising considering
    these obstacles. Materials with increased performance, durability, and energy
    efficiency should be produced via ongoing research and innovation [66], [67],
    [68]. Highly selective and sensitive sensors with new functions will be possible
    because of the development of nanomaterials and sophisticated production processes
    [1,[69], [70], [71]]. Furthermore, sensor materials are predicted to be essential
    in developing domains like the Internet of Things (IoT), where they will allow
    massive data collection for enhanced automation and decision-making [72,73]. This
    review article has examined the most recent developments, uses, and studies in
    sensor materials. Further, it has also discussed the difficulties and promising
    prospects these materials confront as they examine how they are positioned to
    influence our future. This article wants to provide insightful information on
    the development of sensing technologies and their significant effects on a range
    of businesses and society as they embark on their voyage through the world of
    sensor materials. 2. Material used as a sensor Sensors employ a wide range of
    materials, depending on the type of sensor and its intended purpose. Different
    sensor technologies require different materials to enable their specialized operation.
    Remember that the materials used in a sensor are impacted by the unique needs
    of the sensor''s use, such as sensitivity, accuracy, ambient conditions, and so
    on. Material science advancements are constantly contributing to the creation
    of new and better sensor technologies. Fig. 1 shows some examples of popular sensor
    types and their materials. Download : Download high-res image (495KB) Download

    sensors Sensors are often controlled by measuring voltage or steady current. The
    materials used in the p-n junction determine how the voltage changes with temperature
    [74]. To meet the criteria of high-performance temperature sensors, material selection,
    and sensor design are essential. For the development of flexible temperature sensors,
    materials, particularly nano-based and polymeric materials, are explored [75].
    Numerous applications, including as consumer electronics, automotive systems,
    industrial processes, environmental monitoring, and more, make extensive use of
    them. In addition to differing in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, reaction time,
    and cost, different kinds of temperature sensors use different concepts to detect
    temperature (Table 1). Table 1. E-type, J-type, K-type T-type, and N-type coaxial

    Thermocouples are thermometers that monitor temperature by joining two distinct
    metallic materials at one end. They rely on the Seebeck phenomenon, which develops
    a voltage when there is a temperature differential along the length of the materials.
    [76]. These sensors are made from two different metals joined at one end. When
    there''s a temperature difference between the joined ends, it creates a voltage
    difference, which can be used to measure temperature. Made from combinations of
    different metals or metal alloys, like type-K (chromel/alumel), Type E (chrome
    l/constantan, or Type J (iron/constantan) [77]. There are also various types of
    thermocouples like type-P and type-N [78]. Thermocouples of the type N are frequently
    employed in high-temperature applications. It is renowned for its stability at
    high temperatures and reasonably excellent precision. Two distinct types of metal
    wires, generally Nicrosil, a nickel-chromium-silicon alloy, and Nisil, a nickel-silicon
    alloy, are used to make Type N thermocouples [79,80]. 2.1.2. Resistance temperature
    detectors (RTDs) RTDs make use of temperature-induced variations in electrical
    resistance, where greater temperatures result in increased resistance due to increased
    electron vibrations that obstruct electron transport in conductive materials.
    The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) has been proven to be a useful
    indicator of a material''s temperature sensitivity [85,86]. Thermal response (TCR)
    of the Material, where R(T) is the resistance when the temperature is T, and R(T0)
    is the starting resistance of the test sample when the temperature is T [87].
    Resistance temperature devices (RTDs) monitor temperature by using the temperature-dependent
    electrical resistance of conductors such as silver, platinum, copper, nickel,
    and gold. Materials should be chosen with practical considerations like cost,
    oxidation resistance, and production limitations in mind. Because of its high
    resistivity and well-established temperature coefficient, platinum is suitable
    for 2260–962 °C whereas copper and nickel are cost-effective. Alternatives for
    high temperatures include carbon resistors, germanium, rhodium-iron alloys, and
    ruthenium oxide [88]. 2.1.3. Thermistors Thermistors, often referred to as thermally
    sensitive resistors, are solid-state components with electrical resistance that
    change quickly in reaction to temperature changes. They are positioned as potential
    components for a variety of applications, including communication, instrumentation,
    scientific research, and military technology, because of their simplicity, compactness,
    resilience, extended lifespan, and minimal maintenance needs [89]. The materials
    for negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors are created by the chemical
    interaction of several oxides. Ceramics made of transition metal oxides (manganese,
    cobalt, copper, and nickel) that may create a new crystal phase known as spinel
    are the most widely used materials for temperature ranges between 30 °C and 300
    °C, especially for home and industrial areas. Materials like ZrO2, Y2O, and ThO2
    are employed in high-temperature applications, which are mostly found in autos,
    between 300 °C and 1000 °C [90]. Posistors, sometimes called positive temperature
    coefficient thermistors, can be divided into two categories according to how they
    respond to changes in temperature. With a range of 11 % to over 30 % per degree
    Celsius and a change from a negative to positive coefficient at higher temperatures,
    Type SW posistors show a considerable positive resistance-temperature coefficient.
    Type TC posistors, on the other hand, have a typical linear log resistance vs.
    temperature characteristic with a more tolerable temperature coefficient of between
    3 and 8 % per degree Celsius [91]. 2.2. Pressure sensors Pressure sensors are
    among the earliest and most used microdevices for sensing in commercial, medical,
    and industrial settings. They have been successfully sold [92]. These sensors
    are essential for many different kinds of applications, such as consumer electronics,
    medical devices, and industrial processes. Numerous pressure sensor types measure
    pressure using different principles, and their operational mechanisms allow them
    to be grouped together. 2.2.1. Piezoelectric sensors Piezo is a Greek word that
    means \"press\" or \"squeeze.\" Piezoelectricity (also known as the piezoelectric
    effect) is the existence of an electrical potential across the sides of a crystal
    when mechanical stress is applied by compressing it [93]. Piezoelectricity, which
    is seen in non-centrosymmetric crystals, entails producing electric polarization
    under stress, whereas the opposite phenomenon, which is frequently exploited in
    actuation, produces strain proportionate to an applied electric field [94]. The
    former, or direct effect, is used to sense changes in force, shock- or vibration-induced
    acceleration changes, and pressure dynamics The converse piezoelectric effect
    is the induction of mechanical stress in a piezoelectric material in reaction
    to an external electric field, resulting in deformation in response to applied
    voltage [95,96]. The transduction element, which frequently doubles as the sensing
    element, is made up of one or more piezoelectric components, and it frequently
    combines piezoelectric ceramics with single crystals like quartz, tourmaline,
    gallium orthophosphate, CGG-group crystals, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate,
    and lithium sulfate [97]. There shows the piezoelectric sensor in Fig. 2. Download
    : Download high-res image (92KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. An
    example of a piezoelectric sensor. Natural and man-made piezoelectric materials
    are distinguished. Natural piezoelectric materials include crystals like quartz
    as well as organic materials like silk and wood. Man-made piezoelectric materials
    include quartz-like crystals, ceramics, polymers, and composites, with certain
    crystal classes providing piezoelectric capabilities due to polarization and deformation
    when mechanical stress or an electric field is applied [98]. Perovskite structures
    such as barium titanate and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) are notable among the
    families of man-made ceramics, with specialized preparation techniques leading
    to desirable piezoelectric activity via poling [99]. P(VDF-TrFE) co-polymer and
    ZnO nanomaterial are combined to produce a piezoelectric pressure sensing material
    [100]. Trifluoroethylene gives the co-polymer exceptional piezoelectric characteristics,
    particularly in its β-phase. The characteristics of the co-polymer are improved
    even further by the inclusion of ZnO, a piezoelectric substance devoid of lead.
    This mixture creates a polymer nanocomposite, which is then utilized to construct
    a pressure sensor prototype in order to assess how well it detects changes in
    pressure [101]. 2.2.2. Strain gauge sensors Strain gauges are a common type of
    sensor that is utilized in a wide range of applications where the mechanical deformation
    has to be analyzed, including force sensing and structural health monitoring [102].
    2.3. Optical sensor An optical sensor is a device that measures the actual quantity
    of light rays and transforms it into an electrical signal that can be read by
    a person or an electronic instrument [38]. Their versatility and capacity to provide
    non-contact sensing have led to their widespread use in a variety of applications.
    The optical sensor, which uses the concepts of reflectance, absorbance, fluorescence,
    luminescence, and refractive index, is the most complex sensor when it comes to
    detecting volatile gas [103]. Optical sensors can have different foundations and
    are used in many different domains, such as consumer electronics, medical devices,
    industrial automation, environmental monitoring, and more. 2.3.1. Photodiodes
    Small molecules, polymer compounds (such as P3HT and PC 61 BM), poly(phenylene-vinylene)
    derivatives, fullerenes (such as PC 71 BM), polyfluorene derivatives, phthalocyanines,
    squaraine compounds, and square planar metal bis-dithiolenes are among the materials
    used in photo-detectors, especially organic photo-detectors (OPDs) [104]. In diverse
    combinations, these materials are used to optimize photo-detector performance
    at various wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, from visible to near-infrared.
    These materials are chosen based on their absorption properties [105]. Crystalline
    inorganic semiconductors including silicon, GaP, , GaAs, AlSb, GaN, InGaAs, ZnO,
    HgCdTe, Ge, and CdS are among the many materials utilized in photo-diodes. In
    addition, it addresses topological insulators like bismuth telluride ( ), heterostructure
    photo-diodes with various semiconductor combinations, halide perovskites, and
    colloidal inorganic quantum dots (such as PbS or Ge) [106]. 2.3.2. Photo-transistors
    In order to improve light absorption over particular wavelength ranges, photo-transistor
    devices employ absorption layers made of chalcogenide materials such as Mo , CdS,
    and Se [107]. Due to its low bandgap, the 2D chalcogenide Mo makes it possible
    to detect visible light, while CdS and Se provide efficient absorption in visible
    light areas, enhancing photoresponsivity in photo-transistors. These components
    are essential for enhancing photo-transistor performance in a variety of applications
    [107]. 2.4. Gas sensors Gas sensors with strong sensing qualities that operate
    at room temperature are much more appealing due to their low power consumption,
    good security, and long-term stability [108]. Metal oxides (MOX), carbon nanotubes
    (CNTs), graphene, polymer composites, and metal nanoparticles are typical materials
    used in flexible gas sensors. These substances are selected based on their special
    qualities and appropriateness for identifying particular gases [109]. Semiconductor
    gas sensors monitor changes in the electrical resistance of a poly-crystalline
    sensor element comprised of oxide materials when gases adsorb or react with its
    surface to detect combustible and dangerous gases. Because of their adaptability,
    these sensors may be used to detect gases including NOx, , fluorocarbons, and
    C . In some circumstances, variations in capacitance can also be used to detect
    gases [110,111]. The most recent developments in petrol sensors that save energy
    use the chemo-resistive principle Fig. 3. Gas sensors that are self-heating, low-power
    MEMS-based, and operate at room temperature. Flexible and wearable gas sensors
    and the gas-detecting mechanisms they are connected with are among their uses
    [112]. Download : Download high-res image (450KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. The primary methods and uses of the energy-efficient gas sensors
    [112]. 2.5. Motion sensors A motion sensor is a device that detects physical movement
    or motion in its surroundings and can then initiate a specific response or action
    in response to that detection [113]. These sensors are widely utilized in a variety
    of applications like as security systems, lighting control, home automation, and
    even wearable fitness gadgets to detect physical activity. Motion sensors come
    in a variety of forms, including passive infrared (PIR) sensors, which detect
    changes in heat signatures, ultrasonic sensors, which utilise sound waves to detect
    motion, and microwave sensors, which produce microwave signals and measure their
    reflection to detect movement [114], [115], [116]. 2.5.1. Accelerometers Accelerometers
    that track acceleration usually employ materials known as MEMS (Micro-Electra-Mechanical
    Systems) [117]. Accelerometers usually use piezoelectric components, such as single
    crystals of lithium niobate (LiNbO_3) for high-temperature applications or powerful
    permanent magnets for magnetic induction-based sensors. Each of these materials
    is appropriate for a specific range of temperatures and sensitivity requirements
    [118]. 2.5.2. Gyroscopes The Greek words \"skopein\" (to view) and \"gyros\" (circle
    or rotation) are the origin of the word \"gyroscope\" [119]. Depending on their
    intended use and performance specifications, various materials are used in sensors
    and gyroscopes. Other common choices include silicon for MEMS compatibility, quartz
    for high-precision applications, and piezoelectric materials like PZT that generate
    electrical charges in response to mechanical stress [120]. Quartz is well known
    for possessing piezoelectric properties, which can cause electrical impulses in
    response to mechanical stress or vibrations [121]. Moreover, polymers, metals,
    ceramics, and inertial materials are used; the selected material depends on the
    specifications of the specific sensor or gyroscope [122]. 2.6. Humidity sensors
    Hygrometry frequently measures both the temperature T and the relative humidity
    Rh. The definition of the rh, where Ps is the saturation pressure and Pw is the
    vapor pressure. The dew point Td (C), or the temperature at which the air must
    be cooled (while maintaining constant pressure), is a quantity that is commonly
    measured [123]. The oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of rGO
    and the dangling bonds at the edge sites of MoS were combined to sucessfully create
    2D rGO/2D hybrid composites (MS-GOs). To demonstrate their potential as promising
    materials for humidity sensors, these composites were subsequently drop-cast onto
    a substrate with Pt-interdigitated electrodes [124]. Sensitive materials play
    a critical role in determining a sensor''s performance, especially in humidity
    sensors, where they should exhibit strong adsorption characteristics compatible
    with the quartz crystal and silver electrode polarity; numerous materials, including
    polymers, metal oxides, and carbon-based materials, as well as nanomaterials like
    ZnO nanostructures, carbon nanotube/Nafion composites, and carbon nanomaterials,
    have been widely used, with nanostructures being particularly useful for detecting
    small changes [125]. The usage of a unique 2D Tungsten disulfide (WS2) material-coated
    optical side-polished fiber (WS2CSPF) as a highly sensitive and quick-response
    humidity sensor has been shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (521KB)

    (B). (C) WS2CSPF''s relative output optical power about relative humidity and
    SPF data [126]. 3. Sensing properties 3.1. Temperature sensing Temperature coefficient
    of resistance (TCR) measurements are frequently used to assess the sensitivity
    of resistive-type temperature sensors- where R, T, and R0 represent the temperature
    sensor''s starting resistance, total resistance change, and total resistance change,
    respectively [127]. The suggested sensor''s temperature sensitivity and range
    were 1.5005 nm/ °C and −25 °C ∼ 85 °C, respectively [128]. Table 2 presents a
    comparison table with the prior findings about the suggested sensor''s temperature
    sensitivity and range. Table 2 demonstrates that the suggested sensor''s temperature
    range is greater than that of other temperature sensors. Table 2. A table of comparison
    showing the temperature sensitivity and range of the suggested and prior sensors.
    Sensing Structure Temperature Range Temperature Sensitivities Refs. Sagnac interferometer

    12.5 nm/°C [132] 3.2. Pressure sensing For pressure detection, sensors with excellent
    linearity of response across a wide pressure range are necessary because they
    do not require pressure-response calibration, simplify data processing and circuit
    design, and speed up system response [133], [134], [135]. When situating the sensor
    above the display layers of a device, the linearity and sensitivity of the pressure
    sensor properties are critical factors to take into account. To reduce the need
    for sophisticated signal processing and to improve the device''s overall resolution
    and performance, high linearity must be attained. This assures a constant and
    linear connection between the collected signal and pressure [136]. When it comes
    to flexible piezoelectrics, PVDF is a well-known low-cost polymer material, although
    its piezoelectric capabilities are often inferior to those of PZT materials [137].
    The best method for identifying field-induced stresses in piezoelectric and electrostrictive
    ceramics relies on several variables, including the sample shape, displacement
    amplitude, and measurement frequency preferences [138] (Table 3). Table 3. Comparison
    of properties among various pressure sensors. Types Response Time Pressure Limit

    3.3. Humidity sensing Humidity sensors measure the moisture content in the air.
    The development of efficient humidity sensors focuses on improving several parameters,
    including obtaining a linear response, high sensitivity, quick reaction times,
    chemical and physical stability, a wide humidity detecting range, and affordability
    [147]. Fundamental characteristics of humidity sensors include hysteresis inaccuracy
    and dynamic response to changes in humidity [148]. According to the memory phenomenon
    known as hysteresis, the accuracy of humidity sensors has an offset that is reliant
    on the previous relative humidity and that offset fluctuates depending on the
    past RH. High-performance capacitive-based RH sensors may only detect humidity
    levels of 1 % RH. conventional hysteresis error [149]. The response time is defined
    as the time it takes the sensor to achieve 90 % of the final saturation current
    change in humidity air, whereas the recovery time is the time it takes the humidity
    sensor to return to 10 % of the current change above the initial current value
    in air [150]. Smart environmental management of buildings and infrastructures
    makes use of a broad variety of humidity sensors [151]. Fig. 5 illustrates key
    areas of use for humidity sensors. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    vary. 3.4. Gas sensing Gas sensor research has progressed over time, with a considerable
    move towards semiconductor combustible gas sensors. Despite their limited market
    share, gas sensors serve an important role in modern civilization, assuring safety,
    health, environmental preservation, and energy efficiency, as evidenced by the
    relevance of car oxygen sensors. Continuous developments in gas sensor technology
    are required to improve our society''s sustainability and general quality of life
    [152]. The relative resistance change determines sensitivity (S), as follows:
    Where is, Rg sensor resistance, Ra is the sensor resistance of airflow. The time
    required for 90 % of the total resistance to change after exposure to the target
    gas and air, respectively, is used to define response and recovery periods [153].
    The porous ZnO/3D-RGO network used in the CO sensor results in a sensor with exceptional
    sensitivity and quick response/recovery times. In addition, RGO works as an electron
    acceptor in the ZnO/RGO nanostructures, raising the breakdown of the layer of
    the coated ZnO nanoparticles and the consequent in higher sensitivity and faster
    response/recovery times compared to clean ZnO nanoparticles [154]. As shown in
    Fig. 6, this work divides gas sensing technologies into two [18] divisions to
    provide a clear introduction to sensing principles: approaches based on modification
    of electrical characteristics and other properties. Download : Download high-res

    classification. Furthermore, gas sensors that are intended for commercial use
    need to ensure that their functioning remains stable; that is, they need to provide
    a consistent and repeatable signal for an extended duration. As derived and inferred
    from [155] Several reasons are contributing to the instability of the gas sensor:
    (1) structural alterations, like differences in grain size or network; (2) mistakes
    in design (which should be avoided); (3) environmental variations Using materials
    with chemical and thermal stability; (4) chemical reaction-induced poisoning;
    and (5) phase shifts, which are generally related to the separation of additives
    doped with sensing materials; adjusting the elemental composition and grain size
    of sensing materials; and using particular technologies during surface pretreatment
    of sensors are some possible approaches to solving these issues. 3.5. Motion sensing
    The high mechanical quality factor (Q) is critical for sensitivity increase in
    conventional vibratory rate gyroscopes, however obtaining mode matching for high-Q
    gyroscopes sometimes requires a compromise between signal-to-noise ratio, linear
    input range, and measurement bandwidth [156,157]. In recent times, human hand
    motion (HHM) analysis has become a crucial area of study, particularly for manipulating
    dexterous robot hands that are trained on human hand abilities. It offers significant
    data on the motions, touch, velocity, and force of contact, all of which are recorded
    using various sensor technologies [158]. Several commonplace gadgets now have
    motion-detecting technology as standard equipment, which enhances automation,
    energy economy, and user experience. The particular application needs and the
    surrounding circumstances determine which sensor is best. 4. Sensing mechanism
    In multimodal sensors with decoupled sensing mechanisms, the choice of multifunctional
    materials and the design of the sensor structures are crucial. Recent advances
    in understanding the materials'' characteristics, effects of their structure,
    and sensing mechanisms for varied input signals are highlighted [159]. This section
    explores several sensing technologies, including resistive, capacitive, optical,
    and piezoelectric, illuminating how material characteristics affect the conversion
    of analyte-induced changes into quantifiable signals. To build efficient sensing
    devices, it is essential to understand the sensing principles behind the various
    types of sensors. Target analytes interact with various types of sensor materials
    and designs in unique ways, which results in the conversion of detectable signals
    from analyte-induced changes. Fig. 7 shows the sensing mechanism: Download : Download
    high-res image (577KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Sensing mechanism.
    4.1. Capacitive sensing mechanism The ability to adjust capacitance in response
    to outside stimuli characterizes capacitive sensors [160]. Typically sandwiched
    between upper and lower conductive electrodes, a parallel plate capacitor is a
    typical type of capacitive sensor. It is separated from the electrodes by an insulating
    dielectric layer [161], [162], [163], [164]. For capacitive sensors to provide
    excellent sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, linear range, SNR ratio,
    and stability, both the materials chosen and the structure design of electrodes
    and core layers are crucial [165]. A MUT''s interaction with the probing electric
    field forms the foundation of the capacitive sensing principle. To oppose the
    applied field, a MUT''s sensor electrodes generate an electric field that enters
    the device and generates electric displacement inside the device [166]. Capacitive
    sensors respond to solubility interactions (how much the analyte divides into
    the polymer) and the dielectric constants of the sensing polymer and the analyte
    [167]. The impedance of the electrodes can be roughly represented as a network
    of resistors and capacitors when nanogold film interdigital microelectrodes are
    submerged in solution, as conceptually depicted in Fig. 8. When nanogold film
    is exposed to a fluid, a structure known as an electrical double layer (EDL) develops
    on its surface. As a capacitor, EDL can also be modeled. Because the interfacial
    capacitance Cint changes as sodium nitrite molecules are adsorbed onto the nanogold
    film surface, it can be used to detect the deposition of sodium nitrite molecules
    on the nanogold film [168,169]. Download : Download high-res image (445KB) Download

    the sensed force may also be used to regulate how the clamp moves, creating a
    brand-new force sensing and feedback system. The developed revolutionary minimally
    invasive surgical force sensing device, which is based on a flexible triaxial
    force capacitive sensor, has created the groundwork for its application in minimally
    invasive surgery [171]. 4.2. Piezoelectric sensing mechanism A piezoelectric sensor
    is a transducer that uses materials that show the piezoelectric effect to transform
    mechanical stress or strain into electrical signals. Due to its affordability,
    small sensor size, and straightforward signal conditioning as compared to other
    high-temperature sensing techniques, piezoelectric sensing is becoming more and
    more popular for use in high-temperature applications in the aerospace, automotive,
    power industries, and material processing [172]. New sensing methods for SHM are
    becoming more and more popular. The commonly utilized piezoelectric techniques
    employ piezoelectric principles for both passive and active structural system
    monitoring [173]. At the top and bottom electrodes, respectively, a bend-up state
    (Fig. 9A) generates positive and negative charges. Positive (top) and negative
    (bottom) charges are produced by a bend-down situation (Fig. 9B). The reverse
    potential is created across the top and bottom electrodes when the sensor is removed
    from the bend-up or bend-down circumstances. Download : Download high-res image

    sensor, acting as a discerning apparatus, is skilled at identifying and measuring
    the physical intensity of incident light rays, effectively converting this optical
    data into an audible electrical signal that can be deciphered by either human
    operators or electronic instruments and devices. These sensors have been widely
    used across a variety of industrial sectors thanks to their adaptable characteristics,
    most notably in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, energy, aerospace,
    and a variety of other applications [175,176]. Optical sensors are becoming more
    common and are evolving swiftly. Optical sensors can be classified as SPR-based,
    SERS-based biosensors, fluorescence-based, structural color, etc. depending on
    how they sense things [177]. Label-free optical biosensors are tools that can
    quickly run an assay at the point of use that has high sensitivity and specificity
    to detect, measure, and monitor the presence of analytes of interest [178,179].
    Environmental monitoring, biochemistry, and medical diagnostics all frequently
    use optical sensors. 4.4. Electrochemical sensing mechanism Nanomaterials are
    appealing for sensing applications, particularly for electrochemical sensing,
    due to their distinctive features, which include outstanding electrochemical capabilities,
    high surface area, and variable electric conductivity [180]. By oxidizing or reducing
    the analyte at an electrode, an electrochemical biosensor determines the concentration
    of the desired analytes by a change in current, potential, conductance, or impedance
    [181]. In the past few decades, nanomaterials have proven to be suitable for biosensing
    applications due to their distinctive electrocatalytic capabilities, significant
    adsorption capacity, extremely small size, vast surface area, and ease of surface
    modification [182], [183], [184], [185], [186], [187], [188], [189], [190], [191],
    [192], [193], [194]. A typical sensor arrangement is shown in Fig. 10. Transduction
    electrodes can have various forms or geometries, such as indigitated or meander,
    which offer improved signals for capacitive and resistive sensing systems [195].

    Nanotechnology has been essential in the development of nanosensors that are affordable,
    portable, precise, and quick to identify. Nanosensors for the detection of explosives
    have significant potential, as demonstrated by advancements in the development
    of nanomaterials [197]. Environmental virus detection is a major application area
    for nanomaterial-based sensors (nanosensors), which rely on the distinctive optical,
    electrical, or magnetic capabilities of nanomaterials. When viruses interact with
    nanoparticles (or recognition agents on the nanomaterials), detectable signals
    can be produced that have a quick response time, high sensitivity, and high specificity
    [198]. Bioelectronics nanoengineering''s wearable health monitoring area has undergone
    a revolution thanks to nanomaterial-based sensors, leading to major improvements
    in continuous and personalized healthcare [199]. Antibodies, nucleic acids, infections,
    and metabolites are among the biological agents that a nano biosensor can find.
    The method involves attaching desirable bioanalytics to receptors, which modifies
    the physicochemical sign connected with the binding [200], [201], [202]. In Fig.

    are used in forensic analysis, biological testing, health monitoring, diagnostics,
    and the treatment of psychiatric problems. Biosensors can more quickly detect
    diseases and track patients'' conditions in addition to providing treatment and
    healthcare [204]. 4.6. Wireless sensing mechanism An important component of the
    communications industry is wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSN is utilized in
    a variety of contexts, including battlefield surveillance, patient medical monitoring,
    building automation, traffic control, environmental monitoring, and building incursion
    monitoring [205]. WSNs typically consist of a large number of inexpensive sensors
    with wireless communication and data processing capabilities. These sensors automatically
    gather environmental data in an organized fashion and forward it to sinks via
    one-hop or multi-hop routing [206], [207], [208]. In order to monitor an area
    of interest, a wireless sensor network is a collection of several sensor nodes
    spread across a region. Without the precise position of sensor nodes, the data
    in many WSN applications is worthless [209]. The sensor nodes (motes) are made
    up of the four parts shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download high-res image (217KB)

    [210]. For the development of effective, precise, and dependable sensing devices
    across a wide range of applications, it is essential to comprehend and utilize
    these distinct sensing processes. The selection of a sensing mechanism is based
    on the application''s specific needs, the type of analyte, and the desired level
    of sensitivity and selectivity. 5. Applications of sensor materials The development
    of small and better sensors is the result of ten years of research on metamaterial
    for sensing applications [211]. Since they can collect data and enable accurate
    analysis, sensor materials are used in a variety of industries. In Fig. 13 there
    are some particular uses that demonstrate the adaptability of sensor materials:

    gadgets for the Internet of Things are available in the consumer electronics (CE)
    market [212]. According to a recent study, from $10,221 million in 2009 to $22,190
    million in 2015, the global market for consumer electronics sensors would increase.
    The market is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 12.44
    percent between 2010 and 2015 as a result of the rising demand for sensors in
    goods including mobile phones, game consoles, and laptops [213]. A large portion
    of the industrialized world already has one or more of these gadgets, and prices
    typically range from $10 to $1000 depending on the device. According to ownership
    figures from 2013, the US has 80 % of DVD/Blu-Ray 359 players, 64 % of laptops,
    57 % of desktop computers, 45 % of cell phones, and 62 % of smartphones [214].
    Due to the use of often lethal, non-biodegradable, and non-biostable materials
    in the production of consumer electronics, a biological emergency of global proportions
    has been sounded [215]. In Fig. 14 the context of POC/PON assays and diagnostics,
    the vast library of nanoparticles currently available provides remarkable choice
    in terms of choosing materials that can maximize the analytical performance of
    assays with consumer electronic devices, opening up exciting opportunities for

    server allows for consumer electronics configuration. The sensors may record data
    on things like temperature, frequency, motion, sound, video, light, pressure,
    and more. On the basis of the inputs, training, and testing datasets are separated.
    Analyses of sensitivity are done as well as assessments of the impact of various
    inputs. The development and management of electronic devices can be handled by
    this model in a nonlinear way that takes into account fuzziness and complexity
    [217]. 5.2. Healthcare The healthcare sector has experienced substantial growth
    recently, and it has been a significant source of income and jobs [218]. These
    allotropes each have distinctive properties that make them particularly useful
    for a variety of biological applications, including cancer treatment, tissue engineering,
    drug delivery, medical diagnostics, bioimaging, and biosensing [219,220]. Depending
    on the sort of physiological signal that is recorded, wearable sensors used in
    homes and other regulated environments have varying degrees of dynamicity. The
    architecture for wearable sensing applications is being designed using a variety
    of sensor networks. When integrating with wearable sensors, certain of these networks''
    characteristics—such as price, configuration, and power consumption are taken
    into account [221]. A schematic design of several methods with embedded physical,
    chemical, and electrophysiological sensors is shown in Fig. 15 [222]. The use
    of radio-frequency identification tags (RFID), Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), Wi-Fi
    (IEEE 802.11), and ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocols has been taken into consideration

    For the delivery of medications as well as the detection of biochemical or electrophysiological
    signals, they can be injected through the skin or bodily orifices and applied

    To transmit data from wearable devices to the internet, connectivity such as body
    area networks (BAN), Bluetooth, WiFi, LTE, 3 G, 4 G, and 5 G may be utilized.
    It could be sent to a medical expert for therapeutic feedback or used by other
    network devices [224]. 5.3. Environmental monitoring Applications for environmental
    monitoring are crucial for gathering data on the state of the environment around
    us, including whether it is getting better, becoming worse, or staying the same.
    One of the main tools for environmental monitoring and, ultimately, environmental
    protection, is environmental sensors. Due to their distinctive dimensional features,
    micro/nanomaterials have been extensively investigated and used in environmental
    sensing in recent years [225]. In addition to producing enormous economic gains,
    rapid worldwide industrialization and urbanization have also caused resource depletion
    and serious environmental pollution issues, including air, soil, water, and energy
    (light, sound, heat, and radioactivity) pollution [226]. For the detection of
    inland water quality, hyperspectral remote sensing has been widely used. This
    technique retrieves the water quality parameters through a direct, high-resolution
    examination of the electromagnetic spectrum reflected from the water surface.
    This innovative method offers the chance to produce real-time data from water
    using a non-contact technique, greatly enhancing operational efficiency [227].
    One prominent example of the many crowdsensing nodes that can be used to estimate
    sources of air pollution and infer their potential impacts on human exposure is
    people using smart devices, vehicles frequently traveling along city streets,
    taxis, buses, and any transportation system at large. This allows for the mitigation
    and prevention of their harmful side effects [228,229]. The tremendous environmental
    problems that contemporary society is facing necessitate the development of cutting-edge
    technologies that can ensure a comprehensive and ongoing monitoring of the environment
    in all of its dimensions (air, land, and water). A new frontier of environmental
    monitoring, enabled by numerous low-cost devices and offering a denser and more
    accurate coverage of the territory, has emerged with the increasing availability
    of WSN, UAV, and crowdsensing technologies, today endorsed with significant sensing
    and processing capabilities [230]. 5.4. Defense and security Modern radar sensors
    for security and defense must function in a wide range of dynamically changing
    situations: Essential and difficult system requirements include the detection,
    tracking, and classification of very small and sluggish air targets, like drones
    in crowded regions, up to rapid air targets, like missiles and fighter aircraft,
    as well as an increasingly crowded and contested spectrum [231]. Recent years
    have seen the application of high-performance distributed fiber-optic sensors
    to both subterranean and outdoor intrusion detection systems. Fiber optic sensors
    have several well-known advantages over conventional technologies in intrusion
    detection systems, including their immunity to electromagnetic interference, high
    sensitivity, lack of field power requirements, inherent safety in dangerous environments,
    and high reliability and cost-effectiveness over considerable distances [232].
    5.5. Agriculture Chemical (bio)sensors for agricultural and food analyses have
    recently attracted more and more attention. Due to their beneficial characteristics,
    such as easy sample preparation, downsizing, portability, and decreased cost per
    analysis, chemical (bio)sensors have the potential to supplement or even replace
    traditional analytical procedures [233]. Organophosphate and carbamate residues
    from pesticides have been detected using enzyme biosensors based on the suppression
    of cholinesterase [234]. Through the quantitative measurement of variable oxygen
    consumption in the respiration (relative activity) of \"good microbes\" and \"bad
    microbes\" in the soil, nanosensors may be used to diagnose soil disease (produced
    by infecting soil microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi) [235].
    Biosensors have been proven to be highly helpful in identifying these stressful
    conditions using a variety of transducer approaches, including amperometric, electrochemical,
    and optical. The Ag-IoT''s representative agricultural sensor systems are shown
    in Table 4. Table 4. Typical agricultural sensors are used in different Ag-IoT
    applications. Classification Metrical Information Principle of Measurement Typical

    is demonstrated by their capacity to meet a range of requirements in different
    areas, improving safety, effectiveness, and data-driven decision-making across
    a number of industries. 6. Current challenges Sensors still face challenges concerning
    performance gaps and unreliability. Flexible sensors have been designed utilizing
    graphene-based conductive materials that have remarkable mechanical and electrical
    characteristics to overcome these problems [246]. In the age of digitization and
    big data, humans depend more and more on sensors to handle significant problems
    and enhance their quality of life. Flexible sensors are being developed to address
    the shortcomings of their typical rigid counterparts for ubiquitous sensing [247].
    However, to improve sensor technologies'' performance and dependability, several
    issues must be resolved. A few of the current issues with sensor materials and
    technology will be discussed in this overview. A calibration process is used to
    verify the accuracy and reproducibility of various measurement instruments, including
    sensors and measuring systems. Reliable, repeatable, and accurate measurement
    results depend on calibrated sensors. Effective quality assurance requires, among
    other things, calibration. A paradigm change in air regulatory agencies'' supplementary
    conventional air monitoring is generally recognized to have been brought about
    by low-cost sensors (LCSs). Large-scale uses of it have been severely limited
    because of concerns about data quality and performance stability. Environmental
    monitoring is a subject that greatly benefits from knowledge of the latest methods,
    developments, and difficulties associated with LCS calibration. This study''s
    summary of the available data demonstrates that rising demands are driving a sharp
    expansion in the worldwide sensor industry. Nonetheless, a small number of sensors
    have been the focus of the calibration efforts. Machine learning, regression,
    and relative humidity correction are the three most used methods of calibration
    [248]. Furthermore, to maintain uniformity across various sensor kinds and applications,
    standardized calibration processes and standards are required. When a gas other
    than the one being monitored or detected may influence the reading provided by
    an electrochemical sensor, this is known as cross-sensitivity. One problem limiting
    the development of hydrogen sensors is the cross-sensitivity of temperature, humidity,
    and other interfering elements to accomplish accurate hydrogen measurement in
    varied conditions. Many of the commercially available hydrogen sensors have a
    limited temperature range of operation, and the majority are limited to room temperature
    measurements. Additionally, high-temperature situations need greater precision
    and longer sensor lifetimes than those required at the temperature of the room.
    To enhance the effectiveness of the sensors, several novel materials sensitive
    to hydrogen were created [249]. In comparison to standard detection devices, the
    hydrogen sensor has the benefits of being compact in size, inexpensive, able to
    be measured online, and having a quick reaction time. It senses the quantity of
    hydrogen and produces a response signal [250], [251], [252], [253], [254], [255].
    Thus, the goal of designing regenerative life support technologies is now to build
    hydrogen sensors with high preciseness of detection, quick reaction times, extended
    calibration periods, and excellent stability [249]. For the design and use of
    communication sensors, energy consumption is one of the most restrictive constraints
    [256]. Regardless of whether they are powered by batteries or energy harvesters,
    power consumption is a key design factor for wireless sensor networks. Smart power-using
    gear is necessary for both strategies to succeed, albeit [257]. Real-world situations
    provide difficulties with energy management, such as battery replacement and recharging.
    The simultaneous communication attempt made across multiple sensor nodes during
    sensor network deployment causes network congestion. Since the network only provides
    a small quantity of information, low data yield is an issue in real-world settings
    [258]. Assuming normal operation, Fig. 17 continuous current (I = 2 mA) is based
    on an examination of power usage. The current I = 12 mA is used for data transmission.
    With a fair amount of energy use, the sensor can ensure a real-time data conveyance
    rate [259]. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 17. The power consumption analysis results are shown in the bar chart.
    In conclusion, despite recent major breakthroughs, calibration, cross-sensitivity,
    stability, interference, power consumption, downsizing, and data handling remain
    major difficulties for sensor technologies. Data specialists, engineers, and materials
    scientists must work together transdisciplinaryly to address these issues. To
    improve sensor performance and increase their robustness and reliability across
    a broad range of applications, creative solutions are essential. 7. Prospects
    of sensor materials Future sensors will have more sophisticated measurement systems
    and be more accurate. As process automation advances and sensing technology advances,
    more powerful and better-networked equipment for sensing is produced. This type
    of equipment is more successful and effective and helps to provide suitable decision-making
    possibilities. Sensors are becoming more widely used in a variety of applications
    leading to a linked society. Depending on the needs, this will be useful in a
    lot of situations in the future. Future sensors will measure with greater intelligence
    and accuracy [38]. Given their importance to so many different sectors and applications,
    sensor materials and technology have bright futures. Incorporating cutting-edge
    technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), advanced data analytics, and
    the Internet of Things (IoT) will enable sensors to become even more powerful
    and capable in the future. To investigate the physical mechanism underlying the
    well-preserved absorption behavior and improved sensing capability, we compute
    the intensity distributions of electric field and surface current at their respective
    resonances numerically [260]. At a meager 10.5 mW of power usage, the sensors
    exhibit sensitivity down to ppb-level VOC variations. A novel structure for the
    sensor is suggested to improve the low power consumption sensing response characteristics
    and baseline stability even more. SMO gas sensors can now be used in new applications
    thanks to the design''s innovative use of microheater geometry and fabrication
    techniques. Experimental characterization and modeling were used in this work
    to analyze two designs. A comparative report is provided [261] with the findings
    of the two sensors'' studies. The field of nanotechnology heavily relies on miniature
    sensors. Because of their unique characteristics, including enhanced electrochemical,
    photonic, and electromagnetic capabilities, size-affected nanomaterials are viable
    materials for sensing [262]. It is now possible to create smart systems that continuously
    monitor human activity thanks to advancements in sensing technology, embedded
    systems, wireless communication, nanotechnologies, and miniaturization. Many commercial
    developments are reported, and human activity monitoring is a thriving field of
    research. There will likely be a significant increase in the number of thin, powerful
    wearables that can track a variety of activities. Future gadgets will likewise
    address the issues with the present design. As physiological sensors become lighter,
    wearable technology that tracks a variety of human activities will become more
    comfortable. An official and informal survey projects that wearable technology
    will become more popular and used more frequently shortly. It also projects that
    the cost of the devices will decrease, making them widely useful in society [263].
    For any Internet of Things (IoT) device, sensors are one of the most important
    parts [264]. To guide chronic disease management and improve quality of life,
    advances in electronics, diagnostics, AI, algorithms, and healthcare are being
    applied to Internet of Things applications. There have already been some gains,
    and future developments that offer machine learning, data trending, and diagnostics
    at the individual level for longer-lasting guidance are anticipated as a result
    of the effort to take advantage of emerging technology. For upcoming innovative
    sensors and diagnostics, heterogeneous integration is being used in healthcare
    and IoT [265]. The combination of advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence,
    and the Internet of Things will propel a significant evolution in sensor materials
    and technologies in the upcoming years. Future smarter, increasingly interconnected,
    and environmentally friendly systems will be made possible by these advancements,
    which will produce sensing capabilities that are more precise, effective, and
    reliable across a range of industries. 8. Conclusion In summary, sensor materials
    have become essential in several industries such as transportation, medicine,
    agriculture, industrial operations, and environmental monitoring. However, these
    materials also encounter notable obstacles. The complexity involved in designing
    sensor materials for various applications is underscored by the demand for improved
    response speed, selectivity, and sensitivity, as well as the requirement for durability
    and environmentally favorable characteristics. The increasing scope of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) underscores the significance of tackling these difficulties, underscoring
    the need for materials capable of effortlessly connecting and interacting with
    information processing equipment in diverse operational contexts. Looking towards
    the future, the potential of sensor materials appears to be quite promising. Continuing
    research and innovation are anticipated to result in the development of materials
    that exhibit enhanced performance, heightened durability, and superior energy
    efficiency. The advancement of nanomaterials and intricate manufacturing techniques
    presents opportunities for the creation of sensors that possess exceptional selectivity
    and sensitivity, along with innovative functionality. These technological improvements
    are anticipated to not only address existing obstacles but also to facilitate
    the incorporation of sensor materials in future fields such as the Internet of
    Things (IoT). This integration will enable extensive data collecting, leading
    to improved automation and decision-making processes. This review underscores
    the significance of sensor materials by examining their recent advancements, applications,
    and research. It underscores the crucial role these materials play in molding
    our future and offers valuable insights for businesses and society as they navigate
    the dynamic realm of sensor technologies. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res

    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and

    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.

    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

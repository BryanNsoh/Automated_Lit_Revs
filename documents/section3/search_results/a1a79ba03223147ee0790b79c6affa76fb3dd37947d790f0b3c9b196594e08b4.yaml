    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,

    255 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology.

    System 1. Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor,
    aroma, and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany
    and Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical
    applications that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou
    et al., 2022), neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and
    potential benefits for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer
    prevention, menstrual health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016,
    Akhondzadeh et al., 2010, Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed
    to confirm its effectiveness and safety for specific medical conditions. It should
    be used in moderation and under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et
    al., 2011), but its cultivation is characterized by substantial manual labor,
    making it one of the world''s most expensive spices. This study addresses a significant
    research gap in the field, focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles
    et al., 2015) of saffron and the critical environmental factors that influence
    its development. The aim is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron
    production through IoT and addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation,
    which have been relatively understudied in existing literature. The two major
    analytical points are: 1. Optimizing Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding
    the specific environmental requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead
    to improved crop management practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and
    quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse
    cultivation provides more precise control over environmental factors such as light,
    temperature, and humidity, leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared
    to traditional open-field methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing
    research. The five major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering,
    leaf development, daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various
    factors, which have been deduced and summarized from different works as below
    1.1. Temperature Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud
    growth during the first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures,
    but flowering commenced shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005)
    found optimal floral development within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though
    exceeding 150 days resulted in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al.
    (2023) highlighted the crucial role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated
    that lowering the temperature to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions
    (23–27°C) was essential for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported
    by Wang et al. (2020), can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms
    to abort. Notably, their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers
    at all. Further research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal
    temperature fluctuations on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering
    followed by flower initiation in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached
    20°C. Conversely, prolonged hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn
    when temperatures dropped to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh
    et al. (2021) suggests that maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C
    and relative humidity of 65.71% for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient
    flower ontogenesis. However, for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019)
    found that 36 days of incubation at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective.
    Interestingly, both excessive and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting
    period have been linked to decreased saffron production and productivity, as noted
    by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally, chilling periods in December and January,
    with mean aerial temperatures around 2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful
    saffron flowering, according to the findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light
    intensity The role of light intensity in saffron cultivation remains somewhat
    enigmatic, particularly its impact on daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However,
    recent research by Chen et al. (2024) explored the effects of different light
    intensities and red/blue light combinations on saffron plants. Their findings
    suggest that a light intensity of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be
    optimal for maximizing stigma yield, quality, and nutrient content. On the other
    hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020) indicate that higher light intensities can
    compromise stigma yield and quality, despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis.
    Leveraging the wealth of knowledge obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based
    saffron system offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation
    by providing precise environmental control, data-driven insights, and adaptive
    management strategies. This integration of technology and scientific understanding
    holds great promise for advancing saffron production efficiency and sustainability
    in the future. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Technologies used The technologies
    that have been used in developing the prototype after considering all of the parameters
    are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller -The sensors used are the DHT11 and
    an LDR -Database management is handled using Google FireBase -The app environment
    was set up and developed using ReactJS Other technologies used by researchers
    in the same field have included Arduino UNOs which are generally more expensive
    than the ESP-32. They have also used separate air moisture and temperature while
    we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both these sensors as one and helps
    reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment. Each of them is explained in
    detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems on a-chip microcontrollers
    features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and is cost-efficient and less
    power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa LX7 dual-core The Tensilica
    Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor, or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor,
    which also has integrated antenna switches, power amplifiers, filters,low-noise
    receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management modules. ESP32 used is shown

    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. (Pinout for LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor).
    2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor consists
    of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit microprocessor which
    is used to output the temperature and humidity measurements as data which is serialized
    (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor The most common uses for photoresistors,
    also known as light-dependent resistors (LDR), are expected to discern the presence
    or absence of light or to gauge the power of the light. When the LDR sensor is
    exposed to light, the resistance reduces rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms,
    hinging on the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very elevated,
    often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential devices consisting of variable sensitivity
    depending on the wavelength of the input light. Although they are exploited in
    many applications, other gadgets like photodiodes and phototransistors frequently
    perform this light-sensing function. LDR Sensor used is shown in Fig. 3. Download

    (LDR Sensor). 2.1.4. Soil moisture sensor (under implementation) In our current
    prototype of the IoT-based saffron system, we are enhancing its suitability for
    outdoor cultivation conditions by incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition
    will enable real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter
    for optimizing saffron cultivation. By accurately assessing soil moisture content,
    our system can dynamically adjust irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron
    plants receive adequate hydration while preventing overwatering or drought stress.
    This proactive approach not only enhances plant health and productivity but also
    promotes water conservation and sustainability in saffron farming practices. With
    the integration of the soil moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers
    with a robust tool for efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation
    in outdoor settings. 2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored
    app development platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides
    tools to trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and
    create business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using
    Google Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting
    for up to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and
    Android app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with
    Firebase Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users
    and makes it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions.
    These features support email and password authentication, phone authentication,
    and access to Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete
    identity solution. Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free,
    cross-platform messaging app that allows businesses to send and receive messages
    on iOS, Android, and the web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL
    database, synchronization and storage of data between users can be done instantly
    between users. When the app is offline, it is still available because the device
    continues to connect to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash
    reporting tool called Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve
    security issues that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash
    analysis, developers can focus more on building features for their applications
    rather than managing and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance
    Monitoring Tools give developers information about the iOS and Android performance
    of their apps, allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing.
    When application performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android
    apps on multiple connected devices in a single operation. They can view results,
    including screenshots, logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS
    React is an open-source front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating
    user interfaces that are based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js
    or ReactJS. Meta (previously Facebook) and a group of independent programmers
    and businesses are responsible for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation
    for single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks
    like Next.js. React is only concerned with state management and presenting that
    information to the DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates
    the use of extra libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality.
    2.2. Application development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application
    is to display and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help
    to improve on-field work. The designing of the application is done such that it
    is easy for even a layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user
    experience is made by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white
    space and equal margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important
    for demonstrating the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward
    with our research, the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate
    the application''s performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness
    in practical on-field use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React
    JS, which is an open-source front-end JavaScript library used for developing user
    interfaces based on UI components. React can be exploited as a base in the development
    of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications The structure of the appis
    shown in Fig. 3 The application is synced with a real-time Firebase database,
    from which the app gets data simultaneously and displays it on its interface.
    Firebase web APIs (application programming interface) are used to communicate
    between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4 Download : Download high-res

    The same server is also responsible for storing data for research and academic
    purposes. Download : Download high-res image (65KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. (Javascript code for DB insertion). The app is integrated with the
    sensors that need to be installed in the field and collects live data that the
    user can access through the app, unlike the existing apps that only have static
    elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data and the data that have
    been collected, the app compares the live data with the optimal data and helps
    farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield. This app currently focuses
    on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help farmers predict which crops
    will be beneficial based on the live conditions of the soil and field. This way,
    production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3. Interface The application interface

    This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based saffron monitoring
    and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment is conducted
    in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped with sensors
    for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture, is installed.
    These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental parameters
    crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured to
    log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization algorithms
    to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions based on saffron
    cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized experimental layout
    with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive optimization recommendations
    generated by the IoT-based system, while control groups do not receive any intervention.
    Throughout a predetermined validation period, environmental parameters and saffron
    growth stages are monitored and recorded. Data analysis focuses on evaluating
    the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based system in providing monitoring
    and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results suggest that the IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively monitors environmental
    parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations. Treatment groups
    receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron growth and
    development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy in enhancing
    saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the advancement
    of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating sustainable
    production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to further refine
    the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities to optimize saffron
    cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future work In the next
    phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into our existing IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition aims to automate irrigation
    by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the saffron cultivation plot. Our
    experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable pump, installing it in the
    cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water based on soil moisture sensor
    readings. We will develop control algorithms to activate the pump when soil moisture
    falls below a predetermined threshold and integrate pump control functionalities
    into our IoT system. Through a series of experiments, we will validate the effectiveness
    of the integrated pump in promoting saffron growth and yield compared to manual
    irrigation methods. By automating irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to
    improve resource efficiency, enhance crop quality, and increase saffron productivity.
    5. Results and discussions This study posits the conceptualization and realization
    of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based application designed for the surveillance
    and regulation of pivotal agronomic parameters, encompassing variables such as
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, and luminance levels. The overarching
    objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges while concurrently augmenting the
    cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant application, characterized by
    its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors the capacity to bolster the
    qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops. A salient hallmark of this
    application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived data, thus serving
    as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers for investigative
    and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently adaptable,
    affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation to the
    cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its current
    purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful Luminous
    intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for the optimum
    range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The paramount aim
    of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural methodologies
    into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious economization
    of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community. A plausible
    extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies within a
    controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical
    current of . The maximum battery voltage during charging is , and the minimum

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are

    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator

    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance

    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT

    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and

    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is an important parameter
    in the plant photosynthesis process, which can relate to plant growth, crop water
    use, and leaf gas exchange. Previously, many researchers utilized commercially
    available sensors to monitor PAR. The high cost of the commercially available
    PAR sensors has limited researchers, agricultural professionals, and farmers to
    use and expand PAR monitoring in agricultural lands. Thus, this paper focuses
    on designing an affordable Internet of Things (IoT)-based PAR sensor monitoring
    system including 3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance
    evaluation of multiple light sensors, solar powering configuration, cloud setup,
    and cost analysis. Three sensors, including VTB8440BH photodiode, SI 1145, and
    LI-190R sensors, were evaluated. The 3D-printed waterproof enclosures were designed
    for the photodiode and SI 1145. Particle Boron was used for recording and sending
    the sensor data to the IoT webserver. Both the photodiode and SI 1145 were compared
    to LI-190R, which is the industry standard. In the calibration process, the R2
    values of the photodiode and SI 1145 with LI-190R were 0.609 and 0.961, respectively.
    Field validation data shows that SI 1145 had a strong correlation with LI-190R.
    In addition, the performance evaluation data shows the photodiode had a weaker
    correlation with LI-190R than SI 1145. In conclusion, the study successfully developed
    and designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring systems,
    including a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website. SI 1145
    with a glass filter is an alternative sensor to monitor PAR at a low cost and
    has the advantage of being connected to IoT microcontrollers.

    Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is an important parameter in the plant
    photosynthesis process, which can relate to plant growth, crop water use, and
    leaf gas exchange. Previously, many researchers utilized commercially available
    sensors to monitor PAR. The high cost of the commercially available PAR sensors
    has limited researchers, agricultural professionals, and farmers to use and expand
    PAR monitoring in agricultural lands. Thus, this paper focuses on designing an
    affordable Internet of Things (IoT)-based PAR sensor monitoring system including
    3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance evaluation of
    multiple light sensors, solar powering configuration, cloud setup, and cost analysis.
    Three sensors, including VTB8440BH photodiode, SI 1145, and LI-190R sensors, were
    evaluated. The 3D-printed waterproof enclosures were designed for the photodiode
    and SI 1145. Particle Boron was used for recording and sending the sensor data
    to the IoT webserver. Both the photodiode and SI 1145 were compared to LI-190R,
    which is the industry standard. In the calibration process, the R2 values of the
    photodiode and SI 1145 with LI-190R were 0.609 and 0.961, respectively. Field
    validation data shows that SI 1145 had a strong correlation with LI-190R. In addition,
    the performance evaluation data shows the photodiode had a weaker correlation
    with LI-190R than SI 1145. In conclusion, the study successfully developed and
    designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring systems, including
    a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website. SI 1145 with a glass
    filter is an alternative sensor to monitor PAR at a low cost and has the advantage
    of being connected to IoT microcontrollers. Keywords: Photosynthetically Active
    Radiation (PAR); IoT (Internet of Things); agriculture 1. Introduction Photosynthetically
    Active Radiation (PAR) describes the range of solar radiation that is used by
    organisms in the photosynthesis process. The wavelength of solar radiation in
    the PAR range is 400–700 nm. PAR measurement is important, as solar radiation
    is one of the main components determining plant photosynthesis. When leaf photosynthesis
    increases, PAR increases [1]. Standard commercially available PAR sensors include
    LI-190R (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) and Apogee SQ-500 (Apogee Instruments,
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA). In the past, PAR sensors have been used in various research,
    such as measuring the amount of light above and below the canopy of wheat [2];
    monitoring light in vertical farming for strawberry production [3]; measuring
    and controlling a lighting system for energy efficient crop production [4]; parameterizing
    evapotranspiration rates across a field of asparagus [5]; assessing the effects
    of full sun, medium light intensity, and vegetation shade on diverse species of
    plants [6]; and understanding the effect of PAR on the exchange of CO2, water,
    and energy between plants and their environment [7]. An example of using a PAR
    sensor is estimating the growth of soybeans. Soybeans, a known photosensitive
    crop, have been used to test PAR levels in accordance with simulated surface dimming,
    a way to decrease photosynthetically active radiation. A study within the Journal
    of Agrometeorology took three genomes of soybeans and tested their response to
    altered PAR levels via a custom shading net [8]. The study was done to find the
    best way to decrease PAR levels, which they tested using a Line quantum sensor
    (LI-191S, LICOR). Even though it has been stated that climate change will not
    have a major impact on PAR levels [9], it can be predicted that levels will change.
    These changes, however, are more impacted by local environmental factors, with
    its main parameter being water vapor pressure. Excessive gas emissions can also
    cause PAR levels to lower due to an increase in particulate matter in the atmosphere
    [9], thus absorbing more PAR prior to reaching the Earth’s surface. The cost of
    the standard PAR sensor is between 400–500 USD, and the datalogging system cost
    ranges from 500–2300 USD. This high cost of the commercial version of the PAR
    monitoring systems, including a PAR sensor and a datalogger, limits access for
    researchers, farmers, and agricultural professionals. This motivates the development
    of a low-cost version of a PAR monitoring system. The presentation of a low-cost,
    low-profile Photosynthetic Active Radiation sensor that was developed by Purdue
    University was first introduced at the ISCAS conference in Spain [10]. This sensor’s
    composition includes a silicon photodiode, a 400 to 700 nm optical filter, an
    optical diffuser, and a current-to-voltage conversion circuit. The translucent
    material of the diffuser disperses incoming light, which results in angle dependence.
    To amend this occurrence, the light diffuser uses a cosine corrector. There are
    various commercially available PAR quantum sensors, such as the LI-190R. While
    these sensors are very precise and well-calibrated, they are quite costly. Seated
    in the USD 300–400 price range, this does not include the corresponding meter
    required to display the output. Meanwhile, this newly developed low-cost PAR sensor
    has a total cost of half the amount: 111.83 USD.Light intensity is the factor
    contributing to the level of error displayed by this sensor. For the highest accuracy,
    light intensity must be at maximum intensity. Similar to the sensor developed
    by Purdue University, the GaAsP sensor has a sensor head and body that includes
    a photodiode and an acrylic diffuser that protects the photodiode. This provides
    cosine correction, like the sensor developed by Purdue University. Also, this
    sensor comprises an aluminum tube, a drainage hole, and an acrylic body located
    below the diffuser bonded via methylene chloride. For quick connection and disconnection
    for calibration and repair in a field setting, the sensor was designed with 40–50
    cm of multi-stranded communication wire. The GaAsP does have some sources of error,
    including spatial error, temperature dependence error, spectral response error,
    and signal drift error. Spatial error is the main source of errors, but it can
    be minimized if both the diffuser and photodiode are level with the outer rim
    of the sensor. Temperature dependence error occurs when temperatures reach levels
    above 15 °C, at a 3% margin. Previously, researchers developed an inexpensive
    datalogging system and connected it to a commercial version of a PAR sensor. For
    example, Barnard et al. (2014) utilized an Arduino microcontroller (Arduino, Turin,
    Italy) as a datalogger to read an LI-190 [11]. Harun et al. (2015) used an ATMEGA628
    microcontroller (Microchip, Chandler, AZ, USA) to read an LI-190 [12]. An inexpensive
    data logging system with a commercial version of a PAR sensor still costs around
    700 USD [11]. Other studies have developed a low-cost PAR sensor using a photodiode.
    For instance, the Vishay BPW34 photodiode (Vishay, Malvern, PA, USA) was used
    to measure PAR [13]. This design used a silicon photodiode, a diffuser, and an
    optical filter. This study found that the sensor measured PAR well at high light
    intensities, but had a larger error at lower light intensities. Pontailler (1990)
    also used a gallium arsenide photodiode to measure PAR [14]. This design did not
    use a filter, only the photodiode and a diffuser. The results show a good correlation
    with the LI-190 PAR sensor, but it overestimated by about 23% when measuring monochromatic
    light, which is in the wavelength range of 570–620 nm, one example of light that
    produces this wavelength range is sodium lamps. The University of England carried
    out a case study centered around triticale, where the methodology for measuring
    the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) using both
    active optical and linear irradiance sensors was described [15]. This measure
    of PAR is an important aspect of plant biomass production and plant growth modeling.
    The linear irradiance sensor newly created by Spectrum Technologies was studied
    and applied to agriculture through the crop triticale. The conclusion of this
    study emphasized the importance of sensor placement and solar illumination conditions.
    The linear quantum bar sensor was used to measure soil and canopy PAR (Rs and
    Rcs) but needed to be positioned at least 40 cm above the intended surface. It
    was explained that the linear quantum bar could achieve temporally stable readings
    within an elevation of 5° of solar noon. Also recommended was orienting the linear
    quantum sensor across rows to reduce measurement variance. There have also been
    methods to measure PAR using leaf area index measuring tools. Located in West
    Africa, a study focusing on millet crop and shrub fallow used this method for
    estimating the Intercepted PAR (IPAR). The Li-Coy LAI-2000 hemispherical radiation
    sensor is a sensor originally intended to estimate the canopy leaf area index.
    The LAI provides both canopy structure and angular information, allowing for a
    more efficient manner to measure these values compared to traditional methods.
    These methods allowed for a successful simulation of both instantaneous and daily
    IPAR. Results showed that a reasonable degree of accuracy can be achieved by using
    the LAI-2000. A noteworthy mention explains that both clear and cloudy days lead
    to increased errors [16]. Previous research shows an improvement in the design
    and development of a PAR sensor monitoring system is needed. As technology has
    developed, the IoT (Internet of Things) allows for connecting, monitoring, and
    controlling devices in real-time at a low cost [17]. Examples of many different
    applications for IoT have been implemented by growers in various countries for
    increased efficiency. Increased cost efficiency, energy efficiency, and work efficiency
    are all areas of benefit when utilizing the IoT in agriculture. Data transmission
    efficiency was studied in a review by Xu et al. (2022) on different methods for
    data transmission for the IoT in agriculture [18]. Various tradeoffs exist in
    terms of IoT data-sharing systems. These include Wi-Fi, LoRa, Bluetooth, and WAN
    wireless; these systems are readily available for implementation depending on
    the needs of the producer [18]. This exemplifies the customization that IoT has
    to offer the industry as well as academia to outfit a system to the exact specifications
    needed. An increase in customization and optimization undoubtedly increases the
    user experience as well as ensures that each system is only using what is needed
    for a given project. An example of this was the ZigBee WSN (wireless sensor network)
    optimized for medium-range usage within a large greenhouse space for humidity
    and fan monitoring using nodes [19]. This system utilized in the study demonstrates
    the basics of how an IoT network can store data and, furthermore, allows for it
    to be transported to the correct location. In addition to ZigBee, LoRa and Wi-Fi
    are also utilized to transfer the data and signals to drive actuators at a low
    cost [20]. Emerging communication technologies, including 5G and NB-IoT (narrow-band
    IoT), have started to be implemented in precision agriculture [21]. By 2026, the
    IoT market is expected to achieve an evaluation of USD 13 billion [22]. While
    the costs of the IoT for usage in precision farming may increase growers’ operating
    costs, the savings generated from time usage efficiency negate upfront costs.
    For example, in 2022, a system to monitor indoor environment data using IoT and
    open-source software was able to see a cost reduction from 230,000 USD to 5000
    USD for a 9290 m2 building using a traditional BAS (Building Assessment System),
    establishing a cost-effective, scalable, and portable IoT data infrastructure
    for indoor environment sensing named BDL (Building Data Lite) [23]. By creating
    a cost-effective system for IoT data measurement, the design team was able to
    save thousands of dollars on a monitoring system. The usage of open-source software
    should be noted also as this is becoming an increasingly popular method to drive
    down costs and increase system sharing [24]. IoT creations and optimizations are
    changing the operating landscape in which humans monitor the world. By creating
    systems that are more cost-effective, saleable, and connect more seamlessly, a
    natural trend of increasing profits will follow, barring no other unforeseen circumstances.
    As the cost of the IoT system decreases, the IoT technology has been utilized
    in many applications in agriculture, including plant disease prediction, frost
    protection, and irrigation scheduling [25,26]. This led to an increase in crop
    yields and quality [12,27,28]. The use of IoT technology in agriculture is expected
    to increase further as other previous studies have demonstrated its benefits in
    helping stakeholders make timely and informed decisions [29]. Over the years,
    many open-source photodiodes and light sensors have been developed. However, the
    evaluation and their potential use for PAR monitoring with a glass-cut filter
    have not been demonstrated. Moreover, making the PAR data more accessible through
    the IoT has not been well executed. Thus, the purpose of this paper focuses on
    the design and development of an affordable IoT-based PAR monitoring system, including
    3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance evaluation of
    each sensor, solar powering configuration, cloud setup, and cost. This affordable
    IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring system will make the PAR measurements more accessible
    to researchers, farmers, agricultural industries, and environmental scientists.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. PAR Sensors Three sensors were evaluated: an Excelitas
    Technologies VTB8440BH photodiode (Waltham, MA, USA); an Adafruit SI 1145 Digital
    UV Index, IR, and Visible Light Sensor (New York, NY, USA); and LI-190R PAR sensor
    (Lincoln, NE, USA). The LI-190R outputs millivolts but can be converted to μmol
    m−2 s−1 using Equation (1), which was referred to by LI-Cor Biosciences technical
    document. LI-190R has a spectral range of 400–700 nm. The VTB8440BH photodiode
    has a spectral range of 330–720 nm and a viewing angle of 100°. The SI 1145 has
    an IR and a visible light sensor; the IR sensor has a spectral range of 550–1000
    nm, and the visible light sensor has a spectral range of 400–800 nm. In this study,
    the visible light sensor of SI 1145 was used because it has a spectral range closer
    to that of PAR (400–700 nm). 𝑃𝐴𝑅= 𝑉 𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∗240.33 (1) where PAR is the PAR reading
    in μmol m−2 s−1, and Vout is the output from the LI-190R in mV. 2.2. Hardware
    Design For the photodiode and the LI-190R circuit, an Adafruit ADS 1115 analog-to-digital
    converter (New York, NY, USA) was used to read the sensor values in 16 bits, which
    allows for higher resolution measurement. A differential reading was used for
    each measurement, which takes a reading using two pins from each sensor. The circuit
    was controlled by a Particle Boron (San Francisco, CA, USA) microcontroller [30],
    and it has an embedded 4G LTE cell modem to send the data to the IoT cloud web
    server. I2C communication in Boron was utilized to connect it with ADS 1115 and
    SI 1145. Particle Boron 4G LTE was selected in this study due to the availability
    of the device, but any other microcontrollers with 4G or 5G technology can also
    be utilized for data logging. Both the photodiode and the SI 1145 are sensitive
    to light outside of the PAR spectral range. Thus, an optical UV AR IR glass-cut
    filter (Gzikai, Guangzhou, China) was used to filter out light outside of PAR
    spectral range. The optical glass-cut filter allows light between 415 nm and 655
    nm to pass through (Figure 1). The filter has a diameter of 6.5 mm and is 1 mm
    thick. The filters used in this design were 5 USD. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
    sheet (CGjiogujio, Nanjing, China) was used to diffuse the light entering the
    glass filter and sensor. The sheet is 2 mm thick, and a 7 mm circular section
    was cut using a cork borer. The PTFE sheet sits directly on top of the glass filter,
    and there is a 2 mm gap between the glass filter and the light sensor for both
    the photodiode and the SI 1145. A layout of the sensor, a glass filter, and a
    PTFE sheet is shown in Figure 2. Figure 1. Light penetration of the UV AR IR glass-cut
    filter. Figure 2. Diagram of the layout of the PTFE sheet and glass filter for
    the photodiode and SI1145. An enclosure was designed and 3D-printed for the photodiode
    and the SI 1145. The design was made using Thinkercad (Autodesk Inc., San Francisco,
    CA, USA) software and printed with the MakerBot Replicator 2 3D printer (New York,
    NY, USA). The enclosure consists of two pieces: one piece allows for the glass
    filter and PTFE sheet to be set in place and has a cut-out for either the photodiode
    or the SI 1145. The other piece is a plate that attaches four bolts and nuts.
    The pieces were printed using polylactic acid (PLA). The groove of the enclosure
    allows the use of a cable tie to mount the enclosure to a pipe or a post. The
    enclosure was made waterproof by using a clear silicone caulk at each of the openings.
    The drawing for the enclosure is shown in Figure 3 and printed enclosure is shown
    in Figure 4. Figure 3. Enclosure design. (A): Outside of the enclosure. (B): Bottom
    plate of the enclosure. (C): Inside of the enclosure for the photodiode. (D):
    Inside of the enclosure for SI 1145. (E): Cross-section of enclosure for the photodiode.

    for SI 1145 and photodiode. To use the PAR sensor monitoring system (Particle
    Boron and PAR sensor) in outdoor conditions, a lead–acid 12 V 7 Ah battery, a
    solar charge controller, and a 12 V 20 W solar panel were used to power the devices.
    An IP67 waterproof enclosure (290 × 190 × 140 mm) was used to house Boron, solar
    charge controller, and a lead–acid 12 V 7 Ah battery. Overall diagram of the affordable
    PAR sensor monitoring system is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. System diagram of
    the IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring system. 2.3. IoT and Program Design The three
    sensors were connected to Particle Boron to measure, record, and send the values
    to Ubidots IoT webserver [31]. Sensor data is stored on Ubidots as raw variables.
    Synthetic variable function on Ubidots allows users to enter equations to solve
    mathematical problems on the cloud. The instructions of functions are provided
    on Ubidots manual. This synthetic variable function was used to enter each developed
    calibration equation for photodiode and SI 1145 in Ubidots to calculate the estimated
    radiation values. Ubidots allow storing the data for up to 2 years. The dashboard
    on the website allows user to display the data in an easy-to-understand and effective
    way (Figure 6). The data is updated every 10 min and allows real-time data monitoring.
    The 10 min time interval was chosen to minimize battery loss. When the sensors
    were not reading, the 4G modem module was deactivated. The flow of the microcontroller
    programming is shown in Figure 7. In the program, the Boron only connects with
    the cell tower when it sends the value to Ubidots. This allows for saving data
    usage and battery. For each sensor, 100 samples were taken with a 100-millisecond
    delay from each measurement, and then the average was recorded. Figure 6. Screenshot
    of the IoT web server that displays data and shares with users. Figure 7. Flow
    of the microcontroller program. 2.4. Sensor Calibration The sensors were compared
    using a full-spectrum light-intensity controllable 1000 W LED grow light (Viparspectra,
    Richmond, CA, USA). This experiment was conducted in a controlled environment.
    The three sensors were all placed 12.5 cm from the light and were taking readings
    simultaneously. The intensity of the light was increased at different intervals
    ranging from off to maximum intensity. The reading from each of the sensors was
    recorded at each of these intervals and compared. 2.5. Sensor Evaluation in Outdoor
    Environments Three sensors, LI-190R, photodiode, and SI 1145, were installed outside
    at Michigan State University Campus, East Lansing, MI, USA. The sensors were at
    a height of 203 cm and mounted on a 5.08 cm diameter PVC pipe with a cable tie.
    There were no obstructions affecting the path from sunlight to each sensor. A
    12 V 20 W solar panel and a solar charge controller were used to charge a lead–acid
    12 V 7 Ah battery. Particle boron was powered through the micro-USB port. Each
    sensor data was collected every 10 min and sent to the Ubidots webserver. 2.6.
    Statistical Analysis To evaluate the performance of the proposed affordable PAR
    sensor designs, the measurements were compared against the LI-190R PAR sensor.
    Statistical analysis was performed using root mean squared error (RMSE), index
    of agreement (IA), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2),
    and used Microsoft Excel for calculation. RMSE measures the difference between
    the measured and predicted value and is defined in Equation (2), IA is defined
    in Equation (3), and MBE is defined in Equation (4). RMSE= 1 N ∑ N i=1 ( M i −
    P i ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (2) IA=1− ∑ N i=1 ( M i − P i ) 2 ∑

    3.1. Sensor Calibration Figure 8 shows the comparison of the photodiode’s output
    and LI-190R. The relationship was exponential and the R2 was 0.609. Figure 9 shows
    the comparison of the SI 1145′s output and LI-190R. The relationship was fitted
    with 2nd order polynomial, and the R2 was 0.961. This result shows a strong correlation
    between LI-190R and SI 1145. This correlation for the SI 1145 is comparable to
    that of Rocha et al. (2021), who obtained R2 values of 0.962 and 0.958 when compared
    to solar radiation for two prototypes of the PAR sensor using a photodiode [13].
    Fielder et al. (2000) achieved an R2 value of 0.999 when comparing their photodiode
    to a LI-190 quantum sensor [32]. Figure 8. Comparison of photodiode with LI-190R
    from the calibration process. Figure 9. Comparison of SI 1145 with LI-190R from
    the calibration process. 3.2. Sensor Evaluation in Outdoor Environments Figure
    10 shows the comparison of LI-190R, SI 1145, and photodiode data in the outdoor
    environment. Table 1 shows the results of the statistical analysis for comparing
    the SI 1145 and the photodiode measurements to the LI-190R values. The statistical
    analysis indicates that SI 1145 was overestimated by 3.564 μmol  m −2  s −1 based
    on MBE. These errors are relatively small compared to the range measured throughout
    the day, which can be from zero to up to 1700 μmol  m −2  s −1 . The photodiode
    had an underestimate for MBE of −31.399 μmol  m −2  s −1 . The SI 1145 had a much
    higher IA value (0.989) than the photodiode (0.834). The IA of the SI1145 is comparable
    to that of a study conducted by Rocha et al. (2021), which obtained an IA of 0.953
    and 0.950 for the two prototypes of PAR sensors using photodiodes [13]. Figure

    Table 1. Statistical analysis results. 3.3. Cost The goal of this design is to
    be less expensive than a PAR sensor monitoring system currently available on the
    market. The components used in the design are low-cost and easily obtainable,
    making the overall design easy to replicate. Table 2 lists each component necessary
    to replicate the system for the SI 1145, photodiode, and LI-190R, respectively.
    The cost to build a PAR sensor monitoring system with SI 1145 and the photodiode
    is 202 and 207 USD, respectively. This is less expensive than using a microcontroller
    to read a commercial PAR sensor like the LI-190R. For example, the design outlined
    by Barnard et al. (2014), using an Arduino microcontroller with an LI-190 sensor,
    costs 685 USD [11]. Table 2. Material Cost for Power, LI-190R, SI 1145, and Photodiode
    System. The cost is comparable to other studies using a microcontroller and a
    photodiode to measure PAR. The cost of a system utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller
    is estimated at 200 USD [13]. The advantage of the design outlined in this paper
    is the ability to deploy the sensor anywhere as it uses a 4G LTE cell tower instead
    of Wi-Fi that ESP8266 uses. A cellular module can be added to the ESP8266 to utilize
    3G or 4G technologies, but the total costs, usability, and complexity of the additional
    module are not justified compared to the proposed system. 4. Conclusions The study
    successfully compared both the photodiode (VTB8440BH) and SI 1145 with LI-190R.
    The performance of SI 1145 had a strong correlation (R2 = 0.961) with LI-190R.
    However, the photodiode had a weaker correlation with LI-190R (R2 = 0.609). This
    study successfully designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring
    systems, including a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website.
    The cost of building the SI 1145 was about 20% of the cost of building a monitoring
    system using the LI-190R sensor. Considering a similar performance between SI
    1145 and LI-190R (IA = 0.989, MBE = 3.564), an SI 1145 with an optical UV AR IR
    glass-cut filter would be the alternative way to monitor PAR. Because of this
    affordable PAR sensor, researchers, farmers, agricultural industries, foresters,
    and environmental scientists may use more PAR sensors for plant/tree growth prediction,
    water uptake estimation, irrigation management, etc. Recent studies show that
    PAR measurement has been utilized in indoor farming [33] and irrigation scheduling
    [34]. Soybeans are known as photosensitive crops; the accurate prediction of the
    growth stages of a soybean will enable precision irrigation scheduling, which
    will improve crop production and irrigation water use efficiency. Incorporation
    of PAR data with other field monitoring data, such as soil moisture monitoring
    [27] and SAP flow [35], for irrigation scheduling is recommended for future study.
    More applications of the developed affordable IoT-based PAR sensor in other agricultural
    systems, such as animal production, aquaculture, and high tunnel, should also
    be explored. Further studies assessing different photodiodes to monitor their
    capability to measure PAR should be performed and compared to this proposed design.

  description: Urban farming has gained popularity in recent years, as more people
    have become interested in locally grown food and reducing their carbon footprint.
    Smart hydroponic systems can be an important tool for urban farming as they allow
    for precise control over plant growth and require less space and resources than
    traditional farming methods. Urban areas often lack access to land suitable for
    farming, making hydroponic systems a viable option for growing crops in limited
    space. Readily available hydroponic systems in the market are costly and not cost
    effective, thus hydroponic systems are usually only installed in larger scale
    farming. The challenge here is to connect multiple low-cost sensors to microcontrollers
    and to any store-bought hydroponic set. This paper describes the development of
    smart Internet of Things (IoT) hydroponic system integrated with an Android mobile
    application for small scale urban farming. The new set up of IoT hydroponic set,
    coined as SMART GROW, is used to monitor and control various aspects of the system
    based on the basic parameters important in growing a healthy plant. The challenges
    faced during this build were irregular reading of the analog sensor when connected
    to a single board microcontroller (ESP32). This issue was resolved. SMART GROW
    currently is capable of monitoring basic parameters such as pH, EC and water level
    and can cater to additional sensors for monitoring other parameters if required.
    SMART GROW can easily be replicated and built at home and customized to the needs
    of the plant's requirement. SMART GROW is versatile as it can be used to grow
    a wide variety of plants, including herbs, vegetables, and fruits, and offers
    several benefits over traditional soil-based growing methods such as automated
    regulation of the water level.

    Hardware in context Urban agriculture is a growing trend that includes various
    techniques such as vertical farming, indoor farming, hydroponics, aeroponics,
    aquaculture, and aquaponics [1]. Hydroponics is a form of vertical farming that
    grows plants in nutrient solutions instead of soil [2]. It can be done with or
    without the use of smart technology. Smart hydroponic systems are designed to
    improve water use efficiency by applying a combination of hydroponic systems with
    drip irrigation [3]. Recent studies have shown that integrating wireless sensor
    networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) into hydroponic systems can assist in
    optimal plant growth [1]. The architectural design of smart hydroponics systems
    has evolved over the past ten years or more [4], [5], from purely hardware components
    [6], [7] to designs that include server and client services [5], [8], [9]. The
    ability of smart hydroponics has evolved from monitoring only to providing corrective
    ability to maintain equilibrium required by the hydroponics system [10], [11],
    [12]. Smart hydroponics systems commonly consist of the following components:
    1. Hydroponics hardware that provides a planting platform, 2. Data acquisition
    hardware to capture parameters of the hydroponic solution, 3. Server processing
    that analyses data captured by the data acquisition, and 4. Client services that
    provide different choices of services at the user end. Remote monitoring and automatic
    regulation of hydroponic systems have been achieved with systems consisting of
    a network of devices allowing the value of sensors to be remotely monitored and
    controlled in real-time. These systems feature the ability to self-regulate with
    minimal user intervention. For example, [7] developed an auto-calibrated pH sensor
    capable of detecting and correcting out-of-range pH readings through an attached
    irrigation system. However, users could not remotely identify the pH reading in
    real-time. The choice of hydroponics hardware depends on regional needs, with
    most literature choosing nutrient film techniques as less water is required [4].
    Sensors deployed in the data acquisition system mostly focus on the water level
    and pH reading of the system [13]. More recent designs have deployed more sensors
    to detect other parameters such as EC reading and temperature of water [9]. The
    processor connecting directly to the sensors at the hardware level has shifted
    from Arduino UNO [8] to Arduino MEGA boards [14], and later to custom-made PCB
    boards or ESP32 boards [9], [15] that have higher clock speeds and WiFi features
    in their circuitry. For data transfer protocols, WiFi and LoRaWAN are more commonly
    chosen [5]. The server processing has Thingspeak as the most frequently found
    service deployed by the literatures. These literatures do not provide client service
    in the form of a mobile application interface because their main purpose is to
    minimize user manual intervention. The client service is normally in the form
    of notification and does not receive input from the user [5], [13]. Notifications
    are only sent to the user when critical situations occur, such as when water levels
    are lower than normal [5]. [8] uses Firebase, which allows connection to a client’s
    mobile application, but it did not report any GUI. However, there are situations
    where user input is required. Our study proposes a system that allows customizing
    parameters of system to suit different plants, which is not addressed in most
    literatures. Although [14] reported trials for different vegetables planted in
    their system, they did not explain in detail how the changes to parameters were
    made. In addition, the system proposed by [14] costs around 400 USD, which is
    relatively high. According to [16], the cost of a small, uncomplicated hydroponic
    system typically ranges from USD 50 to USD 500. Medium systems cost at least several
    hundred dollars, while large systems can cost several thousand dollars or more.
    In developing countries like Malaysia, a ready-to-use 4-tier waterfall home garden
    costs RM 599 (USD 130) [17], while a DIY hydroponic set with a timer costs RM
    229 (USD 50) [18], both without IoT. A ready-to-use 32-pot full-spectrum system
    including a timer, pH meter, and digital timer but without mobile app IoT control
    costs RM 1099 (USD 240) [19]. SMART GROW outperforms these systems at a lower
    cost, making it more affordable and customizable for developing countries. While
    there are existing works on automated hydroponic systems [10], [11], [12], no
    specific steps or costs are given. Four commercial automated smart hydroponic
    systems were reviewed for their cost, features, graphical user interface design,
    and pros and cons. Additionally, the tools and techniques used to develop the
    prototype were examined for their suitability for this project. Table 1 summarizes
    the comparisons made. Table 1. Comparison of features to Existing Commercial Systems.

    Systems. Espressif ESP32 development board The ESP32 is a microcontroller that
    can readily connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi. The SMART GROW system utilizes
    two DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 boards. One board is used to capture and upload data
    from the EC probe. The second board is used to capture and upload data from the
    pH probe and ultrasonic sensors, fetch data from the database, including ECValue,
    and control micro water pumps 1, 2, and 3. PH4502C pH sensor The pH sensor is
    connected to one of the ESP32 boards. However, the pH sensor outputs an analog
    signal ranging from 0 to 5 V, while the ESP32 can only receive voltage inputs
    of 3.3 V or below, creating an incompatibility. This issue was resolved by using
    two 1000 Ohm resistors to lower the voltage to below 3.3 V before it reaches the
    ESP32. The output was calibrated through calculations using polynomial regression
    at different points. The regression equation was proposed by an engineer through
    empirical processes and integrated into the SMART GROW Arduino codes. User can
    directly use the code without further calibration. The pH sensor serves as a pH
    level detector, with codes written to continuously fetch data from the sensor
    and send it to the Firebase database via the ESP32. DFR0300 EC sensor The EC sensor
    is connected to a different ESP32 board than the pH sensor. Similar to the pH
    sensor, the EC sensor outputs an analog signal greater than 3.3 V, while the ESP32
    can only receive voltage inputs of 3.3 V or below, creating an incompatibility.
    This issue was resolved by using a single 1000 Ohm resistor to lower the maximum
    output of the EC sensor. The output was calibrated through the same calculations
    that uses polynomial regression at different points which was proposed by an engineer.
    The EC sensor must be connected to a separate ESP32 board to avoid electrical
    interference with the pH sensor and achieve stable readings. DS18B20 temperature
    sensor The temperature sensor is connected to the same ESP32 board as the EC sensor.
    This is necessary because the temperature of the hydroponic solution is required
    for the computation of the EC value, which is integrated into the SMART GROW Arduino
    codes. Users can directly use the code without further configuration. The waterproof
    temperature sensor is placed in the hydroponic solution to measure its temperature.
    JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor Three ultrasonic sensors are utilized in this project,
    each serving a distinct function. The first sensor measures the height of the
    water level in the hydroponic reservoir, the second sensor measures the height
    of clean water in the water reservoir, and the third sensor measures the height
    of the nutrient solution in the nutrient reservoir. All readings are calculated
    and converted into percentages to facilitate user understanding. Micro water pump
    Four micro water pumps are utilized in this project, each serving a distinct function.
    The first pump is responsible for pumping clean water into the hydroponic reservoir
    if the pH or EC value exceeds the user-defined threshold. The second pump adds
    nutrient solution to the hydroponic tank when the pH or EC value falls below the
    user-defined threshold. The third pump removes excess water from the hydroponic
    reservoir, while the fourth pump circulates nutrient-enriched water through the
    hydroponic tiers. Software overview The Arduino Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE) is an open-source software that allows users to write, compile, and upload
    code to development boards. It is available for free on multiple platforms, including
    Windows, macOS, and Linux. The IDE is designed to be user-friendly and accessible
    to beginners while also being powerful enough for experienced programmers. It
    includes a code editor, compiler, debugger, and serial monitor for communicating
    with the board and monitoring its output. One advantage of using the Arduino IDE
    when programming ESP32 microcontrollers is its compatibility with the ESP32-Arduino
    Core software. This software bridges the hardware gap between the ESP32 and the
    Arduino, allowing users to use the Arduino IDE as their development environment
    and program the ESP32 using a language similar to that used for the Arduino. Additionally,
    many Arduino libraries can be reused when writing software for the ESP32. Users
    can write code in C++ using the Arduino IDE and upload it to development boards.
    The IDE includes a large library of pre-written code and examples that can be
    used to learn how to program different types of development boards. For instance,
    SMART GROW was coded using C Programming Language as Arduino IDE supports both
    C and C++. Design files summary All packages and files can be downloaded from

    GROW is hydroponics with IoT (Internet of Things) which will enhance the efficiency
    and productivity of hydroponic systems. Hydroponics itself is a method of growing
    plants without soil, where the plants are instead grown in a nutrient-rich water
    solution. The illustration below shows the entire SMART GROW set up which consists
    of the DIY 6 holes hydroponic set, sensors linked to the ESP32 boards, firebase

    DIY SMART GROW hydroponic set The hydroponic set was customized and built from
    scratch to minimize cost. Fig. 3 is the blueprint of SMART GROW DIY Hydroponic
    set. The maximum capacity of SMART GROW is 10 L. The inner dimensions of the tray
    were 38 cm (L) × 28 cm (W) × 10 cm (H), which would give a volume equal to 10,640
    cm3. The container was filed with a 10 L of water and the water needed to reach
    a certain height depending on the container dimension, which was calculated using
    the equation below: Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    Hydroponic Set Up. Instructions for programming the ESP32 board First, the user
    must download and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    Then, they must install the ESP32 library by choosing version 1.0.6. A step-by-step
    guide can be viewed in the following video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBaS3YnqDaU.
    After that, the user must download the SMART GROW scripts and libraries from the
    link provided in this article (see Section 3). The SMART GROW libraries must then
    be downloaded and stored at the path for the Arduino IDE library (for example,
    on a desktop with Windows OS, the path would be …\\Arduino\\libraries). Next,
    the user must connect the ESP32 to a computer using a USB cable and open the Arduino
    IDE on the computer. The script should then be verified and uploaded to the ESP32.
    Note that there are two ESP32 boards deployed in the system. User must upload
    one of the codes to one of the ESP32s while uploading the other code to the other
    ESP32. Instructions for setting up a firebase real-time database Download the
    SMART GROW database diagram (See Section 3). Create a Google Firebase Real-Time
    database account and create tables in it according to the database diagram. Instructions
    for installing the SMART GROW mobile application First, user must download the
    APK file (see Section 3) to their devices. Before installing it, user must ensure
    that their devices are set up to allow the installation of apps from unknown sources.
    To do this, navigate to the device’s Settings, then to Security, and enable the
    “Unknown sources” option. Once the APK file has been downloaded and the “Unknown
    sources” option has been enabled, user can navigate to the folder where it is
    saved using a file manager app. Tap on it to start the installation process. User
    will be prompted to review the app’s permissions and then asked to confirm that
    they want to install it. After confirming, it will be installed on their devices
    and can be found in their app drawer or on their home screen, depending on their
    device. Operating instructions for SMART GROW Android mobile app From the SMART
    GROW Android mobile app’s homepage, current readings of the hydroponic set are

    ESP32 A4 captures data from the pH probe and ultrasonic sensors and sends it to
    the database. It also controls all the micro water pumps and is responsible for
    streaming data from the database and updating the variables minrpH, maxrpH, minrEC,
    maxrEC, minrTank, and maxrTank locally. This only occurs when the Firebase library
    detects changes in data in the database. When environmentRegulation() is called,
    the state of three pumps - pumpW, pumpN, and pumpT - is either turned on or off
    based on the latest ECValue, pHValue and air level in the reservoir. PumpW supplies
    additional water to the hydroponics if it lacks water; pumpN supplies additional
    nutrients to the system if it lacks nutrients; and pumpT supplies additional water
    to the water container containing pumpW if its water level becomes too low to
    support the system. On the other hand, ESP32 A3 only captures data from the EC
    probe and sends it to the database regularly over time. Validation and characterization
    The proof-of-concept is when the hydroponic set, IoT and the app must work together
    and ensure that the requirements of the users are achieved. The proof-of-concept
    for SMART GROW focuses on integration testing, functional testing, and user testing
    of the proposed system. There are two parts to the integration testing. The first
    part tests the operability of the low-cost sensors integrated on a single microcontroller.
    The second part was the integration testing, where all the sensors in the SMART
    GROW must be able to relay accurate data to the app developed. Each of the data
    is explained in the separate sub section 7.1. This was then followed by functional
    testing which was to ensure that the developed app is in accordance with the functions
    required by the user. Sub section 7.2 will explain the results further. Integration
    and functional testing are insufficient without the user utilizing and growing
    with the proposed system. Testing was conducted with user growing vegetables using
    the SMART GROW hydroponic system and the test results are explained in sub section
    7.3 and 7.4. Integration testing EC sensor, ultrasonic sensors and ESP32 were
    integrated and tested for the purpose of measuring electrical conductivity and
    water level. The first test carried out was not successful due to the placement
    of the EC sensor and the ultrasonic sensors on the same ESP32. The solution to
    this is to separate the EC sensor and ultrasonic sensors on two different ESP32
    with two different circuits which when tested, showed accurate readings. This
    was an important setup in SMART GROW. The pH and ultrasonic sensors were integrated
    with the ESP32 and tested for their ability to measure pH, nutrient, and solution
    levels in the tower. Preliminary tests were unsuccessful due to the placement
    of the sensors. The ultrasonic sensors require a clearance of 35 cm from the solution
    surface to accurately read the solution level. To resolve this issue, the pH sensors
    were placed further away, and the ultrasonic sensors were placed on top of the
    tower. Additionally, the pH and ultrasonic sensors were connected to different
    GND pins on the ESP32 to avoid ground loops, which can cause interference from
    currents generated by the sensors. With these adjustments, the pH readings fluctuated
    within an acceptable error margin, and the ultrasonic sensors were able to accurately
    read the water level. The sensors and ESP32 are integrated as part of the SMART
    GROW and the purpose of the following integration testing was to assess the communication
    between the SMART GROW and the app. For this testing, the settings were changed
    in the SMART GROW app, when manually evaluated, these settings were applied to
    the SMART GROW box: providing a pass to this integration testing. Functional testing
    In order to perform basic hydroponic plant monitoring, nine functions were requested
    and listed in table below (Table 4). Functional testing was performed based on
    each of these functions. All of the functions passed the functional testing because
    the functions was developed in accordance to the requirement listed by users.

    Library User testing A user test was conducted to evaluate the proposed SMART
    GROW system. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [17], a theory that models
    how users accept and use technology, was applied to the user testing of the hydroponic
    system. Two main aspects were considered: • Perceived usefulness or how users
    find the system useful for a specific task. • Perceived ease-of-use or how easily
    users can handle the system with minimal guidance. The following factors were
    considered during user testing: • Learn ability and intuitiveness. • Error prevention
    and error handling • Visibility and documentation • Discoverability and exploration
    • Consistency • Interactivity Users were provided with the SMART GROW system,
    including both the physical setup and the app, as well as a user testing form
    with the above factors listed for rating. Based on the user testing results, three
    factors - learnability and intuitiveness, error prevention and error handling,
    and consistency - passed. However, visibility and documentation, discoverability
    and exploration, and interactivity were rated as minor failures. For visibility
    and documentation, users initially found it difficult to update or delete available
    plant data. However, this issue was quickly resolved through exploration of the
    available options. Although users rated discoverability and exploration as a minor
    failure, they did not test all of the functions available in the SMART GROW app
    within the given time frame. Nevertheless, they were able to view the main features.
    This issue was addressed by allowing users more time for exploration. For interactivity,
    developers expected that users would use the app occasionally throughout the day,
    compared to current practice of manually checking the hydroponic set only when
    remembered. In the user testing form, users were asked if they used the app occasionally;
    they reported using it once or twice per day, which was better than expected.
    Overall, users were satisfied with the proposed system. User planting Users were
    provided with SMART GROW hydroponic set and the mobile app. Hydroponic Nutrient
    AB was used in growing solution. Hydroponic Nutrients AB is a water soluble granular
    (SET A) and water-soluble powder (SET B) plant food containing N, Ca & Fe. It
    is a complete balanced fertilizer for hydroponics, indoor/outdoor potted plants,
    vegetables, and herbs. The plant species planted was Brassica juncea (L.) Czern
    var. Ensabi is a new local variety of mustard species, found only in Sabah and
    Sarawak, Malaysia. Users also cultivated Ensabi in conventional soil medium for
    observation. Users observed and documented the growth of Ensabi. Based on the
    results obtained from four weeks of planting till harvesting, the number of leaves
    and height are measured in three days intervals. (Fig. 21, Fig. 22). The average
    value was derived from data collected from 6 Ensabi plantlets at random grown
    with SMART GROW and Soil Medium. This shows that users can easily plant with SMART
    GROW (see Fig. 23a, Fig. 23b). Download : Download high-res image (304KB) Download

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market
    for smart agriculture in the next years. 1.4. Preceding affined review papers

    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may

    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling

    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.

    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely

    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

  description: Electricity is generated by hydropower, a significant renewable energy
    source, in more than 150 nations throughout the world. Given its ability to meet
    the rising need for power while lowering carbon dioxide emissions, hydropower's
    sustainable growth is of the highest significance. With improved monitoring, optimization,
    and assistance for more effective and sustainable operations, the Internet of
    Things (IoT) opens up new opportunities for the sustainable growth of hydropower.
    River levels, turbine efficiency, and cloud cover are just a few of the different
    aspects of hydropower generating that may be tracked using IoT sensors and devices.
    The efficiency of the plant may then be increased by optimising output, cutting
    waste, and reducing downtime using the data that has been collected. This lessens
    the possibility of power interruptions and enables hydropower plants to adapt
    more quickly to variations in energy demand. Hydropower plants can have a smaller
    negative influence on the environment because to IoT technology. Water quality,
    heat, and other vital characteristics may be monitored using ecological surveillance
    devices to make sure that hydropower activities do not have a harmful effect on
    the nearby ecosystems. The system can also assist in reducing the likelihood of
    dam breakdowns and floods by monitoring fluctuations in water volumes and anticipating
    possible dangers. Improved control of electricity storage and transportation is
    another benefit of IoT implementation in the hydropower industry. Energy may be
    conserved during times of little need and supplied during peak times by using
    IoT-enabled smart grids, which eliminates the need for peak power plants that
    burn fossil fuels. This encourages the production of more environmentally friendly
    electricity and lowers overall carbon emissions.

  description: 'Agriculture is the backbone of success of rural countries like India.
    In this way, the proposed procedure is to utilize mechanization and web of thing
    (IoT) innovation to form agribusiness smart. There are currently several commercial
    IoT frameworks for water system planning that create differentiators for water
    monitoring and storage. However, this framework focuses on exploiting newly available
    water resources without controlling the selected water resources. Think about
    it, an inexpensive Arduino-based IoT framework was developed to design a computerized
    water system, and it will provide estimation of water requirements by using low-cost
    available sensors. This paper is around IOT based keen cultivating and water structure
    framework. The extreme motivation of this paper is to computerize the method of
    watering to plants. This work makes a difference us to notice the values of different
    parameters like moisture, temperature, humidity of plants and water them appropriately.
    This can be done utilizing Arduino board, voltage controller and transfer which
    commands the engine. In this paper, we have created an brilliantly water system
    framework that will control the water apportioning to the trim intelligently without
    any administrator and endeavors low-cost Arduino-based water system gadgets, sensors,
    particularly advanced procedures actualized in water system frameworks and farming,
    such as shrewdly water system frameworks. The main vision of this research is
    to detect minimum amount of water needed to nourish plants. Mass of the ranchers

    water system framework for domestic gardening and this framework can be kept up
    without any human checking. It consequently checks the dampness of the soil beneath
    the tree and plants within the domestic cultivate and in case the dampness is
    moo it demonstrates the message and pours water naturally to the plants from the
    water capacity to which it is associated. The exact utilization of water system
    strategy is needed as there may be a requirement of precipitation or there may
    be dried regions. For this cause, a mechanized water system framework is utilized
    in which it is appropriate in all weather conditions. The soil dampness detector
    will sense the water substance and demonstrate either to pump the water or not.
    This will offer assistance to diminish the wastage of water additionally makes
    a difference to grow the plants indeed in the event that the human isn''t physically
    present. The developed IoT framework has been tested in several field tests to
    calculate sensor accuracy, independent monitoring and operation, and usability
    monitoring, and to evaluate its capabilities and functionality. This framework
    appears to have been used effectively for the management and control of various
    water resources: water, groundwater, seawater and wastewater. By extension, it
    has been shown that the frame can be used for long periods without a source of
    control, which will make it a ideal device for using in annual crops.'

    detector will sense the water substance and demonstrate either to pump the water
    or not. This will offer assistance to diminish the wastage of water additionally
    makes a difference to grow the plants indeed in the event that the human isn’t
    physically present. The developed IoT framework has been tested in several field
    tests to calculate sensor accuracy, independent monitoring and operation, and
    usability monitoring, and to evaluate its capabilities and functionality. This
    framework appears to have been used effectively for the management and control
    of various water resources: water, groundwater, seawater and wastewater. By extension,
    it has been shown that the frame can be used for long periods without a source
    of control, which will make it a ideal device for using in annual crops. Topics

  description: Irrigation system is widely used in agriculture sector and has significant
    impacts to the growth of the plantation or crops. Traditional method of irrigation
    system always counter problems such as time consuming, human labour cost, inefficient
    of water usage and monitoring challenging throughout the process. Thus to address
    the issues, this paper proposed the development of smart irrigation system that
    embedded various types of sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) platform used for
    monitoring plant growth. In this work, there are three module have been developed
    which are hardware, software and integration module of the proposed system. In
    hardware module, Raspberry Pi is used to calculate and process the data based
    on the sensors parameters. Different types of sensors have been employed such
    as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, ultrasonic and vision sensors. In this
    framework, the reading of soil moisture sensor was obtained from the base station.
    The Raspberry Pi will receive the information and starts to pump the water from
    the tank until the condition of soil moisture content is normal (i.e. reach the
    threshold value). In addition, the DHT22 sensor will act as the monitoring system
    in terms of temperature and humidity data. While, the ultrasonic sensor will send
    the information to the microprocessor and calculate the water level. Furthermore,
    the webcam vision is used for monitoring the plant growth during the day and night.
    While, the dripping process runs in real-time application to the plant. The microcontroller
    ESP8266 used to control the state of ON or OFF light bulb depending on the value
    of LDR sensor. Based on the results and monitoring process, the proposed smart
    irrigation system able to works in promising environment with real time data in
    which it has been monitored through the IoT platform.

  description: The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems spans a large variety
    of applications, each with unique requirements. Many of these applications relate
    to the management of various cyber-physical systems, including road and rail traffic,
    electricity, water, food/goods transportation and storage, smart building management,
    crime/safety management, underwater systems, etc. Within this context, a growing
    concern is the deployment of IoT systems in extreme environments which may occur
    either because of the nature of the application or due to external factors. Some
    prominent examples of the former are 1) the IoT deployments in hazardous environments
    such as management of chemical or nuclear plants, management of underwater oil/gas
    infrastructure, mining operations, etc.; 2) IoT systems deployed specifically
    to manage accidents and disasters; and 3) IoT systems deployed in arctic/antarctic
    regions where they routinely experience extreme levels of changes in terms of
    temperature, wind conditions, sunlight availability, compression, etc. Such IoT
    systems generally are designed to specifically operate in the challenging environment
    they must operate in, and thus may be expected to be rather robust. However, the
    IoT systems designed to manage the physical infrastructures such as those in urban
    settings may also need to handle unprecedented and unexpected stresses due to
    the worldwide phenomena of aging physical infrastructure, demand that far exceeds
    the designed capacity, and increasingly extreme operating conditions due to climate
    change. This special issue covers all such scenarios and thus represents a vast
    and rich area for innovations.

    Abstract: The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems spans a large variety
    of applications, each with unique requirements. Many of these applications relate
    to the management of various cyber–physical systems, including road and rail traffic,
    electricity, water, food/goods transportation and storage, smart building management,
    crime/safety management, underwater systems, etc. Within this context, a growing
    concern is the deployment of IoT systems in extreme environments which may occur
    either because of the nature of the application or due to external factors. Some
    prominent examples of the former are 1) the IoT deployments in hazardous environments
    such as management of chemical or nuclear plants, management of underwater oil/gas
    infrastructure, mining operations, etc.; 2) IoT systems deployed specifically
    to manage accidents and disasters; and 3) IoT systems deployed in arctic/antarctic
    regions where they routinely experience extreme levels of changes in terms of
    temperature, wind conditions, sunlight availability, compression, etc. Such IoT
    systems generally are designed to specifically operate in the challenging environment
    they must operate in, and thus may be expected to be rather robust. However, the
    IoT systems designed to manage the physical infrastructures such as those in urban
    settings may also need to handle unprecedented and unexpected stresses due to
    the worldwide phenomena of aging physical infrastructure, demand that far exceeds
    the designed capacity, and increasingly extreme operating conditions due to climate
    change. This special issue covers all such scenarios and thus represents a vast

    The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems spans a large variety of applications,
    each with unique requirements. Many of these applications relate to the management
    of various cyber–physical systems, including road and rail traffic, electricity,
    water, food/goods transportation and storage, smart building management, crime/safety
    management, underwater systems, etc. Within this context, a growing concern is
    the deployment of IoT systems in extreme environments which may occur either because
    of the nature of the application or due to external factors. Some prominent examples
    of the former are 1) the IoT deployments in hazardous environments such as management
    of chemical or nuclear plants, management of underwater oil/gas infrastructure,
    mining operations, etc.; 2) IoT systems deployed specifically to manage accidents
    and disasters; and 3) IoT systems deployed in arctic/antarctic regions where they
    routinely experience extreme levels of changes in terms of temperature, wind conditions,
    sunlight availability, compression, etc. Such IoT systems generally are designed
    to specifically operate in the challenging environment they must operate in, and
    thus may be expected to be rather robust. However, the IoT systems designed to
    manage the physical infrastructures such as those in urban settings may also need
    to handle unprecedented and unexpected stresses due to the worldwide phenomena
    of aging physical infrastructure, demand that far exceeds the designed capacity,
    and increasingly extreme operating conditions due to climate change. This special
    issue covers all such scenarios and thus represents a vast and rich area for innovations.
    The IoT systems being deployed around the world in smart cities and other environments
    should anticipate and plan for operation in stressed environments. The robustness/resilience
    scenarios of interest in such environments are usually neither catastrophic nor
    random but may suffer from varying degrees of area damage relatively frequently.
    Thus, the key challenge is to assess damage effectively and with minimal manual
    involvement and accordingly configure or augment the system before, during, and
    after the event, to minimize service degradation, maximize coverage, and optimize
    the services offered. Collaboration across IoT systems potentially owned, and
    operated by different parties can help address this issue but must cope with issues
    of privacy, security, interoperability, and cross-party visibility. Furthermore,
    the situational understanding, which is increasingly based on video and other
    types of rich monitoring, is essential to assess the damage, dispatch work crews
    as needed, provide acceptable service and coverage, avoid conflicts and other
    undesirable behavior, and handle tradeoff between the information sharing and
    the privacy/security needs. Finally, both direct and side-channel attacks enabled
    by increasingly automated control and operation continue to make the security,
    privacy, and resilience of IoT systems even more important, especially in extreme
    environments. We received a total of 56 original submissions from various institutions
    worldwide. Following a rigorous review process, 20 articles have been accepted
    and are included in this special issue of the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.
    These papers cover a broad range of issues and topic areas. We roughly divided
    them into the following four categories: 1) data collection and curation challenges;
    2) network operations and management; 3) management of specific cyber–physical
    Systems; and 4) ensuring security and privacy in extreme environments. In the
    following, we introduce the articles in each area and highlight their main contributions.
    SECTION I. Data Collection and Curation : This category consists of five articles
    on various aspects of data collection and curation for extreme environments and
    includes the issues of data imputation, data balancing, and data restoration.
    The article by Adhikari et al. [A1] discusses the challenge of imputing missing
    data in multivariate time-series data generated by IoT systems, especially in
    cases of extreme missing gaps and rates. The proposed solution utilizes techniques,
    such as multivariate variables, correlation, data fusion, regression, and multiple
    imputations. Extensive experiments with extreme missing gaps and rates ranging
    from 10% to 90% on sensor-generated data demonstrate that the proposed technique
    outperforms baseline techniques in preserving pattern, structure, and trend, even
    in scenarios with 90% extreme missing gaps and missing rates. The article by Chen
    and Wu [A2] proposes collaborative filtering based on scaled lifted augmented
    half quadratic functions to address the problem of excessive sensitivity of traditional
    norms to outliers. The approach introduces auxiliary variables to absorb varying
    levels of data corruption and scaled reweighting forms to enhance resilience against
    oversensitivity. Experiments on open datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
    achieves better recoverability than baselines under different data corruption
    conditions, confirming its effectiveness. The article by Cui et al. [A3] addresses
    the challenge of ensuring the stable operation of IoT systems in extreme environments,
    particularly in infrastructures like energy, aerospace, and healthcare. It highlights
    the vulnerability of resource-constrained devices to malware due to complex operating
    conditions and infrequent maintenance, posing risks of system failure or information
    leakage. To tackle these issues, the article utilizes a many-objective evolutionary
    algorithm to balance data space in different dimensions, including category and
    architectural distribution. Experimental results on IoT malware datasets demonstrate
    that MODSC effectively improves cross-architectural generalization while maintaining
    high confidence levels compared to popular data processing methods. The article
    by Fu et al. [A4] discusses sparse mobile crowdsensing (SMCS) as a solution for
    large-scale data sensing in IoT systems by incorporating area constraints, truthful
    worker recruitment, and sensing map recovery. The scheme emphasizes the importance
    of areas based on historical data differences, identifies trustworthy workers
    using the truthful upper confidence bound algorithm, and employs the deep matrix
    factorization algorithm to infer unsensed data. Experimental results based on
    the China air quality dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
    in improving the platform’s total profit. The article by Li et al. [A5] discusses
    challenges in restoring imagery captured in extreme underwater environments, such
    as blurred details and color distortion. Existing restoration techniques often
    oversimplify by using static attenuation coefficients, leading to inconsistent
    results. To address this, the article introduces scene-depth fusion that dynamically
    considers the spectral decay of light underwater, providing a refined attenuation
    coefficient tailored to the specific scene. The method employs quadtree decomposition
    and depth mapping for precise localization, resulting in a more accurate transmission
    map. Experimental results demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in addressing
    issues like blurred details and chromatic anomalies, outperforming existing methodologies
    in finesse and accuracy in challenging underwater conditions. SECTION II. Network
    Operation and Management : This category contains five articles on such topics
    as multicasting, routing, offloading, threat detection, and management of distributed
    workflows. The article by Chen et al. [A6] discusses the challenges in transmitting
    large volumes of sensing data in maritime environments, highlighting issues with
    satellite links and traditional unicast transmission. It proposes BOOM, a bottleneck-aware
    opportunistic multicast strategy for efficient data delivery in maritime scenarios.
    BOOM considers the influence of bottleneck nodes and broadcasting rates, with
    adaptability to extreme conditions like storms and typhoons. Real-world experiments
    show that BOOM significantly reduces transmission latency, up to 59% in dense
    sensor scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate BOOM’s superiority over other
    algorithms in completion time, particularly in sparse and dense sensor environments,
    with improvements of up to 49%. The article by Verma et al. [A7] introduces AGRIC,
    an AI-based green routing system designed for industrial cyber–physical systems.
    It employs a novel AI-inspired extended spotted hyena Levy flight optimization
    (ESHLFO) algorithm for the election of cluster heads (CHs) in cluster-based routing.
    To address the energy hole problem, the study incorporates four energy-unlimited
    data collection nodes at the network periphery. The experimental results showcase
    that AGRIC improves network longevity and performance, with notable enhancements
    in stability, throughput, and remaining energy, serving as crucial performance
    indicators. The article by Adil et al. [A8] discusses improved routing protocol
    for ad hoc networks by integrating destination-sequenced distance-vector (DSDV),
    which is used for routing information updates, and deep Q-learning for next-hop
    selection based on reward functions. This approach aims to minimize packet loss,
    congestion, end-to-end delay, and communication cost while improving Quality of
    Service (QoS) in extreme environments. Simulations indicate significant improvements
    in performance metrics compared to existing schemes. The article by Kim et al.
    [A9] explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting
    surfaces (IRSs) in mmWave and THz communication systems. The focus is on establishing
    secure offloading systems for ground users through the assistance of the UAV-mounted
    IRS. The goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of battery-limited ground
    user devices while ensuring secure offloading and operability of the UAV-mounted
    IRS. The optimization involves adjusting the transmit power, trajectory, and phase
    shift matrix of the UAV-mounted IRS, as well as the offloading ratio between local
    execution and edge computing using successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms.
    Numerical results indicate significant energy savings compared to local execution
    and partial optimizations. The article by Amjad et al. [A10] highlights the challenge
    of efficiently utilizing IoT resources considering factors like location and battery
    life for comprehensive situational understanding, particularly in emergencies.
    The proposed dynamic approach orchestrates and manages distributed workflow applications
    across cloud data centers, servers, and IoT devices at the network edge. Specifically
    designed for adaptive and knowledge-driven business process workflows, the approach
    proves effective and resilient to situational changes, as demonstrated in a comprehensive
    empirical evaluation. SECTION III. Management of Specific Cyber–Physical Systems
    : This category also consists of six articles on the important topics of landslide
    detection, aquatic ecosystem monitoring, flood risk evaluation, bearing fault
    diagnosis, soil stability prediction, and prediction of power generation. The
    article by Gidon et al. [A11] introduces a bidirectional long short-term memory
    (LSTM) model for landslide detection, focusing on Mawiongrim, Meghalaya, India,
    an active landslide zone. The bidirectional LSTM captures temporal patterns from
    various landslide-related characteristics, including topography, rainfall, hydrological,
    and soil properties. Results indicate that the proposed model achieves higher
    accuracy and lower error rates compared to other models, offering real-time warning
    capabilities for early landslide detection. The research also highlights the significance
    of prediction models for matric suction and groundwater level in determining slope
    stability. The article by deAraújo et al. [A12] introduces the OpenBoat system
    architecture for AI-enabled sailboats with autonomous environment monitoring and
    presents the F-Boat, a fully functional prototype built with commercial off-the-shelf
    components. F-Boat includes low-level control strategies, communication infrastructure,
    edge computing with AI acceleration, and modular support for application-specific
    monitoring systems. Field experiments in Guanabara Bay, Brazil, demonstrate the
    prototype’s functionalities and the AI capabilities of the proposed architecture
    under extreme conditions. The article by Ahmed et al. [A13] develops DeepLab,
    an algorithm for deep learning (DL) from satellite images for flood detection.
    DeepLab uses a convolutional neural network and is trained on extensive satellite
    images with ground truth labels, achieving a high accuracy of 87% in segmentation,
    outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The proposed system combines AI-based
    flood detection with meteorological forecasts and ground-based sensors, offering
    comprehensive flood monitoring for early warning and effective emergency response.
    The article by Hu et al. [A14] discusses the challenges in bearing fault diagnosis
    models related to small sample sizes of faulty data in extreme environments. To
    address this, a real-time bearing fault diagnosis model, named RBFDSCA, is proposed,
    by making use of a Siamese network and convolutional autoencoder. The model is
    designed to learn effectively from limited faulty data. Utilizing an Industrial
    IoT (IIoT) platform for data collection and analysis, RBFDSCA constructs a Siamese
    convolutional autoencoder with positive and negative feature extraction networks.
    The model achieves high performance on a real bearing dataset, confirming its
    effectiveness in addressing the challenges of small sample sizes in bearing fault
    diagnosis. The article by Nandy et al. [A15] addresses the need to continuously
    analyze slope stability, considering changing geospatial and geotechnical parameters.
    To monitor immediate changes, it uses a Fusion-Based Bag-of-Neural Network (FuBoNN)
    model for predicting the Factor of Safety (FoS). The relationship between environmental
    parameters and FOS is acknowledged as nonlinear and complex. The FuBoNN model,
    utilizing a rich dataset created by fusing laboratory data, demonstrates a 0.3%
    error in predicting multiple categories of FOS. Compared to standard machine learning
    models, the proposed approach exhibits a 2.5% improved prediction accuracy, highlighting
    its efficiency in addressing slope stability challenges. The article by Satpathy
    et al. [A16] proposes quantum algorithms to forecast daily power generation, aiding
    energy organizations in making real-time decisions to save energy and costs in
    IoT-extreme environments. Quantum computers, leveraging properties like superposition
    and entanglement, offer superior computational performance with lower energy consumption
    than conventional computers. The article explores various quantum machine learning
    algorithms on datasets related to IoT extreme environments, showing that they
    outperform classical methods in accuracy. SECTION IV. Ensuring Security in Extreme
    Environments : This category contains four articles concerning security issues
    for satellite communications (Satcoms), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), energy-constrained
    IoT devices, and data collection in disaster scenarios. The article by Salim et
    al. [A17] highlights the vulnerability of Satcoms to cyberattacks and the lack
    of equipped policies to address these challenges. In response, the article proposes
    a comprehensive deep federated learning (DFL)-based threat detection model for
    proactive intrusion recognition in Satcoms networks. The model incorporates a
    data-level preprocessing (DLP) mechanism to conceal original data and executes
    Federated Learning rounds on a deep autoencoder. Experimental results show that
    the proposed model surpasses classic/centralized learning versions in terms of
    protecting local data privacy and achieving optimal accuracy for attack detection.
    Additionally, the model, using differential privacy-based DLP, demonstrates high
    accuracy and enhanced privacy over the training data. The article by Xu et al.
    [A18] discusses the challenges in implementing a ranked search system for IoV
    communication using searchable encryption (SE) over cloud infrastructure. The
    paper presents a search scheme that uses an encrypted index tree structure for
    multikeyword ranked retrieval and dynamic updating in IoV, along with a greedy
    breadth-first search for efficient sublinear search. The authors show via security
    analysis and experimental simulation that their system ensures user privacy and
    acceptable efficiency. The article by Zhang et al. [A19] proposes to combine blockchain
    and DL to enhance IoT security. It introduces a Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Learning
    (ZPoL) consensus approach, which replaces the traditional Proof of Work (PoW)
    with the training of a DL model. Additionally, the paper proposes an incentive
    mechanism based on a two-stage Stackelberg game to encourage resource-constrained
    IoT devices to participate in improving the quality of learning. The effectiveness
    of the mechanism in reducing communication, computation, and storage costs is
    shown through simulations and experiments. The article by Jiang et al. [A20] proposes
    mobile crowdsourcing-assisted IoT systems for real-time data collection in disaster
    scenarios. It suggests a re-encryption mechanism for access authorization and
    encrypted task distribution through the cloud. It also proposes a mechanism to
    enhance the verifiability and reputability of reencrypted ciphertext under an
    untrusted cloud setting. While these 20 accepted papers represent significant
    contributions to various aspects of IoT systems operating in extreme environments,
    numerous challenges persist, given the vast scope of the problem. We also believe
    that as the stress on existing physical infrastructures increases and newer, more
    complex infrastructures are deployed, many issues related to handling extreme
    situations—such as harsh operating environments, the necessity to continue operating
    aging infrastructures due to economic limitations, usage beyond designed capacity
    due to increasing urban populations, heightened stresses due to climate change,
    and sophisticated attacks facilitated by increasingly automated IoT systems—will
    become even more critical in the future. We hope that the articles in this special
    issue will inspire further exploration of these complex problems. Finally, as
    guest editors, we would like to convey our appreciation to all of the authors
    who submitted their work to this special issue and congratulate those whose work
    appears here. Our gratitude extends to a large number of anonymous reviewers whose
    insightful feedback not only assisted authors in enhancing their work but also
    facilitated our informed selection of the accepted articles. We would like to
    particularly thank Prof. Nei Kato, the Editor-in-Chief (EiC) of the IEEE Internet
    of Things Journal and his staff, for constant support and advice in making this
    special issue possible. We would also like to thank the former EiC Prof. Honggang
    Wang for providing us the opportunity to organize this special issue. Appendix:

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    temperature sensor and ultrasonic based on the internet of things using NodeMCU.
    The thingspeak platform as storage of the temperature sensor for reading temperature
    using DS18b20 and ultrasonic as a reading difference of water level. The experiment
    of each component by using different methods according to component requirements.
    Based on experiment results, we can conclude that the water reduction rate on
    Aquascape by using an IoT device has a smaller value than on Aquascape without
    an IoT device. On Aquascape, which uses an IoT device, the fan''s condition only
    turns on when the temperature is more than 27 degrees Celsius. That condition
    can reduce the water evaporation caused by the chiller.'

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

  description: This study assessed the effects of rainfall on soil physico-chemical
    properties (pH, moisture, temperature, Nitrogen value, Phosphorus value and Potassium
    value) of MD2 pineapple cultivation on marginal soil, and also investigated correlation
    between rainfall and soil physico-chemical properties based on IoT-based monitoring.
    Agromon Smart Agriculture and NPK Sensors (Agromon) that is equipped with a Sigfox-based
    wireless transmitter was used to provide real-time marginal soil properties data
    from an experimental MD2 pineapple field plot in UiTM Sarawak. Rainfall data between
    March and July 2021 for Samarahan Rainfall Station were obtained from Department
    of Irrigation and Drainage, Sarawak (DID). Soil properties data were transmitted
    from field plot gateway to the nearest Sigfox base station in Santubong, and subsequently
    to SATU dashboard server in order to be accessible to all users. Agromon demonstrated
    the capability of IoT system in monitoring selected soil properties across favored
    and unfavored weather conditions. Pineapple farmers can make timely and cost-effective
    farm operation decision anywhere to optimize plant vigor and therefore, improve
    yield.

    Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar,
    fruits, and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production.
    The extremely familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative
    of viruses and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the
    geographical conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C
    for maturing and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population
    and advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the
    main cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc.
    For this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming,
    arable farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock
    farming is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used
    as natural manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables
    a large number of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming
    is used for the production of crops that include various types of crops from the
    growth of plants it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual
    crops means total life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production
    enclosed by 12 months. Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming,
    nomadic live in arid and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa
    nomadic herd cattle, goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic
    including horses, mux-oxen, yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops
    and raise of livestock. Thus, pesticides take an essential role in the production
    of food and the pesticide industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75
    billion and the Indian industry cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at
    16.7 million. Although there are various types of pesticides used in farming like
    rodenticides larvicides, overuse of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms
    that are similar to humans overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may
    depend on different types of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into
    nitrates, which plants can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150
    billion corrupted. As in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and
    the soil carbon, nitrous oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect
    plants and animals ranging from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds.
    The detection can be done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity,
    and soil moisture readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced
    period of agriculture epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with
    automation is used for the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor
    the plant health for various plants leaf using image processing techniques and
    TensorFlow algorithm.” 1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the
    yields of apples; they show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning
    approach on CNN detection of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1].
    In this paper, they have discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging
    algorithm, image segmentation, and neural network. The image processing is done
    for processing of leaf images by using methods like soft computing and conventional
    method [2]. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast
    resistance is used and examined all rice types which were sensitive root colonization
    by AM fungus [3]. This paper shows plant detection of disease in real time that
    is affected using a convolutional neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread
    on the damaged portion of plants. For improving the accuracy of the system, they
    have used a TensorFlow framework; the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The
    remaining area infected by diseases is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In
    this paper, they show the detection of diseases that affect various plants by
    using image processing techniques. As commonly we know farmers spray pesticides
    on the plants but also affect humans directly and indirectly through health issues
    or any other [4]. This paper uses the technology of ML and processing of image
    to allow the viral disease from the snaps of leaf, and this method identifies
    the injury of potato leaf disease. Their segmentation approaches the utilization
    by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm has used deep learning network for
    detection of tobacco plants in photos captured by using unmanned aerial vehicles.
    This algorithm has three stages the primary stage with morphological and watershed
    segmentation, the second is convolutional neural network is assembled and train
    with tobacco plant region and the third part is post-processing are performed
    to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This paper uses forest in identifying plant
    disease between healthy and disease plants for extracting the features of the
    image. This is used by using the trained dataset to detect the virus by using
    ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation technique that has been
    used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset. As they have also used
    the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is 98.56% [8]. This paper
    shows about image detector and the resource-constrained using a convolutional
    network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the types of plant infection
    [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and challenges for plant leaf
    disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering algorithm [10].
    This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and prediction models
    for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based on image processing
    and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato plant diseases [7].
    They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect the leaves of plants
    but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s why it is difficult
    to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset for solving this they
    have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures of unhealthy plants
    leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot system will start
    activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos; it will check the
    height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will spray the fertilizers
    for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper, then it will again go
    for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if any parasitic detected,
    then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion of plants and send alert
    message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for prototype device Full size
    image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection: TensorFlow: It is a library
    of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations, and it can also create
    models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects leaf spot diseases
    and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm also uses a neural
    network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow should be
    run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing unit and
    mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset 1000
    from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size
    image Fig. 4 Various leaves [19] affected by unwanted pesticides Full size image
    Fig. 5 Boxplot on the affected area of the plants (leaf) Full size image 4 Future
    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm
    by using Blynk cloud Full size image Fig. 7 Blynk app results in real time Full
    size image Fig. 8 Visuino results for temperature and humidity Full size image
    7 Hardware Testing Figure 9 shows the output results of the farm on LCD as ESP32
    is the controller module of IoT as to help the farmers and send the data on cloud.
    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

    Hydroponics Indoor cultivation Internet of things (IoT) Access provided by University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction As per projections
    by the United Nations Department of Economics and Social Affairs (2021), the global
    population is estimated to reach approximately 9.8 billion by the year 2050, leading
    to the need of 59–98% increase in global food demand. Increasing crop production
    globally is urgently needed to meet these challenges [1]. Embracing innovative
    solutions such as IoT-based hydroponic cultivations has become imperative to uplift
    and revolutionize the agriculture sector. Hydroponics is a method of cultivating
    crops in nutrient solutions and it has gained significant attention due to its
    vast number of advantages [2]. The nutrient solution is pivotal in this approach
    and should ensure that it provides all the necessary elements for optimal plant
    development. Hence, in hydroponics, it is vital to maintain specific properties
    of the nutrient solution such as pH and electrical conductivity (EC), in their
    optimal ranges. Additionally, crucial environmental factors such as light intensity,
    temperature, and humidity must also be carefully regulated. Continuous and precise
    monitoring of these parameters is imperative to ensure optimal function and robust
    plant growth [3]. Indoor cultivation of food crops is a promising new technology
    that utilizes artificial lighting to optimize agricultural production [4]. Indoor
    hydroponics can be employed in unfavorable climatic and urban environments [5].
    Artificial light significantly enhances the efficiency of indoor hydroponic systems
    compared to natural light [6] through regulating plant growth and physiological
    processes. Different wavelengths, intensities, and photoperiods affect plants
    differently [7]. Integrating IoT in indoor hydroponics allows for monitoring parameters
    such as pH, EC, light intensity, temperature, humidity, and system regulation
    [8]. IoT-based hydroponics reduces the need for human resources, minimizes errors,
    and reduces lead time, ultimately resulting in higher yields and better crop quality
    [9]. However, the specialized sensors and automation lead to increased costs compared
    to traditional field crop cultivation. Therefore, the focus is on the crops that
    offer relatively high profitability, demand, and yield. Due to its high economic
    and nutritional value, lettuce is widely chosen for IoT-based hydroponics cultivation
    [10]. Considering the above facts, this study was carried out to evaluate the
    feasibility of lettuce cultivation within an indoor hydroponics system by monitoring
    the essential parameters using an IoT device designed and developed for this cause.
    2 Literature Review 2.1 Hydroponic Cultivation in Indoor Settings Hydroponics,
    a soilless farming technique that involves growing plants in nutrient-rich water
    solutions, has gained widespread recognition for its resource efficiency, reduced
    environmental impact, and ability to produce higher yields in limited spaces.
    By eliminating the need for soil, hydroponics minimizes water usage, mitigates
    soil-borne diseases, and enables year-round cultivation, making it an ideal solution
    for urban and indoor farming [2]. The adaptability and scalability of hydroponics
    have opened up new possibilities for efficient food production in urban areas
    and regions with limited land availability. The hydroponic system being used varies
    according to the crop species, local climate, and budget. Drip system, nutrient
    film technique (NFT), ebb and flow, and Aeroponics are the most commonly used
    hydroponics systems. The concept of indoor cultivation is gaining momentum worldwide,
    with cities like Japan and Qatar at the forefront of adopting this innovative
    approach. The potential of indoor hydroponics to produce substantial quantities
    of food for more than 60% of the urban population has sparked interest in its
    widespread implementation [11]. By maintaining a controlled environment, indoor
    cultivation allows for precise control over environmental conditions, providing
    optimized crop growth. One unique feature of indoor farming is using artificial
    light instead of relying on sunlight. This provides flexibility in cultivating
    crops regardless of weather changes and allows for year-round production without
    dependence on growing seasons. LED lights have become a popular choice as a light
    source in indoor hydroponics cultivation [7, 12]. 2.2 IoT in Hydroponics In recent
    years, the integration of cutting-edge technology in agriculture has revolutionized
    traditional farming practices, paving the way for innovative and sustainable cultivation
    methods. IoT technology empowers growers with real-time data monitoring, automated
    control, and data-driven decision-making to optimize and enhance the hydroponic
    farming process when integrated into hydroponics. This has revolutionized how
    hydroponic systems are managed, enhancing productivity, precision, and sustainability.
    Smart devices and sensors such as pH meters, EC sensors, and temperature and humidity
    sensors can be used to continuously monitor crucial parameters such as nutrient
    levels, pH balance, temperature, and environmental conditions, ensuring optimal
    growing conditions for plants [8, 11]. Growers can access this data remotely through
    web interfaces or mobile applications, allowing for timely adjustments and interventions
    as needed [1]. 3 Material and Methods 3.1 Determination of the Optimum Light Spectrum
    and Intensity Conditions for Hydroponic Lettuce Cultivation Preparation of hydroponic
    systems The experiment was carried out to evaluate the optimum light spectrum
    and intensity conditions for hydroponic lettuce cultivation in an indoor setting.
    Deep Water Culture (DWC) hydroponic cultivation method was set up using Styrofoam
    boxes. The appropriate amount of Albert''s solution (nutrient solution with a
    well-balanced mix of nutrients) was dissolved in water to achieve the desired
    electrical conductivity (EC) value. The nutrient solution was renewed weekly,
    ensuring the plants received an optimal mix of nutrients for their development.
    The pH of the nutrient solution was kept in the ideal range (5.5–6.5) using NaOH
    and HCl solutions. The nutrient solution was aerated using an oxygen pump strategically
    programmed with a sinotimer. The pump''s programming enabled it to turn on and
    off periodically throughout the day, providing a consistent oxygen supply to the
    hydroponic system. The sinotimer was preprogrammed to activate the oxygen pump
    four times a day, optimizing oxygen delivery without unnecessary wastage of resources.
    This automation reduced human intervention and enhanced the system''s efficiency
    by maintaining a consistent and well-controlled aeration schedule. Plant Materials
    and Growth Conditions The experiment commenced by sowing seeds of “Grand Rapids”
    lettuce in grow trays filled with moistened coir, creating an optimal germination
    environment. Lettuce seedlings were nurtured under a controlled condition of 500
    lx of LED white light, with a photoperiod of 16 h per day for a duration of 15
    days. After 15 days, the lettuce seedlings that reached the 5-leaf stage were
    transplanted into the hydroponic systems, ensuring that the roots were immersed
    in the nutrient solution. To maintain an ideal nutrient concentration in the solution,
    EC was maintained at 1500 μS/cm. Throughout the experiment, the lettuce plants
    were consistently monitored to ensure that they received the right light, nutrients,
    and pH levels essential for their growth. Application of Light Treatments The
    experiment comprised a total of five treatments (listed below), each with three
    replicates. Each replicate had six lettuce plants. All treatments were maintained
    throughout the experiment under a consistent 16-h light and 8-h dark photoperiod
    to ensure uniform conditions. Five different treatments provided for the lettuce
    plants were as follows: 1. L1—LED White light with a Photosynthetic Photon Flux
    Density (PPFD) set at 200 μmolm−2 s−1. 2. L2—white:blue:red light with a ratio
    of 1:1:1 and PPFD of 200 μmolm−2 s−1. 3. L3—blue:red light with a ratio of 1:1
    and a PPFD of 200 μmolm−2 s−1. 4. L4—sunlight simulation inside the experimental
    room (indoor control). 5. L5—natural sunlight outside the building (outdoor control).
    Thick white polythene sheets were used to segregate and control the different
    light treatment groups. Four LED white lights with an output of 18W each were
    employed for treatments involving LED lights to achieve the targeted PPFD of 200
    μmolm−2 s−1. In specific treatments, such as white:blue:red and blue:red light,
    three LED strips from each color were utilized to create the desired light spectrum.
    Throughout the experiment, the number of parameters of the lettuce plants were
    measured weekly for four weeks. These parameters included plant height, number
    of leaves, length and width of the leaves, and the relative chlorophyll content.
    The plant''s fresh and dry weights were also assessed at the treatments’ 2nd,
    3rd, and 4th weeks. By systematically evaluating these parameters over time and
    across the different treatments, the study aimed to elucidate the effects of various
    light conditions on the growth and development of lettuce plants. The data taken
    was statistically analyzed using R software. 3.2 Design and Development of the
    IoT Device An IoT device is designed for monitoring and measuring nutrient solution
    parameters and growth environment, including TDS, pH, light intensity, temperature,
    and humidity. It is comprised two separate circuits. The first circuit integrates
    an Arduino UNO microcontroller and a NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. It incorporates
    a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity measurements, a BH1750 sensor for
    light intensity measurements, and a gravity analog pH sensor for pH measurements.
    The second circuit utilizes a gravity analog TDS sensor, connected to an ESP 32
    Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module for measuring total dissolved solids content. Before
    usage, the gravity analog pH sensor and TDS sensor were calibrated for accurate
    measurements. The device utilizes two OLED displays to exhibit parameter readings
    from both circuits, and two push buttons facilitate data retrieval. The collected
    sensor data is transmitted to the microcontroller and relayed to Google Docs through
    the Wi-Fi module. TDS sensor data is also sent to a separate Google Doc through
    the ESP 32 Wi-Fi module. Real-time values are displayed on the device OLED display
    during operation. Moreover, a red LED indicates a lack of connection with the
    Wi-Fi network, ensuring prompt awareness of connectivity status. The versatility
    and portability of the designed device make it a valuable tool for hydroponic
    growers, allowing them to efficiently monitor crucial parameters and store data
    in the cloud for analysis and record-keeping. The prototype of the IoT device
    is visually represented, as illustrated in Fig. 1, showcasing its potential to
    revolutionize hydroponic cultivation through advanced IoT-based monitoring and
    control capabilities. Fig. 1 Prototype of “hydromata” device Full size image 3.3
    “Hydromata” Android Application The “Hydromata” Android application depicted in
    Figs. 2a–f was designed and developed to present the parameter readings retrieved
    from the corresponding IoT device. It is a tool for hydroponic enthusiasts and
    growers, providing real-time access to critical environmental parameters, historical
    data, insightful analysis, customizable settings, and quick parameter status checks.
    Its user-friendly interface and comprehensive functionalities ensure that users
    can optimize their hydroponic systems for superior crop growth and productivity.
    Fig. 2 Main interfaces of the “hydromata” Android application Full size image
    The application includes five distinct options, each catering to specific functionalities.
    The option, “Parameter,” is a dashboard, showcasing real-time values of various
    critical environmental parameters. These parameters encompass temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) (Fig. 2c). “History,” shown
    in Fig. 2d, provides the historical data accumulated for the two circuits. This
    feature empowers users to delve into past performance, gaining insights and trends
    from previous parameter readings. The “Analysis” feature (Fig. 2e) provides in-depth
    analysis and visualization,” which generates a diverse array of plots based on
    historical data. These plots present a clear and comprehensive picture of temperature,
    humidity, pH, light intensity, and EC trends over time, facilitating data-driven
    decision-making. The option “Settings” allows users to set personalized minimum
    and maximum values for the optimum range of each parameter. This customization
    empowers users to tailor the hydroponic system to their specific requirements,
    ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth (Fig. 2f). To enhance ease of use
    and efficiency, “Check” lets users promptly assess whether the current parameter
    values fall within specific predefined ranges, displaying relevant messages and
    guiding users on the relevant status. 4 Results and Discussion The observations
    of the vegetative growth of lettuce under different light spectrums and intensity
    conditions are shown in Fig. 3. The “Hydromata” device provided accurate measurements
    for all the parameters in indoor hydroponic lettuce cultivation. Figure 4 illustrates
    the graphs showing the readings from sensors for room temperature, room humidity,
    and pH. Fig. 3 Observations of the vegetative growth of lettuce under different
    light spectrum and intensity conditions (L1—white LED, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1,

    Figure 5 shows the mean data of the growth parameters received after statistical
    analysis. Based on the mean height data of lettuce, treatments L1 (white LED,
    PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1) exhibited significantly higher growth during weeks 1
    and 2 compared to L2, L3, L4, and L5 (Fig. 5a). However, during weeks 3 and 4,
    both L1 and L2 (white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1) showed comparable
    growth, indicating their equal effectiveness for optimal lettuce growth (Fig.
    5a). Fig. 5 Growth curve obtained for lettuce using a mean height values, b mean
    number of leaves, c mean leaf length, d mean leaf width, e mean relative chlorophyll
    content Full size image On the other hand, L4 (indoor control) displayed significantly
    lower growth throughout the experiment. L3 (blue:red = 1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2
    s−1) exhibited a similar growth pattern to L5 (outdoor control) throughout the
    experiment. L4 displayed lower growth compared to the other treatments, reaffirming
    the significant contribution of artificial light treatments to lettuce height
    increase (Fig. 5a). Regarding the mean number of leaves, treatments L1, L2, and
    L3 showed no significant difference during weeks 2, 3, and 4, indicating that
    the light conditions provided were equally beneficial. In contrast, L4 (indoor
    control) displayed significantly lower leaf numbers than all other treatments.
    Figure 5b demonstrates that L2 had the highest leaf growth throughout the 4 weeks,
    with L3 displaying a similar trend until week 2, followed by a decrease. L1''s
    growth was comparable to L5 until week 2, after which it increased. L4 had lower
    leaf number compared to the other treatments, emphasizing the significant impact
    of artificial light on leaf number increase. Examining mean leaf length data,
    L1 and L2 consistently exhibited relatively high lengths, signifying the effectiveness
    of white LED, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1, and white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200
    μmolm−2 s−1 for lettuce growth. L4 displayed significantly lower growth compared
    to all other treatments. Figure 5c reveals that L1 and L2 achieved higher growth
    throughout the 4 weeks than other treatments, while L4''s growth remained lower.
    In terms of mean leaf width data, L2 (white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2
    s−1) exhibited significantly higher growth during weeks 1, 2, and 3 compared to
    other treatments, suggesting its superiority as the best light combination for
    optimal lettuce growth. Figure 5d shows L2 with the highest and most rapid growth
    throughout the experiment. Regarding mean relative chlorophyll content of leaves,
    L2 showed significantly higher growth during weeks 1 and 2 compared to all other
    treatments. Figure 5e shows that L2 had the highest chlorophyll content growth,
    and L3 had similar growth to L5 throughout the experiment. By week 3, all treatments
    (L1, L2, L3, L4) showed similar growth to each other, while L4’s growth remained
    lower. The fresh and dry weight, L2, had a relatively higher mean fresh and dry
    weight throughout the experiment. A similar study by Lin et al. [13] reported
    higher biomass in lettuce grown under red–blue–white (RBW) LED light compared
    to red–blue (RB) LED light. White LEDs offer a broad spectrum, including red,
    blue, and green light, which allows deeper light penetration into plant canopies.
    This, in turn, enhances plant growth and development. The number of leaves directly
    affects the harvestable yield of leafy vegetables such as lettuce. Ensuring increased
    leaves during the early growth stages can positively impact overall yield. During
    the experiment, lettuce seedlings initially grew under natural light with low
    intensity, resulting in leggy seedlings and seedling losses. Subsequently, LED
    white light was introduced to provide optimal light intensity levels for proper
    seedling growth. The “Hydromata” device collects data from sensors placed within
    the system, which is then centralized in a microcontroller. This collected data
    is wirelessly transmitted to a Google Form via a Wi-Fi module. However, the device
    does have some limitations, particularly with the gravity analog TDS sensor used
    to measure TDS and EC values of the nutrient solution. This sensor can only measure
    TDS values within the 0–1000 ppm range. Assessing the vegetative growth of lettuce
    involved monitoring various parameters such as plant height, number of leaves,
    leaf width, leaf length, relative chlorophyll content, fresh and dry weight. Increases
    in leaf length and width directly impact leaf area, enhancing photosynthetic capacity
    and overall biomass. 5 Conclusion IoT-controlled “Hydromata” device, which was
    developed to monitor essential parameters important for hydroponic cultivations
    such as humidity, temperature, pH, and EC, had been able to provide accurate and
    reliable data. The key advantage of this device lies in its portability, enabling
    its application across diverse cultivation areas. The experimental results demonstrated
    that artificial light significantly influenced the growth of lettuce in terms
    of height, number of leaves, leaf width, relative chlorophyll content, fresh and
    dry weight. The best combination for optimal lettuce growth was found to be white:blue:red = 1:1:1,
    with PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1. References Lakshmanan R, Djama M, Selvaperumal SK,

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart

    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

    IEEE Conference Location: Stellenbosch, South Africa SECTION I. Introduction Water
    scarcity and inefficient water management in agricultural practices have become
    major concerns worldwide. Traditional irrigation techniques frequently cause overwatering
    or under watering, which reduces crop yields and wastes water. The ESP32 microcontroller-based
    smart irrigation system we demonstrate in this research combines sensor data,
    connectivity, and intelligent control to provide accurate and effective water
    management. Agriculture has been essential for sustaining human diets for thousands
    of years. However, global food production has been declining since the twentieth
    century due to rising population and shrinking cultivable land. The global population
    is expected to increase to 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050. Furthermore,
    the growing threat of global warming has had a significant impact on agricultural
    productivity around the world. With agriculture employing 75% of the global population,
    there is an urgent need for solutions to address the ongoing food production crisis
    and combat global warming. South Africa has the largest agricultural land on the
    African continent. As of 2020, the country’s agricultural land amounted to over
    96 million hectares and still be ranked as one of the 30 driest countries in the
    world with an average rainfall of about 40% less than the annual world average
    rainfall. Water management is needed and to address this situation, various strategies
    and innovative agricultural practices need to be implemented to uplift the farming
    culture. Researchers have proposed different approaches to monitor irrigation
    using embedded system technology. These approaches involve the use of smart systems
    to assess moisture content and plant growth. Automation of irrigation systems
    can be achieved by continuously monitoring moisture levels and activating the
    irrigation system accordingly, rather than relying on predefined schedules. Some
    systems utilize solenoid tubes to control irrigation, cutting off water supply
    when the desired moisture level is reached. These developments can significantly
    benefit regions facing water scarcity by increasing agricultural productivity.
    This paper discusses a smart agricultural system that assists farmers in efficiently
    managing water levels. The system consists of a controller unit and various sensors,
    including moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level sensors. Data from
    these sensors is transmitted between the cloud and the system through both wired
    and wireless connections. The system incorporates a mobile app that enables users
    to control water irrigation. By making use of technologies such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and wireless communication, farmers can design irrigation plans
    based on their specific agricultural profiles, optimizing water usage according
    to user input. Additionally, moisture sensors continuously monitor soil dryness,
    and plant root temperature is monitored for smart farming practices. The system
    processes sensor data and triggers actuators to transmit information online to
    the application as shown on figure 1. Fig. 1. System structure of the proposed
    design. Show All Numerical calculations based on the sensor data are performed
    to control water irrigation. Effective planning of water systems and fertilization
    is crucial for proper crop development. Environmental factors such as humidity,
    climate conditions, and pesticide usage also influence water consumption. Therefore,
    data on challenging climate conditions are collected and utilized to make informed
    decisions to increase crop production. For instance, hot, dry, sunny, and windy
    conditions require more water for irrigation, while cold, humid, snowy, and less
    humid conditions require less water. The process involves three steps as shown
    in Fig. 1: data collection, data processing, and obtaining results. Initially,
    environmental information is collected through sensor nodes, which is then transmitted
    to the processing unit. The data is subsequently fed into three different microcontrollers,
    controlling distinct operations. After processing, the results are directed to
    their respective outputs, including a liquid crystal display commonly called LCD
    display, the water pump, and the Telegram app. Briefly, the results of the research
    will contribute to agriculture by enabling users to rationalize water and power
    usage as well as reducing financial cost. After the introduction, the paper has
    five major sections to in order to get results expected. Firstly, a deep literature
    review was done to gain insight information on the smart irrigation system. Secondly,
    after choosing an appropriate approach, the next section is to clarify the methodology
    that will be apply which is the design science research method. In addition, the
    budget and component list are discussed into the same section. Thirdly, the results
    will be presented and explained in relationship to the objective assigned. The
    last section of this paper is conclusion followed by references. SECTION II. Literature
    review The concept of precision farming or smart farming has been in existence
    for nearly thirty years, and numerous research projects have been conducted in
    this field. Wireless sensor networks have been utilized to collect field information
    such as temperature, soil moisture, and pH levels, enabling real-time monitoring
    through IoT technology. Researchers in [1] and [3] developed an ESP32-based and
    Arduino-based model based on soil moisture sensing which is the most used approach.
    Some systems have been developed specifically for farmers with limited technological
    knowledge, employing a smart control board to monitor the entire system. Several
    research studies have focused on greenhouse temperature and humidity monitoring
    systems, providing real-time data through IoT using boards like NodeMcu. Some
    studies such as [2] used a solar powered irrigation system with incorporated soil
    moisture data along with temperature and humidity measurements. A cloud-based
    greenhouse [3] environment monitoring system has been proposed, storing temperature
    and humidity data on a web server. The concept of urban farming has gained attention
    due to decreasing cultivable land and increasing urban populations. Research has
    explored alternatives to conventional glass greenhouses, such as fully polythene-covered
    steel structures known as Poly Houses, which incorporate various sensors to monitor
    different aspects of the environment [3]. Efficient irrigation methods have been
    a key focus in precision farming research based on advanced techniques involving
    machine learning [8], computer vision, and unmanned aerial vehicles are also being
    employed in precision farming. While numerous research articles exist on greenhouse
    climate control, IoT-based farm monitoring systems, and irrigation systems, there
    is a lack of integration among these components into a comprehensive IoT-based
    precision farming solution. This project aims to fill that gap by combining all
    aspects of precision farming into a single IoT-based farm environment controller
    with a smart irrigation system. The system enables monitoring and control of the
    climate both locally and remotely, as well as automatic irrigation without human
    intervention. SECTION III. Methodology A. System Architecture Fig. 2. DC power
    supply, dc-dc buck converter powering the system. Show All Fig. 2 is a complete
    illustration of the functional block diagram of the smart irrigation system developed.
    It is powered to a 220-volt ac source and uses a power supply to convert to dc.
    Finally, a buck converter, a dc-to-dc converter will step down the dc voltage
    in order to supply the entire system. As inputs to my ESP32 microcontroller, the
    system makes use of one digital sensor for temperature and humidity sensing (DHT11),
    three soil moisture sensors and one water level sensor to check the water level
    in the tank. The ESP32 has an integrated Wi-Fi feature that will enable the system
    to be monitored in real time via telegram and are display on the LCD screen. The
    pump gets activated via a relay through output pins of the microcontroller. B.
    Harware Development Fig. 3 illustrates the hardware design of the water monitoring
    system. Fig. 3. The functional block diagram of the system. Show All The main
    component of this project is the ESP32, it is a development board, a series of
    low-cost and low power systems on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi
    and dual-mode Bluetooth. It has 36 General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO) pins,
    18 on each side of the board. The schematic diagram is designed using Fritzing
    Software. Five sensors are connected to the microcontroller which are DHT11, soil
    moisture and water level. Their signal pins are connected respectively to pin
    2, 3, 4, 6 and 27 while their positive and negative are respectively connected
    to +3V3 and GND pins of the ESP32. The LCD screen has 4-pin, I2C module mounted
    at the back, which are connected to Vin, GND, SDA and SCL pin of the microcontroller.
    The 20 by 4 LCD screen does not have enough space to display all information continuously,
    a push button switch is used to switch between screens to enable the user to see
    the data and it is connected to pin 10 of the microcontroller. And finally, the
    relay module is used to activate the pump, it has 5 pins connected to pin Vin,
    GND, 7, 8 and 9 of the ESP32. The component used in the schematic are listed in
    table 1. TABLE I. LIST OF COMPONENT C. Software Development Fig. 4. Arduino IDE
    interface. Show All Fig. 4 depicts the Arduino IDE interface. The Arduino IDE
    interface plays the main role of this section as it will be used to program the
    ESP32 DevKit module board. This last one has assigned pins on the hardware that
    can be software controllable as well. Those pins can be assigned considering their
    pin numbering or position such GPIO 27, GPIO16, GPIO33. The microcontroller recognizes
    the number assigned to the GPIO as a port to interact with. Considering the previous
    example those ports will be 25, 16 and 33. Any GPIO input of the ESP32 can be
    used as digital input to read external digital signals interacting with the microcontroller
    such as small push buttons or digital sensors. The major priority is given to
    the push button. The interrupt command acts as its name, while the program is
    running, it gives the priority to a group of commands that are under the interrupt
    loop. In the current project, the interrupt will be used to read the state of
    the push button switch which will result in starting the process and switching
    the display from the main menu to the measured values screen and vice versa as
    shown in Fig. 5. The second priority is given to the communication process between
    the ESP2 and cell phone via Telegram text message anytime once the process has
    started. 4 Analogue sensors are being used (3 soil moisture sensors and 1 water
    level), and will use GPIO pins with an analogue to digital conversion capability
    those are GPIO 32, GPIO36, GPIO 39 & GPIO34 strictly input and 1 digital sensor
    that is the DHT11. The digital sensor will use GPIO27 as a signal input pin. The
    DHT11 has the 3rd priority when it comes to temperature going lower than 4º Celsius
    to prevent plants from frost and overwatering. Some components require special
    libraries that are not included by default on the Arduino IDE interface, and those
    must be individually added. Those components are the I2C LCD display and the DHT
    sensor as well. The recorded data can be viewed into Telegram, which is a cross-platform
    cloud-based instant messaging. This application was chosen for its ability to
    create bots, these small programs are found on the servers and we can “call” them
    at any time to get hundreds of different functionalities to use with our chats
    in the application. Fig. 5. Software design flowchart. Show All Fig. 5 is an illustration
    of the software design logic. Other software were used in order to build this
    project. The schematic diagram and PCD were done using Autodesk Eagle and physical
    or practical model using fritzing. To ensure the proper operation of the system,
    a simulated model was developed using Proteus. When the device gets powered, the
    LCD goes ON, it will establish the wi-fi communication and get IP address from
    the internet sharing device (router, cellphone or laptop). The moisture sensor
    on its location will provide, the moisture level of the soil it is placed on.
    Before starting any irrigation process, the water level sensor checked the level
    of water, to protect the motor from running inefficiently. An LCD screen is used
    to give the state of each sensor placed on a particular field (moisture, temperature
    and water level in the tank). The user can use their mobile phone, tablet or laptop
    to view the readings and this is achievable through Wi-Fi communication. The complete
    flowchart of the design is illustrated in Fig 6. Fig. 6. Complete flowchart of
    the system. Show All Fig. 6 shows the flow diagram of the entire process as explained
    on the section above. SECTION IV. Results A. Hardware Prototype Fig. 7 presents
    the prototype of the smart and safe irrigation system. The ESP32 is placed on
    a printed circuit board (PCB) and the combination with the power supply, relay
    module, the dc-to-dc converter are placed into a black project enclosure. While
    the LCD sticks on top of the box. The ESP32 is connected to the rest of the equipment
    via terminal blocks. The wiring is made using category 6 network cables and they
    are soldered with components to the other end. The water level sensor is placed
    in the water reservoir to show the current level of water. The three pumps are
    immersed into water and are irrigating the fields placed in the 3 plastic plant
    pots via green pipes where the moisture sensors are placed. Fig. 7. Complete setup
    of the smart and safe irrigation system. Show All B. Data Analysis The irrigation
    data is collected over a period of a day and on three different fields and are
    plotted as shown in the graph in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. The soil is dry if
    the moisture reading is between 0 and 300. If the moisture reading is above 300
    and the temperature and irrigation window are in the proper range, the ESP32 activates
    the pump to irrigate the field. The soil is considered wet if the reading is between
    301 and 600, and very wet if the reading is above 600 and the pump has to go off.
    Fig. 8. Field 1 sensors results. Show All Fig. 8 shows the results obtained on
    field 1. The result shows the values recorded by the sensor at a particular time
    of the day. The parameters monitored are soil moisture level, environmental temperature
    and humidity. The external conditions play a considerable role. It is observed
    that the sensor is performing within the range and irrigation process takes places
    more during the day around peak time than at night. Fig. 9. Field 2 sensors results.
    Show All Fig. 9 shows the results obtained on field 2. They are related to the
    result recorded on field 2 reinforcing the accuracy of the sensing devices for
    the same parameters. Fig. 10. Field 3 sensors results. Show All Fig. 10 shows
    the results obtained on field 3. All three fields are giving similar readings
    for the given interval. Fig. 11. Irrigation duration per field. Show All The 3
    fields are exposed to the same environment (ambient temperature and humidity).
    From the results shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, a parallelism can be observed
    in their behavior. The moisture level of the 3 tends to decrease during the day,
    especially at peak hour when it requires more irrigation than at night. On the
    other hand, the humidity during the night tends keep the moisture constant until
    sunrise. On the other, the time required to irrigate the 3 fields also follow
    the trend as shown in Fig. 11. The average time being 1578 seconds or 26 minutes.
    The values recorded can be viewed via telegram, the user will have to send a text
    in the telegram bot to request readings. Fig. 12. Requested data from Telegram.
    Show All Fig. 12 is an illustration of the telegram request. The user will have
    to send the command \"/Start\" in other to receive the opportunity to send the
    second command \"/readings\" to request the readings. C. Advantages Improves water
    efficiency by sing sensors to measure soil moisture levels, weather data, and
    other environmental factors. This approach intends to prevent over-watering or
    underwatering. Remote Control capability increases flexibility. This allows for
    easy adjustments to watering schedules and other settings, even when the user
    is away from their garden. Cost Savings It takes into consideration personal safety,

    CONCLUSION This paper presents the concept of utilizing smart agriculture and
    irrigation systems for crop and water management by public users especially by
    farmers. The various data recorded such as soil moisture level, tank level, temperature
    as well as humidity through sensors are fed into the ESP32 and accessible via
    telegram. The visualization of this data enabled the demonstration of automatic
    watering of crops. By utilizing these systems, the user can make well-informed
    decisions regarding the irrigation process. It enables the user to optimize the
    water usage as well as the irrigation schedule. Additionally, the integration
    of a smart irrigation system allows prevention of overwatering and underwatering.
    By decreasing the dependance on human labor, this system encourages sustainable
    and effective agricultural methods, resulting in improved agricultural results
    for healthier plants. It is expected that the practical integration of an IoT-based
    monitoring and smart irrigation systems represent a step toward affordable and
    sustainable farming technology. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More

    New breakthroughs have been made by humans since generations ago. Every time people
    experience changes and discover new things, they called them technologies. In
    the last several decades, wireless-based network access and resources develop
    rapidly and in some ways have replaced wired networks. Lately, one of the newest
    inventions that has been implemented and is still being developed is the Internet
    of Things (IoT). This is due to its advantages relating to functionality and interoperability
    without the use of cables. In this digital era, IoT is needed by many kinds of
    businesses in various industrial sectors [1]. With the advent of IoT, many businesses
    are evolving successfully, creating advanced innovations and services with smart
    and integrated technologies. Data mining is a procedure of gathering or dredging
    and processing data to acquire valuable information [2]. This process of gathering
    and extracting information can be achieved using software that can perform either
    mathematics, statistical calculations, or Artificial Intelligence. To analyze
    data, one can use more accurate information filtering techniques. These techniques
    are usually performed to find certain patterns that still have relevance to the
    goals or instructions from users. One of the data mining techniques is classification.
    Classification is an action for predicting an object’s class that serves to conclude
    several definitions of characteristics in a group or a class. C4.5 is a data mining
    algorithm for classification of data with numeric and categorical attributes.
    It works by forming a decision tree, which is a method that is used for prediction
    and classification. One can use it for data exploration and also for finding invisible
    relationships between some potential input variables and a target variable. A
    classification process produces rules, which are used for predicting the value
    of a new record’s discrete type attribute. Data mining helps IoT devices communicate
    intelligently. This happens as IoT devices that are equipped with one of the data
    mining techniques not only be able to collect various data but also can perform
    more complex analytical capabilities. These include data collection, network management,
    and even algorithm development [3]. Hence, at the beginning, a machine can only
    respond to commands from users directly, but now it can run various activities
    on its own without waiting for instructions from users. Thus, IoT devices can
    provide various sources of complete data and information which are the outcome
    of algorithm analysis. This article presents implementations of C4.5 in IoT-based
    monitoring systems. Specifically, the systems to monitor two activities that can
    be found in people’s daily lives—caring for ornamental fish in an aquarium and
    growing ornamental plants. Sometimes, these activities can be troublesome for
    people who are busy, because they must regularly check the condition of the objects
    that are being taken care. IoT technology helps people by using sensors to periodically
    get and send data for analysis. For the aquarium case, IoT system can give recommendation
    to users based on the aquarium water condition, while for the ornamental plant
    case, it gives recommendation based on the soil condition. The main contributions
    of this article are: 1. The design and implementation of a wireless monitoring
    and recommendation system for aquarium. It utilizes a NodeMCU ESP8266 and three
    sensors: temperature, turbidity, and ultrasonic sensors. 2. The design and implementation
    of a wireless monitoring and recommendation system for ornamental plants. It utilizes
    a NodeMCU ESP8266, an Arduino Uno, and three sensors: temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH sensors. 3. The implementation of C4.5 to analyze sensor data to give
    recommendation regarding monitoring condition for users. Parts of this work have
    been presented in [4] and [5]. This article is arranged into several sections
    as follows. Some works that are considered relevant to this article are given
    in Sect. 2. Section 3 presents the wireless monitoring system design, and Sect.
    4 gives detailed classification method. Aquarium monitoring and ornamental plant
    monitoring are elaborated in detail in Sects. 5 and 6, respectively. Then, Sect.
    7 summarizes this work and mentions some further research directions. 2 Related
    Works IoT (The Internet of Things) uses Internet technology to allow ordinary
    objects exchange data wirelessly. To be able to communicate, some battery-operated
    or batteryless sensor devices [6] are attached to these objects. One example is
    a device with a soil moisture sensor for an automatic plant watering system [7].
    The program ran in a WeMos DI module gave low and high values to a relay. When
    moisture was detected by the soil moisture sensor, it sent data to WeMos DI so
    it could control a connected relay to activate a water pump. Another example is
    a chilli irrigation system [8]. It had a soil moisture sensor that was attached
    to a NodeMCU, so it could detect and sent data to NodeMCU. NodeMCU notified a
    relay by sending a signal to turn on an irrigation pump. Nowadays, people deal
    with massive amounts of data. Huge amounts of data are generated from many kinds
    of sources every day. The data can be new and can be processed into meaningful
    information. Data mining is a procedure for examining data sets to determine their
    relationships and summarize them in an easy-to-understand manner. With data mining,
    people can perform automated or semi-automated analysis for large amounts of data
    to obtain some patterns that are previously unknown. Some methods applied in data
    mining are clustering, classification, and association rules. Data mining’s analysis
    result can support decision making, that is supported by knowledge. In [9], data
    mining was utilized to analyze sentiment or public opinion toward the presidential
    candidate in the 2019 general election in Indonesia. The tweet data were collected
    by Twitter by scraping the data. In [10], data mining’s linear discriminant analysis
    method was used to identify reproductive organs in Brachypelma tarantula species.
    Various data mining methods are used in practical implementations. Clustering
    is an unsupervised method for identifying sets of natural cases based on one attribute
    set. This method groups data that have similar characteristics. One example is
    in [11, 12], where the k-means algorithm was used to group pothole types on roads
    based on data from a sensor device. Association analysis or association rule mining
    is a data mining technique to find rules for combinations of items that occur
    together. In the business world, it is often referred to as affinity analysis
    or shopping basket analysis. In [13], the authors utilized the Apriori algorithm
    to improve the efficiency of parallel computing on data generated by online education.
    The authors studied and analyzed the characteristics of education and big data,
    then collected and processed data regarding the frequency of course visits by
    users. The results showed that the accuracy of extracting association rules was
    improved and also helped school decision making in teaching management and education
    by providing instructive information. Classification is a procedure to discover
    one function to describe one class for a specific purpose. In other words, it
    is a process to find common characteristic definitions within a group or a class.
    An absolute classification has to show the target attribute or class [14]. In
    data mining, classification is one of the most common methods to be implemented.
    This method aims to estimate an object’s class that is previously unknown. Decision
    tree is one of classification methods that produces result like a tree. It decomposes
    complex problems into simpler ones to help decision makers solve problems [15].
    This method transforms data into decision rules and decision trees. In the tree,
    a leaf node corresponds to a class, a branch represents a test output, and an
    internal node corresponds to a test attribute. In [16], the authors used the Iterative
    Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm—a decision tree algorithm—for predicting swimming
    pools’ water quality. Their simulation results using Weka achieved 100% accuracy.
    Another example is in [17], where ID3’s classification results were used to support
    future investment decision making based on analysis of market and current financial
    situation. C4.5 is a well-known algorithm in data mining that is utilized for
    classification. It is utilized to examine data to find relationships between input
    variables or standard attributes and target variables or decision attributes.
    In C4.5, decision trees are built from data exploration results. For example in
    [18, 19], the C4.5 algorithm was utilized to count how many vehicles in a parking
    lot. In this case, C4.5 was implemented to distinguish detected moving objects
    as either people, cars, or motorcycles. Sensor devices were deployed at parking
    gates to collect sensor data. Each sensor device was built using an MPU-9266 accelerometer,
    an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a NodeMCU ESP8266. Another example is [20],
    where C4.5 was used to forecast soil quality using soil composition as training
    data. The experimental results supported precision fertilization and improved
    the accuracy of forecasting. Then, the works in [21, 22] used C4.5 for finding
    the relationship history of diseases to identify diseases. Furthermore, in [23],
    the authors used C4.5 to determine debtors’ eligibility based on 1000 records,
    including 30% rejected clients and 70% approved clients. The results showed that
    C4.5 had the highest precision (78.0%) and the highest recall rate (96.4%). In
    addition, C4.5 was also used to classify provinces based on dropout rates, where
    the results showed 71.2% accuracy [24]. 3 System Design The systems described
    in this article are IoT-based monitoring and recommendation systems. The design
    of the systems is shown in Fig. 1. In a monitoring system, there is a sensor device—with
    one or more sensors and Wi-Fi capability—that periodically senses nearby physical
    phenomena and sends the gathered data wirelessly through a Wi-Fi router. A web
    application utilizes C4.5 to process the received data and saves the data to a
    database. Users can get notifications regarding the monitoring conditions via
    this web application as well. The design of sensor devices for aquarium monitoring
    and ornamental plant monitoring will be discussed in Sects. 5 and 6, respectively.
    Fig. 1 The wireless monitoring system Full size image Figure 2 shows a flowchart
    for the program that runs on the sensor device. Arduino IDE is used to develop
    this program. Firstly, the program initializes the sensor device. Secondly, it
    checks for the availability of the Internet connection. If the device is connected
    to the Internet, sensors attached to the device start to sense and get data. The
    data are then sent for further processing through the Internet. These processes
    at the sensor device are repeated at a predefined interval. Fig. 2 Flowchart for
    sensor device Full size image Figure 3 shows a flowchart for the web application
    developed using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). This is basically the C4.5 algorithm
    that will be explained in Sect. 4. The input to the algorithm is the data training.
    First, C4.5 calculates the total entropy. Then, it calculates entropy and gain
    for every attribute. After that, it finds the highest gain and creates the root
    node. A decision tree is the output of the algorithm. In addition, after the rules
    are created, the list of rules also becomes the output. Fig. 3 Flowchart for web
    application Full size image 4 Classification Method Classification is a process
    of finding the same characteristic in a set of objects and grouping them into
    several categories based on the chosen classification model. The objective of
    classification is to discover a model from a set of training data that classifies
    attributes into the correct classes or categories. Then, the model is utilized
    to classify other attributes whose class has not been known yet. This is called
    the testing data. There are several classification techniques, one of which is
    decision tree. Decision tree is a popular method for prediction and classification
    in data mining. This method has a relatively fast development, that is, by converting
    a large amount of facts into a decision tree that corresponds to some rules in
    order for human to understand them easily. The decision trees are used for data
    exploration and for discovering unseen relationships between target variables
    and a number of potential input variables because the decision trees combine modeling
    and data exploration. A decision tree is a structure that applies a set of decision
    rules to split a large data set into smaller record sets. With each division set,
    the result set’s members are similar to each other. As a decision tree algorithm,
    C4.5 needs a training data set and testing data as its input. The training data
    are sample data that are utilized to construct a tree that has a class or label
    and has been tested for truth. The testing data are data fields that will be used
    as parameters in performing data classification. C4.5 is the evolution of ID3
    (Iterative Dichotomiser 3). The C4.5 improvements include the ability to handle
    missing values, continuous data, and pruning. C4.5 works as follows to build a
    decision tree. It firstly chooses the root from an attribute. Then it creates
    a branch for every value and splits cases into branches. This process is repeated
    for every branch until all cases in a branch have the same class. To select the
    root from an attribute, it takes the highest gain value of the existing attributes.
    The formula to calculate entropy is given in Eq. 1, where \\(P_i\\) is the number
    of the sample proportions for class i. Equation 2 is the formula to calculate
    gain is, where S is the number of sample data, x denotes an attribute, n is the
    number of partitions from S, \\(|S_i|\\) is the number of cases in i partition,
    and \\(|S|\\) is the number of cases in S. $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} {}
    \\mbox{Entropy}(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}-P_i \\times \\mbox{log}_2(P_i) \\end{aligned}
    $$ (1) $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} {} \\mbox{Gain}(S, X) = \\mbox{Entropy}(S)
    -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{|S_i|}{|S|} \\times \\mbox{Entropy}(S_i) \\end{aligned}
    $$ (2) In addition, information gain is one of the attribute selection measures
    that is utilized to choose the test attribute for every node in a tree. The attribute
    with the highest information gain is selected as a node’s test attribute. In the
    process of calculating gain, it is possible to have a missing value. After using
    C4.5 for classification, a multi-class confusion matrix is used to measure the
    level of accuracy obtained. A positive value where the actual class result and
    the classification class result are the same is True Positive (TP). False Positive
    (FP) refers to a negative value whose classification result is positive. True
    Negative (TN) refers to a negative value that has the correct class from the classification
    results, and False Negative (FN) refers to a positive value that is incorrectly
    classified as a negative value. $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} {} \\mbox{Accuracy}
    = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \\end{aligned} $$ (3) $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned}
    {} \\mbox{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\end{aligned} $$ (4) $$\\displaystyle
    \\begin{aligned} {} \\mbox{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\end{aligned} $$ (5)
    Accuracy is a measure of the level of closeness of the analysis results compared
    to the actual content. This shows the fraction of the total sample that is correctly
    classified by C4.5. The formula to calculate accuracy is Eq. 3. The proportion
    of relevant instances between retrieved instances is called precision. In other
    words, precision is the percentage of positive predictions that are absolutely
    correct. The formula to calculate precision is shown in Eq. 4. Recall refers to
    a fraction of the total number of relevant samples actually collected or as a
    sensitivity. The formula to calculate recall is Eq. 5. 5 Aquarium Monitoring 5.1
    The Sensor Device Figure 4 illustrates the sensor device’s design for the aquarium
    monitoring system. The device is built with an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), a
    turbidity sensor (TS-300B), a temperature sensor (DS18B20), a NodeMCU ESP8266,
    and a power supply. The power pins of NodeMCU and the three sensors are connected,
    as well as the ground pins. The data pin of the temperature sensor and both the
    echo and trigger pins of the ultrasonic sensor are connected to the digital pins
    of NodeMCU. A 4.7k Ohm resistor is also added between the temperature sensor’s
    power and data pins to stabilize the data transfer. The turbidity sensor has analog
    output, so its output pin is connected to the analog pin of NodeMCU. Table 1 shows
    the pin configuration for the aquarium’s sensor device. Fig. 4 Hardware design
    for aquarium’s sensor device Full size image Table 1 Pin configuration for aquarium’s
    sensor device Full size table 5.2 System Implementation and Evaluation The aquarium
    monitoring system is divided into two parts: a sensor device for collecting data
    and a web application for processing the data. The sensor device obtains data
    from an aquarium by using temperature, turbidity, and ultrasonic sensors. While
    the turbidity and temperature sensors are immersed in water, the ultrasonic sensor
    is mounted on top of the aquarium as shown in Fig. 5. The ultrasonic sensor reports
    water level by measuring its closeness to the water surface. The device uses NodeMCU
    to send the data via the Internet. When the data are received by the application,
    they are stored in a database. Then, C4.5 is used to analyze the data by building
    a decision tree, where the attributes are based on the acquired sensor data. The
    values in Table 2 are used to decide categories from sensor data for each attribute.
    Fig. 5 Hardware implementation for aquarium’s sensor device Full size image Table
    2 Categories for aquarium’s sensor data Full size table For evaluation purposes,
    there are 455 data records as training data, which are divided into two classes,
    that is, normal and change water, as shown in Table 3. The training data were
    gathered with a 30-minute interval for around ten days. The labeling of the training
    data obtained from the sensor device was done according to a person’s experience
    and observation in keeping the aquarium in a clean condition. In this experiment,
    the aquarium water was changed every two or three days. Hence, the number of training
    data that belongs to the normal class was greater than the change water class.
    Table 3 Training data for aquarium Full size table The classification algorithm
    for the aquarium monitoring system is implemented in a web-based application.
    Figure 6 shows the web application’s interface that informs the recent state of
    aquarium water according to the classification results, which are formed using
    C4.5. In this evaluation, confusion matrix is used to measure the performance
    of C4.5 based on the collected training data. Fig. 6 Web application’s interface
    for the aquarium monitoring system Full size image There are three kinds of partitions
    to separate the training data, that is, 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20. Figure 7 shows
    the performance comparison results for accuracy, recall, and precision from these
    three partitions. The 80:20 data partition achieves the highest recall, precision,
    and accuracy, with 97.8% accuracy. The lowest of them all is the 70:30 data partition,
    with 96% accuracy. The 60:40 data partition’s accuracy is approximately 0.2% higher
    than that of the 70:30 data partition as the training data are dominated by the
    normal class. The percentage of data with the normal class in the 60:40 data partition
    is much lower than in the 70:30 data partition. Fig. 7 Performance comparison
    of training data for the aquarium monitoring system Full size image Figures 8,
    9, and 10 show the analysis results for the training data with 60:40, 70:30, and
    80:20 partitions, respectively. These include the recall, precision, accuracy,
    and F1-Score values of each class. Figure 11 presents the rules for aquarium water
    according to classification results, which is formed using the C4.5 algorithm.

    Device The hardware design for the ornamental plant monitoring system is depicted
    in Fig. 12. The sensor device is equipped with a soil pH sensor, a temperature
    sensor (DHT11), a soil moisture sensor (YL-69), a NodeMCU ESP8266, and an Arduino
    Uno. NodeMCU is connected directly to the soil pH sensor and the temperature sensor.
    NodeMCU has only one analog pin, so Arduino Uno is utilized to provide additional
    analog pin to connect the soil moisture sensor. The pin configuration for the
    ornamental plant’s sensor device is shown in Table 4. Fig. 12 Hardware design
    for ornamental plant’s sensor device Full size image Table 4 Pin configuration
    for ornamental plant’s sensor device Full size table 6.2 System Implementation
    and Evaluation Similar to the aquarium monitoring system, the system for monitoring
    ornamental plant also consists of two parts: a sensor device for collecting data
    and a web application for processing the data. The sensor device is inserted into
    a plant pot as shown in Fig. 13. It gets air temperature and humidity data from
    the temperature sensor, pH data from the soil pH sensor, and soil moisture data
    from the soil moisture sensor. The data are transmitted by NodeMCU, received by
    the application, stored in a database, and analyzed by the C4.5 algorithm to give
    recommendation for the plant. The values in Table 5 are used to decide categories
    from sensor data for each attribute. Fig. 13 Hardware implementation for ornamental
    plant’s sensor device Full size image Table 5 Categories for ornamental plant’s
    sensor data Full size table In the evaluation, the training data consists of 524
    data records, which are divided into three classes, namely normal, need water,
    and need fertilizer, as shown in Table 6. The data were collected every 15 minutes
    for around six days. The training data were labelled based on a person’s treatment
    for the plant. While most data were labelled as normal, some of them were labelled
    as need water when the plant was watered twice a day, and need fertilizer when
    fertilizer was applied once during this experiment. Therefore, the number of training
    data that belongs to the normal class was greater than both the need water class
    and the need fertilizer class. Table 6 Training data for ornamental plant Full
    size table The experimental results for the ornamental plants monitoring system
    in a web-based application are given in the following. Figures 14 and 15 show
    the web application’s interface that gives information about the state of ornamental
    plants according to classification performed using C4.5. Fig. 14 Normal condition

    confusion matrix is implemented to measure the performance of C4.5 based on the
    training data, which are split into the 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20 partitions. Figure
    16 presents the performance comparison results of recall, precision, and accuracy
    for each training data partition. The 80:20 partition has the highest values of
    precision, recall, and accuracy, with 89.68% accuracy. Meanwhile, the 60:40 partition

    and Future Work The proposed article presents the design and implementation of
    two kinds of sensor devices for two IoT monitoring systems, that is, for aquarium
    and ornamental plants. The aquarium sensor device has three sensors—ultrasonic,
    temperature, and turbidity—connected to a NodeMCU. The ornamental plant sensor
    device has temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH sensors, as well as a NodeMCU
    and an Arduino Uno. The sensed data are sent from the sensor devices to the web
    applications to be analyzed using C4.5 to classify the monitored objects’ conditions.
    The recommendation given by the system for an aquarium based on its condition
    is either normal or change water. While for an ornamental plant is either normal,
    need water, or need fertilizer. In the experiment, the performance of training
    data for the aquarium monitoring system achieves 97.8% accuracy, while the ornamental
    plant monitoring system achieves 89.68% accuracy. To improve the systems, one
    can modify the hardware by adding different sensors. For example, a TDS sensor
    to sense total dissolved solids in water and a pH sensor to sense water pH level
    may be useful for the aquarium monitoring and recommendation system. For the ornamental
    plant, an electrochemical sensor to detect soil nutrient and a leaf humidity and
    temperature sensor to detect humidity and temperature on leaf surface may also
    be beneficial. As for the software, one can implement other classification algorithms
    and compare the results to see if they have better accuracy than the C4.5 algorithm.
    In addition, having some kind of notifications sent to WhatsApp or Telegram if
    the objects need attention is better than having them displayed only on the web
    applications. The last but not the least is having actuators to take care of the
    objects automatically. References Y. Yang, X. Chen, R. Tan, Y. Xiao, IoT technologies

    of Things-Based Hardware and Software for Smart Agriculture: A Review Chapter
    © 2020 Introduction According to a survey, it is predicted that Global population
    will increase approximately upto 9.73 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100
    [1]. A rise in the demand for agriculture food production increases in direct
    proportion to population expansion [2]. Food production always hampers due to
    various environmental issues including climate change and harsh weather conditions
    [3, 4]. Climate change has a significant negative impact on agriculture due to
    rising water demands and decreasing agricultural productivity in areas that require
    the only irrigation [5]. Irrigation technologies based on rain-fed agriculture
    and groundwater irrigation are required to grow better crops. A diverse irrigation
    system for managing water, as well as agricultural field monitoring systems, are
    required in precision agriculture crop fields (e.g., wheat, potato, and onion),
    where each crop has particular water requirements and agriculture crop field protection.
    Apart from water management and agricultural field monitoring systems, transferring
    important information to farmers is essential to supervise and control the ongoing
    activities without go to the field in real-time. Researchers in [6, 7], have considered
    only the monitoring of soil moisture and environmental conditions but do not handle
    with field monitoring system in agriculture field from remotely and easily without
    farmer-field direct contact. Farmers may lack the ability to employ the existing
    technologies. It plays an important role in changing traditional and new technology
    from homes to offices and everywhere in between. So an easy and simple way out
    is very attractive from the farmer’s perspective. The most pressing issues, such
    as dwindling water supplies and environmental concerns, necessitate a smart agriculture-based
    solution. A remote sensor network (WSN) is connected to IoT which can be used
    for a smart water system framework. Thus, employing WSN can provides a way for
    correspondence, calculation, and data detection from nearby and remote locations.
    The IoT and sensor network innovation collaborate with the board of water assets
    for the framework of a water-saving system. In this system, the moisture sensor
    detects the amount of water in soil, a water siphon supplies the essential amount
    of water to plants, and a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) block transmits observed data
    to internet [8, 9]. Then IoT framework has developed, tested, and approved by
    observing the different parameters of commercial agriculture farming [10]. In
    this sector, by employing smart farming via IoT can be able to improve operational
    efficiency, lower costs, reduce waste, and better product quality. In order to
    increase the profits, the agriculture sector will need to incorporate new technologies.
    In this sector, the high labor cost of routine manual monitoring must be reduced.
    It should be crucial to properly manage water when it is not in use. Recent studies
    have emphasized the need of smart agriculture in enhancing and growing agricultural
    output to help close the food supply–demand gap. An efficient and economical smart
    gadget is very important for precision agriculture system to maximize agricultural
    farm product, anticipate crop health, and protect crops from animals and fire.
    To resolve these issues, we have proposed a device namely SmartTech-Agri for soil
    and agriculture field monitoring systems well-being checking framework for improved
    yield of the harvests, particularly in rural regions where internet is available.
    The major contributions of our research work are as listed below: i. Design a
    real-time smart device for agriculture crop fields using IoT to measure and monitor
    the health condition of soil as well as condition of environment. ii. Proposed
    device is also responsible for safety and protection of agricultural field especially
    in firing condition, and attacking of birds and animals. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The Sect. 2 discusses the related existing works. Architecture
    of proposed design is given in Sect. 3. The flowchart and working procedure are
    presented in Sect. 4. The detail design of proposed work is presented in Sect
    5. Implementation of our proposed designs is described in Sect. 6. Details observation
    of our proposed designs is explained in Sect. 7. In Sect. 8, the paper is concluded.
    Related Works In this section, different existing related works are discussed
    briefly. The wireless sensor network (WSNs) with the AgriSens architecture consists
    of various parts like water-level sensor, sensor node, remote server, and IoT
    gateway [6, 11, 12]. Adopting a WSN is anticipated to address both system-level
    concerns and end user needs for effective agricultural monitoring. It is difficult
    to compare all of these topologies because several WSN topologies have been built,
    and each topology has its own scenario [13]. A conceptual architecture based on
    WSN namely FarmFox architecture is described in [7], which is cost-effectiveness,
    user friendly, versatile, energy competence, reliability, and hardiness. In [14],
    a low-cost agro-climatic monitoring system based on the IoTs is made up of a number
    of stations placed both inside and outside the greenhouse and connected to an
    IoT platform via a WSN. Each station is equipped with a variety of sensors to
    detect many variables including humidity, temperature, soil moisture, wind direction,
    wind speed, precipitation, pH, radiation, etc. [14]. Precision farming with IoT
    technologies like AgriTalk does for the cultivation of turmeric which improved
    the quality dramatically [15]. A low-cost, highly accessible IoT platform for
    agriculture is introduced namely FarmBeats [16] which utilizes TV White Spaces
    (TVWS), long-range technique that supports high bandwidth sensors. This FarmBeats
    employs an intelligent Gateway and a weather aware base station to make sure that
    services are accessible both online and offline. There are also new path-planning
    algorithms that help to extend the battery life of drones [16]. Small amounts
    of water and electricity can be used to cultivate healthy plants. The authors
    in [17] primarily focus on cultivating tomato plants, which were successfully
    cultivated using an IoT-based automated approach. In this approach, a Node MCU
    is used to drive the DC motor and IoT technology is utilized to evaluate the different
    parameters such as soil moisture level, humidity level, temperature, and rain
    status. These parameters are all transmitted through Wi-Fi to the smart phone
    [18]. A system is designed that could automatically adjust the humidity and temperature
    of a confined environment and VLSI systems can be used to achieve inexpensive
    automation [19]. The design in [20] is an agricultural embedded system based on
    CMOS technology and it is used to implement the FPGA board [20]. With data monitoring
    utilizing LoRa and IoT Technology for smart farming, this effort is reviewed in
    real-time, with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture regularly communicated
    to the cloud with better data quality (QoD) [21]. In order to prevent animal invasions
    into crop fields, the authors describe the creation of a WSN application for crop
    safety. The nodes in the agricultural field have RF modules, LED flashers, PIR
    sensors, and sound generators. An intrusion detection system is installed to allow
    for early identification of the animal in the field [22]. In [23], an automatic
    irrigation system is used to manage and track irrigation. For precise field monitoring
    and control, two different types of sensors are employed. The PIC microcontroller
    serves as the project’s brains for automatic irrigation and the PIC’s internal
    ports are attached to the moisture and touch sensors [23]. The authors of [24]
    suggest an IoT-based smart stick that will enable ranchers to have real-time information
    about soil moisture and climate temperature for a very low-cost, allowing for
    live monitoring. The study in [25] shows the detail design and construction of
    a system that tracks humidity, temperature, and soil moisture at the agriculture
    field level. An IoT scheme in horticulture is made up of electronic devices that
    supervise the condition of air, water, and soil [26]. Architecture of Proposed
    “SmartTech-Agri” The architecture of SmartTech-Agri is briefly illustrated in
    Fig. 1. In our proposed device, we have employed the traditional conceptual architecture
    of WSN which is based on the architecture of IoT. Fig.1 Architecture of proposed
    SmartTech_Agri Full size image The proposed SmartTech_Agri is combined with three
    layers which are discussed in the following. (a) Sensing and Data Actuating Layer
    Wi-Fi technology is used by sensor nodes in the field to collect data about the
    field’s properties and transmit it to IoT gateway nodes. The data are then sent
    as packets by the gateway nodes to the distant server. In order to facilitate
    the integration and interconnection of virtual and physical entities, Wi-Fi produces
    the fundamental IoT-based communication architecture. (b) Remote Processing Layer
    It is the middle layer between the bottom layer and upper layer. Smart technology
    organization processes requests as well as data from the top and bottom layer.
    The advantage of being able to oversee field operations from a distance is made
    possible by the remote processing layer. (c) Application Layer The farmers may
    easily utilize the analytics to visualize the data that has been collected on
    their smart phones and personnel computers (PCs) with the aid of an internet and
    Wi-Fi connection. The farmers can locate a specific node’s position. Additionally,
    farmers can view their field data at any time via the Web server utilizing the
    Internet. Through Wi-Fi and the internet, farmers can also manage field operations
    in accordance with requirements. In the next section, flowchart and working procedure
    are discussed. Proposed Flowchart of SmartTech-Agri The flowcharts of SmartTech-Agri
    for two different microcontroller units are given in Figs. 2 and 3. Figure 2 represents
    the flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri devices using UNO_R3_ATMEGA328P. The
    proposed design works as follows. Fig. 2 Flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri

    Devices using UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266 Full size image The steps of working
    procedure of Fig. 2 are represented as follows: 1. First set up pin mode. 2. Connect
    with serial port to ESP8266 with a baud rate of 115,200 bps. 3. Wait for smoke
    and motion signal (To calibrate the result keep smoke sensor in clear air and
    PIR sensor away from motion. LED will blink when it is calibrated.) 4. Collect
    sensor data one by one and send to ESP8266 via serial port with delay of 3 s.
    5. Repeat step 4. Figure 3 represents the flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri
    devices using UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266 and their working steps are shown
    in the following. 1. Set up pin modes buzzer will beep 2 times after this. 2.
    ESP8266 to connect with Blynk software, make sure Wi-Fi is ON, buzzer will beep
    2 times.) 3. Wait for data available in serial port. 4. Read the different data
    from serial port and pass the data for each type through Blynk. 5. Obtain sensor
    value from data and send to Blynk. 6. Repeat step 3. Design of SmartTech-Agri
    The details of proposed SmartTech-Agri have been presented here. Details of all
    sensors are also presented in this section. A. Block Diagram of SmartTech-Agri
    Device: Cost-effectiveness, energy economy, reliability, and resilience are the
    main concepts that drove us to build these nodes. (a) Integrated Design of the
    Sensors Four sensors that have been recalibrated and utilized to measure moisture,
    temperature, motion of birds or other animals, and fire detection. The PIR sensor
    detects intruders near the field, soil moisture sensors measure the percentage
    of moisture content of the soil and smoke sensor senses the smoke from fire. Figure
    4 displays the deployed block diagram in more detail. The basics of different
    sensors are briefly described in the following subsection. Fig. 4 Block diagram
    of SmartTech-Agri Full size image i. Moisture Sensor (REES52) The resistance of
    the fork-shaped moisture sensor probe varies with soil moisture content and operates
    as a variable resistor (similar to a potentiometer). Soil conductivity and resistivity
    improve as soil moisture content increases. We can determine the soil moisture
    content by measuring the output voltage generated by the sensor in accordance
    with the resistance. To get our threshold value, we will first take an analogue
    reading from absolutely moist soil. If the analog reading exceeds this value,
    we will notify the user to water the soil. ii. Smoke Sensor (MQ-2)The smoke sensor
    can be used to detect flammable gas leakage and smoke. All the measuring parameters
    of this sensor can be measured from the datasheet of MQ-2 [27]. It is shown that
    the clean air has Rs/R0 value of 9.8. We can determine the R0 value of fresh air
    using this ratio. By running the sensor in fresh air and applying the analogue
    voltage output of the sensor according to Eq. (1), we can determine the Rs_air
    value of fresh air by analyzing the circuit of the MQ-2 sensor. $$ Rs\\_{\\text{air}}
    = ((5.0 - {\\text{Analog Voltage}}) \\, /{\\text{ Analog Voltage}}) $$ (1) We
    can calculate the value of Rs_air of fresh air from the Rs/R0 ratio. Now the Rs_air
    and Rs/R0 will change in the presence of smoke, and since Ro is fixed, we can
    compare this information with the data sheet to estimate the smoke concentration.
    iii. Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DTH11) This is a low-cost digital temperature–humidity
    sensor which computes the temperature and humidity in soil and environment. This
    sensor consists of 3-pin. Its data sensor output pin is connected with microcontroller
    digital pin. iv. Motion Sensor (PIR) The motion sensor (PIR) detects the movement
    of a human or animal within a range of around 10 m across the sensor placed in
    the agriculture field. This PIR sensor is capable of detecting different infrared
    radiation levels. The majority of PIR sensors feature a 3-pin connector on the
    bottom or side. One pin will be utilized for ground, another for signal, and the
    last for power. Power levels of up to 5 V are normal. The PIR sensor’s output
    remains low until motion is detected. It takes some time for the PIR sensor to
    warm up and begin functioning properly. (b) Integrated Design of IoT Gateway It
    serves as a communication bridge by establishing connections between the sensors
    and other devices like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. using internet. In SmartTech-Agri,
    an IoT gateway is employed to pass data from field to the processing unit. To
    achieve the stated goal, Wi-Fi and TCP, two widely utilized protocols, are used.
    We have created a webpage for managing and keeping track of the sensors. Additionally,
    it aids in the sensor data retrieval. (c) Integrated Design of Remote Servers
    We have created a Web server as part of our design. The files that make up a website
    are kept on the Web server along with the web server software. The servers are
    kept in a cloud-based environment. The SmartTech-Agri system is a \"unique system
    for precision agriculture\" since it uses this server to monitor the soil health
    monitor, intruders close to the field, and a smoke sensor to identify the smoke
    emitted from the fire. (d) Integrated Design of Sensor Nodes In order to produce
    SmartTech-Agri, sensor nodes are organized in a waterproof design. The android
    application displays the different parameters like temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, smoke, and motion which can be programmed into a microcontroller. B.
    Circuit Diagram of SmartTech-Agri Device: We have used UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266.
    It is used to obtain the sensor nodes active sleep mode. The UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266
    microcontroller is low-cost compared to other commercial alternatives. The device’s
    reliability qualification findings show that the expected data retention failure
    rate is substantially less than 1PPM during a 20-year period in hostile atmospheric
    conditions [12]. Figure 5 shows the circuit diagram of our proposed SmartTech-Agri
    device. The connections between the various node components and the processor
    are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Circuit diagram of proposed SmartTech-Agri device
    Full size image Implementation of SmartTech-Agri After successful design of our
    proposed SmartTech-Agri device, we have to implement the prototype of our model.
    Experimental set up is shown in Fig. 6. It shows the SmartTech-Agri prototype
    of our proposed device which will monitor the different parameters of agricultural
    crop field. Fig. 6 Proto-type model of SmartTech-Agri device Full size image The
    humidity sensor, temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, smoke sensor, motion
    detection sensor, buzzer, LED, relay, and motor are all connected to the microcontroller
    UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266. These sensors detect numerous soil parameters,
    and a motor is then used to provide the soil with water. The power supply for
    this microcontroller is 5 V DC is required to operate it. Moisture sensor is measured
    the soil moisture content in agricultural soil; the temperature and humidity sensor
    is measured the temperature and humidity in environmental condition in agriculture
    field; Smoke detector is detected the smoke of fires; and the PIR sensor is detected
    animals crossing fields by detecting their movement. Wild animals become agitated
    when the buzzer is used, and they vacate the place. The UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266
    microcontroller contains a Wi-Fi module that enables access to upload data to
    the cloud. The cloud-based web server for IoT applications (Blynk), is a basically
    open source. It can be operated by supplying a username and a password; we have
    developed our own channel for IoT-based agricultural monitoring. We will submit
    data via the Blynk API so that we can observe the soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, smoke, and animal detection on the web with visualization on a Blynk
    platform. This device displays the various readings based on various parameters.
    The Status LED has started to glow; it can set the threshold by positioning the
    gas sensor close to the smoke or gas you want to detect. After that, it turns
    around till the LED turns off. This sensor detects upto ranges approximately 5
    m. Whereas, PIR sensors detect the distance ranges from around 25 cm to 20 m.
    If any animal or bird close to within the detection range then the LED will ON
    otherwise the LED will OFF. Table 1 represents the performance comparison of SmartTech-Agri
    device with existing work. Cost of the proposed device is approximately four thousand
    only. So our device is cheaper compare to all existing designs [6, 7]. Table 1

    Analysis Here, we have discussed the details of results obtained from our experiment
    setup. The snapshots are directly taken from our implemented project. Figure 7
    demonstrates how the hardware is examined for moisture, humidity, soil temperature,
    motion, and smoke. It also mentioned the actual values. Fig. 7 Visualization of
    sensed data displayed on user Web application Full size image Visualization of
    sensed data displayed on Android application is shown in Fig. 8 for our experiment
    set up. We have collected all the data at Balichak, West Bengal, Paschim Medinipur
    (latitude:22.360145 and longitude: 87.55689), during August–September, 2022. All
    the observations are shown in Table 2 for duration of 15 days. Fig. 8 Visualization
    of sensed data displayed on Smartphone Full size image Table 2 Data collected
    from various sensors Full size table The reading differences between the farm
    meter (thermo-hygrometer) and used sensors for the nearby weather node are observed
    in Table 3. The digital thermo-hygrometer and DHT11 have variation between − 2.66
    and 3.14% for temperature. It is observed that there is not much of an average
    temperature difference between the thermo-hygrometer and DHT11 sensor. The reason
    for the little variation is that DHT11 measures temperature in positive integers,
    which have a range of 0–50 °C. The DHT11 and digital thermo-hygrometer results
    have an average humidity variation between − 2.82 and 3.85%. Different humidity
    measurement ranges are the cause of the reading discrepancy between the sensor
    and digital thermo-hygrometer readings. So accuracy of our proposed device is
    nearly within an acceptable maximum tolerance level of ± 4%. Table 3 Data accuracy
    analysis Full size table Conclusion The IoT has been employed in agriculture to
    increase crop yields, enhance quality, and lower expenses. Hence, we have proposed
    an IoT-based SmartTech-Agri device to monitor the soil condition and field monitoring
    of precision agriculture. The proposed device is designed and employed in agricultural
    field. We have observed the real-time data from different sensors placed in agriculture
    field. Cost of SmartTech-Agri device is very low. Accuracy of the proposed device
    is upto the satisfaction level. If the farmers successfully employ this agricultural
    IoT-based solution, they will produce enough crops for the upcoming population’s
    rapid growth. The cloud sense data will likely be utilized in our future research
    to build the machine learning models for intelligently automated in precision
    agriculture. References Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

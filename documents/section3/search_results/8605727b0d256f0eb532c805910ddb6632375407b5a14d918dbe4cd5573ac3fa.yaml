    is utilized, it is difficult to run permanently on batteries because the battery
    capacity is not infinity. In addition, in the case of a large-scale field, a large

    IEEE Conference Location: Jeju Island, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction In
    recent years, in order to improve crop production and quality of agricultural
    operations and to reduce labor’s cost, an “agricultural remote monitoring system”
    for remotely observing the environmental condition of the farm and a “precision
    agriculture” that is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring
    and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops have been attracting
    a lot of attention. So far, the existing studies have proposed an agricultural
    remote monitoring systems using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and remote sensing
    using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). In the existing WSN-based system, the environmental
    information (e.g., temperature, humidity, illuminance) is collected from a large
    number of sensor nodes installed in the farm using a low-power wireless communications
    (e.g., ZigBee, LPWA). However, in these systems, even when the low-power wireless
    technology is utilized, it is difficult to run permanently on batteries because
    the battery capacity is not infinity. In addition, in the case of a large-scale
    field, a large number of intermediate nodes should be installed in the field,
    hence the installation and operation costs are high. On the other hand, a wireless
    power transfer technology is evolving and equipment which is capable of supplying
    power to places dozens of centimeters away has been available. In addition, UAVs
    that can fly stably for a long time and has a large loading capacity has appeared.
    Therefore, in this study, we propose and develop a wide-area sensing system for
    large-scale farms using UAV, a wireless power transfer technology, and an energy-saving
    short-range wireless communication system (i.e., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)).
    In the proposed system, the UAV flies autonomously to the location of sensor nodes
    that are widely installed in the large farm for collecting the sensor data. Here,
    the UAV is designed to supply the power to the sensor node to measure and send
    the environmental information using the wireless power transfer technology. The
    combination of the UAV and the wireless power transfer technology not only cover
    a wide area of several kilometers to dozens of kilometers but also eliminates
    the need for periodic battery replacement of the sensor node and reduces the cost
    of operating the system. SECTION II. Related Works and Objectives of Our Study
    A. WSN-based Remote Monitoring System for Agriculture Kassim and Patil have proposed
    and implemented a WSN system to remotely monitor temperature and humidity on the
    farm in real time [1] [2]. In addition, Fitriawan has evaluated performance (e.g.,
    packet loss rate, throughput) of ZigBeebased WSNs in various communication types
    (e.g., one-to-one, many-to-one, multi-hop) and environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor)
    [3] [4]. In these existing studies, a large number of intermediate nodes should
    be installed for constructing a wide area WSN system, which results in high installation
    and operation costs. Especially, it is difficult to construct a wide-area agricultural
    remote monitoring system that covers a range of a few kilometers to dozens of
    kilometers because the throughput decreases as the number of hops in the communication
    path increases. Furthermore, even if the low-power wireless technology such as
    ZigBee and LPWA is utilized, the battery of the sensor node should sometimes be
    replaced because the battery capacity is not infinity. B. UAV-based Remote Sensing
    System In the existing studies, the UAV has been used for supporting agriculture
    [5] [6] [7]. Katsigiannis have used multispectral and thermal cameras to take
    aerial photographs to observe the vegetation and the water stress [8]. In addition,
    Rokhmana have used a high-resolution camera to take and analyze photos of the
    field to understand farmland area and growth variability [9]. However, these studies
    focus on analyzing images using high-priced cameras, and there is no consideration
    for utilizing UAV to efficiently collect environmental information. C. Objectives
    of This Study Based on the problems described in the previous sections, this study
    develops a new sensor network system utilizing the UAV equipped with not only
    a camera but also an embedded system with a short-range wireless communication
    (BLE) and a wireless power transfer module. The BLE module is used to collect
    the environmental information related to crop growth from sensor nodes installed
    at multiple locations of a large farm. In addition, by using wireless power transfer
    technology, the sensor nodes installed on the farm can be run without a battery,
    which eliminates a cost for periodic battery replacement. SECTION III. Proposed
    System Overview of our proposed system is shown in Fig.1. A main component of
    the system is an embedded system which controls flight of a UAV and supports a
    BLE communication and a wireless power transfer, a stationary sensor node which
    collects environmental information (e.g., temperature, humidity, illumination)
    on the farm, and a server that manages and analyzes the data collected by the
    UAV. When the embedded system receives a flight command from a terminal owned
    by the administrator, it sends a control command including the location information
    of the stationary sensor nodes to the UAV. Then, the UAV flies to the location
    of the stationary sensor node, takes a picture of the growth condition of the
    crop on the farm, and lands on the ground near the stationary sensor node. After
    the stationary sensor node is activated by being supplied power from a power transmission
    substrate of the wireless power transfer module mounted on the embedded system,
    It transmits the measured sensor data to the UAV using BLE communication. After
    the UAV finishes acquiring sensor data from all sensor nodes, it returns to the
    start point of the flight and sends the collected sensor data and the image pictures
    to the server via HTTP communication through wireless LAN. The server manages
    and analyzes the data received from the UAV, and provides the visualized data
    to the browser of the smartphone, tablet, and PC browsers. Fig. 1. Overview of
    Proposed System Show All Table I UAV Specifications A. Device/Functional Structure
    of the Proposed System In the following sections, we explain device and functional
    structure of the main components of the proposed system: a UAV with an embedded
    system, a stationary sensor node and a server. 1) UAV with Embedded System Device
    configuration of the embedded system is shown in Fig.2 and the appearance of the
    UAV is shown in Fig.3. The proposed system uses 3D Robotics’s 3DR SoLo as a UAV,
    which is capable of stable flight based on GPS coordinate and can be controlled
    by receiving the commands from the embedded system through the wireless LAN. The
    main specifications of the UAV are shown in Teb.I. In addition, the embedded system
    on the UAV is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which is a single-board computer
    supporting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The UAV operates as an access point for a wireless
    LAN, and the embedded system connects to the UAV through the wireless LAN and
    controls the flight function of the UAV. This structure allows the embedded system
    to control the UAV even when the UAV flies away from the administrator beyond
    the limit of the communication distance of the wireless LAN. The embedded system
    is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Camera V2, an inexpensive camera module for capturing
    images of the lower part of the UAV, a HC-SR04 that is a ultrasonic sensor for
    accurately measuring the altitude of the UAV, and a MQS-1PXD-R1, power transmission
    substrate for supplying power to the stationary sensor nodes using wireless power
    transfer technology. 2) Stationary Sensor Node Device configuration of the stationary
    sensor node is shown in Fig.4 and the appearance is shown in Fig.5. The stationary
    sensor node installed on the farm is composed of a microcontroller supporting
    a BLE communication, Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express. The microcontroller is
    equipped with a temperature and humidity sensor, and an illuminance sensor. In
    addition, the stationary sensor node is connected with a power receiving substrate
    of the wireless power transfer module, and is activated by a power supply from
    the UAV. After activated by the UAV, it measures the sensor data, and sends the
    measured sensor data to the UAV using BLE communication. The packet format of
    the sensor data is shown in Teb.II. Fig. 2. Device Configuration of Embedded System
    Show All Fig. 3. Appearance of UAV Show All 3) Server In the proposed system,
    we use a standard PC server as the server. The server centrally manages data of
    the environmental information on the farm and the images of crops using MySQL,
    and analyzes the data and images received from the embedded system to estimate
    the crop growth and weather conditions. Furthermore, it executes the HTTP server
    to provide the visualized data to the browser of the smartphone, tablet device,
    and PC so that the administrator can easily understand the condition of the farm.
    B. Algorithm for Autonomous Flight 1) Sensor Data Collection Using Wireless Power
    Transfer In this proposed system, the UAV is controlled based on the GPS coordinate
    and the result of the analysis of the image captured by the camera connected to
    the UAV so that it can land correctly on the stationary sensor node. After that,
    by supplying electric power from the UAV to the stationary sensor node using the
    wireless power transfer technology, the stationary sensor node can be configured
    without a battery. Fig. 4. Device Configuration of Stationary Sensor Node Show
    All Fig. 5. Appearance of Stationary Sensor Node Show All The flight and data
    acquisition procedure of the UAV is shown in Fig.6. First of all, when the UAV
    with the embedded system receives a flight control command that includes coordinate
    of the stationary sensor nodes from the administrator, it flies and moves to the
    position just above the stationary sensor node based on the GPS coordinate. The
    accuracy of coordinate measured by the GPS of the UAV is about 2 meters, hence
    the distance between the UAV and the sensor node is within the range of the BLE
    communication if the UAV is landed simply based on the coordinate of the GPS.
    However, if the UAV is apart such a distance from the stationary sensor node,
    it cannot supply enough power to the stationary sensor node to activate the measurement
    and BLE communication functions. Therefore, the embedded system analyzes the images
    taken by the camera mounted on the lower part of the UAV and controls the UAV
    using the landing algorithm of feedback control (see Section III.B.2) so that
    the UAV can land just above the stationary sensor node. At this time, if the distance
    between the power transmission substrate in the UAV and the power receiving substrate
    connected to the stationary sensor node is sufficiently short, power is supplied
    from the UAV to the stationary sensor node. Table II Packet Format of Environmental
    Information Fig. 6. Procedure for Acquiring Sensor Data Show All 2) Feedback Control
    of UAV Using Image Analysis After arriving in the sky above the sensor node based
    on the GPS coordinate, if the embedded system detects the shape of the power receiving
    substrate in the image taken by the camera, the UAV horizontally moves so that
    the power receiving substrate appears at the central point of the image. This
    process is repeated while lowering the altitude of the UAV until the wireless
    power transfer can be started. If the embedded system cannot detect the power
    receiving substrate in the captured image, the UAV increases the altitude and
    takes the image again. The detection procedure of the power receiving substrate
    is described below. In this study, in order to make the detection easier, a 25cm
    × 25cm piece of red drawing paper is pasted on the surface of the power receiving
    substrate of the sensor node, and the power receiving substrate is detected by
    applying color extraction and rectangular extraction process to the original images.
    First, the embedded system uses the color extraction based on the HSV model to
    extract only pixels of a specific color from the image. Next, the embedded system
    executes the rectangular extraction process for the pixels that are extracted
    by the color extraction process and calculates the center coordinate of the power
    receiving substrate. An example of the extraction process is shown in Fig.7. Next,
    the embedded system calculates the horizontal movement distance between the UAV
    and the central point of the sensor node, and moves to the position just above
    the sensor node. The actual distance per pixel in the image varies with the altitude
    of the UAV as shown in Fig.8. Therefore, the embedded system calculates the actual
    distance per pixel from the angle of view of the camera and the altitude of the
    UAV, and then calculates the horizontal distance to the center coordinate of the
    power receiving substrate. Here, the current altitude can be measured using a
    barometric pressure sensor which is standardly installed on the UAV, but the sensor
    cannot accurately measure the altitude. Therefore, the ultrasonic sensor is used
    to measure the altitude after the altitude of the UAV reaches the measurement
    range of the ultrasonic sensor (i.e., 3 meters). After that, the UAV lowers the
    altitude and is moved to the direction of the stationary sensor node for the calculated
    distance. This process is repeated until the distance is close enough to supply
    power to the sensor node using the wireless power transfer. Fig. 7. Example of
    Extraction Process Show All Fig. 8. Relationship Between Distance and Number of
    Pixels Show All SECTION IV. Performance Evalulation of Wireless Power Transfer
    In this section, we conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the power supply
    performance of the wireless power transfer module used in this proposed system.
    A. Magnitude of Current Supplied by Wireless Power Transfer First, the magnitude
    of current supplied from the power transmission substrate to the power receiving
    substrate during wireless power transfer is investigated. In the proposed system,
    the power is supplied by the power transmission substrate with 1W/5V output when
    approaching the power receiving substrate of 40cm square. At this time, the amount
    of current supplied to the power receiving substrate is expected to vary depending
    on the distance between the substrates and the positional relationship. Therefore,
    the magnitude of current supplied in various positional relationships is measured.
    The experiment is conducted in a flat area in a room at Ritsumeikan University,
    where there is no metal around. In the experiment, the height of the power transmission
    substrate is fixed at 0, 2 and 4cm from the floor. The power transmission substrate
    is moved from the center of the power receiving substrate by every 1 cm in the
    lateral and diagonal directions as shown in Fig.9, and the magnitude of current
    supplied is measured at each point. Fig. 9. Evaluation of Wireless Power Transfer
    Module Show All Fig. 10. Evaluation of Wireless Power Transfer Module(lateral)
    Show All The results of the experiments when moving the power transmission substrate
    in the lateral and diagonal directions are shown in Figs.10 and 11, respectively.
    These figures show the relationship between the distance between the power transmission
    and receiving substrates and the magnitude of current. As shown in these figures,
    after the distance between the substrates increases beyond a certain distance,
    the magnitude of current supplied tends to decrease. In addition, the magnitude
    of current significantly decreases when the power transmission substrate passes
    near the edge of the receiving substrate (around 20cm in x-axis) because the coils
    are crowded around the periphery of the power receiving substrate and it is not
    possible to generate a stable induction current due to the positional relationship.
    By confirming the actual operation of the BLE module used in the proposed system,
    it is clarified that the module works fine within 31cm from the center of the
    power receiving substrate, except for the 20cm area mentioned above, when the
    height of the power transmission substrate is 2cm. Therefore, we can conclude
    that the UAV can provide sufficient power to the BLE module using the wireless
    power transfer by landing within an area of 62cm square. B. Packet Loss Rate during
    Wireless Power Transaction In this study, we prototype a stationary sensor node
    using the BLE module and evaluate the communication performance during wireless
    power transfer. This experiment is conducted in the ground at Ritsumeikan University.
    Fig. 11. Evaluation of Wireless Power Transfer Module(diagonal) Show All In this
    experiment, the stationary sensor node repeatedly transmits the packet of 20 bytes
    (maximum packet size of BLE) to the embedded system on the UAV 100 times during
    a wireless power transfer. This measurement is performed when the power transmission
    substrate is placed at various points within an area (i.e., 62cm square) where
    the wireless power transfer is successful. In the experiment, the embedded system
    can correctly receive all data packets with no data corruption or missing. Thus,
    it can be clarified that the wireless power transfer is useful to operate the
    stationary sensor node for collecting the environmental information. SECTION V.
    Performance Evalulation of Landing Control Algorithm In this section, we develop
    an embedded system installed on the UAV, and conduct a demonstration experiment
    to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed landing control algorithm. A. Detection
    Accuracy of the Stationary Sensor Node by Image Analysis In this experiment, We
    firstly evaluate detection accuracy of the power receiving substrate of the stationary
    sensor node by image analysis. This experiment is conducted in the ground at Ritsumeikan
    University, and the altitude of the UAV is raised at 5m intervals and 20 images
    are taken at each altitude. Then, the images are analyzed for detecting the shape
    of the power receiving substrate, and the detection accuracy is evaluated at each
    altitude. Figure 12 shows the relationship between the altitude of the UAV and
    the detection rate of the stationary sensor node. From this figure, the detection
    rate tends to decrease as the altitude of the UAV increases. In addition, the
    detection rate of sensor nodes is stable when the altitude of the UAV is lower
    or equal to 20 meters. However, when the altitude exceeds 25 meters, the accuracy
    markedly decreases because the different objects can be detected as the sensor
    nodes. Here, when the altitude of the UAV is 20 meters, the image taken by the
    camera module can capture an area of about 20 meters square. Therefore, even if
    the measurement error of the GPS coordinate is about 5 meters, it is possible
    to keep the stationary sensor node within the angle of view of the camera module
    by navigating the UAV based on the GPS coordinate. Fig. 12. Detection Accuracy
    of the Sensor Nodes Using Image Analysis Show All Fig. 13. Effectiveness of Feedback
    Control using Image Analysis Show All B. Landing Accuracy of Feedback Control
    Algorithm In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feedback control
    algorithm, we compare the performance between the proposed algorithm and the simple
    GPS-based navigation in terms of the distance between the landing point and the
    center point of the sensor node. In addition, we confirm whether the wireless
    power transfer succeeds a landing point in each algorithm. This experiment is
    conducted on the same ground as the previous sections. The sensor node is installed
    at a position 30 meters away from the takeoff point of the UAV, and the UAV is
    controlled by the embedded system to land near the sensor node. In this evaluation,
    ten trials are performed for each method and the distance between the power transmission
    substrate and the power receiving substrate at the landing point is measured.
    Figure 13 shows the box plot of the measured distance in each method. As shown
    in this figure, the proposed method achieves an accurate navigation of the UAV,
    and the UAV can land on the position where the wireless power transfer is succeeded
    (i.e., the distance is shorter than 31 cm) with high probability. As a result,
    the proposed method landed in a position where wireless power transfer could be
    successful 6 times out of 10 trials. In the future, the feedback algorithm will
    be enhanced so that the landing procedure is repeated until the UAV can receive
    sensor data after landing. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this study, we have proposed
    a new sensor network system that autonomously collects data related to crop growth
    from sensor nodes installed in multiple points scattered over a vast farm. For
    eliminating the need for periodic battery replacement of the sensor node and reduces
    the cost of operating the system, the UAV flies over a vast farm and the stationary
    sensor nodes are operated using wireless power transfer from the UAV. Through
    the experimental evaluation using the developed system, it has been confirmed
    that the UAV can accurately be controlled by the proposed feedback control to
    land near the sensor nodes, and that the sensor nodes can be operated by the wireless
    power transfer from the embedded system of the UAV. In the future, we will consider
    enhancement of the feedback control algorithm so that the wireless power transfer
    is always succeeded and will propose a method to estimate the crop growth by collecting
    and analyzing sensor data during the actual crop growth stage. I would like to
    thank Mr. Toshio Masuyama for his cooperation in the study of wireless power supply
    technology. This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H04103.

  description: In recent years, countries where agriculture is a major industry own
    vast tracts of farmland, and IoT system to improve the efficiency of farming operations
    on the vast farmland are attracting attention. In order to collect environmental
    information from anyway of the vast farmland, the construction of sensor networks
    using LPWA that enables long-distance communication has been attracting attention.
    However, many obstacles such as crops and agricultural machinery on the farm makes
    long-distance wireless communication difficult even when using the LPWA. In addition,
    even when the clear line of sight from the sensor nodes is ensured, the radio
    waves may interfere with each other, which makes the gateway impossible to receive
    the sensor data correctly.Therefore, in this research, we develop a sensor network
    system using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that can move freely in the sky.
    The UAV works as a gateway to collect the sensor data from the sensor nodes and
    move autonomously for searching the locations where they can maintain good communication
    property from sensor nodes dispersed over a wide area of a large farm. Furthermore,
    in order to improve the efficiency of the sensor data retrieval, the sensor nodes
    within the same area of the farm construct clusters and select one representative
    node in each cluster. In addition, in order to prevent radio interference caused
    by simultaneous data transmission, the sensor nodes are implements media access
    control mechanism for LPWA.

    farmland, the construction of sensor networks using LPWA that enables long-distance
    communication has been attracting attention. However, many obstacles such as crops
    and agricultural machinery on the farm makes long-distance wireless communication
    difficult even when using the LPWA. In addition, even when the clear line of sight
    from the sensor nodes is ensured, the radio waves may interfere with each other,
    which makes the gateway impossible to receive the sensor data correctly. Therefore,
    in this research, we develop a sensor network system using an Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) that can move freely in the sky. The UAV works as a gateway to collect
    the sensor data from the sensor nodes and move autonomously for searching the
    locations where they can maintain good communication property from sensor nodes
    dispersed over a wide area of a large farm. Furthermore, in order to improve the
    efficiency of the sensor data retrieval, the sensor nodes within the same area
    of the farm construct clusters and select one representative node in each cluster.
    In addition, in order to prevent radio interference caused by simultaneous data
    transmission, the sensor nodes are implements media access control mechanism for

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jeju Island, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction
    In recent years, countries where agriculture is a major industry (e.g., countries
    in Southeast Asia) own vast tracts of farmland, and especially, the farmland of
    Vietnam occupies more than one third of the total land area of the country. In
    these countries, IoT (Internet of Things) system to improve the efficiency of
    farming operations on the vast farmland are attracting attention. On the other
    hand, in order to collect environmental information related to the growth condition
    of crops from anyway of the vast farmland, the construction of sensor networks
    using LPWA (Low-Power Wide-Area) has been attracting attention. The LPWA enables
    long-distance communication with low power consumption because the frequency band
    with good propagation characteristics (920/429 MHz band) is used. However, it
    is difficult to maintain a clear line of sight between the gateway (i.e., the
    central point of the sensor networks) and the sensor nodes on farms where there
    are many obstacles such as crops and agricultural machinery, hence it makes long-distance
    wireless communication difficult even when using the LPWA. In addition, even when
    the clear line of sight from the sensor nodes is ensured, if a large number of
    sensor nodes transmit sensor data at a time of their choosing, the radio waves
    may interfere with each other, which makes the gateway impossible to receive the
    sensor data correctly. Therefore, in this study, we develop a sensor network system
    using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that can move freely in the sky. In the
    proposed system, the UAV works as a gateway to collect the sensor data from the
    sensor nodes and move autonomously for searching the locations where they can
    maintain good communication property from sensor nodes dispersed over a wide area
    of a large farm. In addition, the sensor node transmits the sensor data to the
    UAV through LoRa communication which is one type of the LPWA. In order to improve
    the efficiency of the sensor data retrieval, the sensor nodes within the same
    area of the farm construct clusters and select one representative node in each
    cluster. The representative node aggregates the environmental information received
    from the other nodes in the clusters and sends the aggregated information to the
    gateway (i.e., UAV). Furthermore, in order to prevent radio interference caused
    by simultaneous data transmission from the multiple sensor nodes, the TDMA (Time
    Division Multiple Access)-based media access control mechanism is adapted. In
    this mechanism, different time slots are assigned to the sensor nodes in the same
    cluster so as to transmit the environmental information to the representative
    node at a different timing. In addition, when choosing representative node in
    the cluster, the sensor nodes implements CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)based
    media access control mechanism. In this mechanism, each sensor node checks communication
    status of other nodes before starting the communication and autonomously decides
    an appropriate timing for exchanging the metric of deciding the representative
    node with others for preventing the interference. Furthermore, an error-correcting
    code is leveraged to correctly transmit the information between the sensor nodes
    and gateway even when the bit error occurs during the data transmission. SECTION
    II. Related Works and Objectives of Our Study A. Management System using LoRa
    Communication In the existing studies, the environmental observation systems utilizing
    LoRa for agriculture have been proposed so far. The objective of the existing
    system is to collect environmental information from sensor nodes installed on
    farms using LoRa communication [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]. In the reference of [2]
    [4] [5] [6], various kinds of sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.)
    are simultaneously measured inside the greenhouse and are transmitted to the base
    station using the LoRa communication to manage the condition of the farm. However,
    in these existing studies, the authors have not assumed a realistic condition
    where there are various types of obstacles (e.g., crops, agricultural machinery)
    which interfere with the long distance communication of LoRa. B. Localization
    System using Received Signal Strength In existing studies, an object localization
    system based on received signal strength is proposed [8] [9]. Especially, in our
    previous study, Andon et al. have proposed a system in which a UAV autonomously
    searches for a distressed person carrying a beacon transmitter (i.e., LoRa-supported
    device) in a mountainous area [10]. In this system, the UAV measures signal strength
    of the radio waves and estimates the direction of the distressed person who owns
    the beacon devices. Here, the authors have clarified that the fuselage of the
    UAV blocks radio waves and the received signal strength of radio waves arriving
    from a specific direction becomes large. However, the existing localization system
    of the previous study is focusing on only a single beacon device and does not
    search for an appropriate position where the communication quality to the multiple
    sensor nodes becomes good. C. Objectives of This Study This study proposes a farm
    management system that uses UAVs and LoRa communication for efficiently obtains
    the environmental information from a large number of sensor nodes deployed on
    the vast farm. In the proposed system, the UAV works as a gateway which collects
    the environmental information from the sensor nodes, and autonomously searches
    points where the gateway can achieve stable communications with multiple sensor
    nodes. In addition, the proposed system constructs clusters with nearby sensor
    nodes and chooses a representative node of each cluster. This mechanism can reduce
    the traveling distance of the UAV because the UAV needs to communicate with only
    the representative nodes for obtaining all environmental information of the farm.
    Furthermore, a Hamming code is utilized to correctly transmit the information
    between the sensor node and the gateway even when the bit error occurs during
    the data transmission. Fig. 1. Overview of the Proposed System Show All SECTION
    III. Proposed Farm Management System An overview of the proposed system is shown
    in Fig. 1. The proposed system consists of a sensor node equipped with a variety
    of sensors and a communication module (LoRa mini) capable of LoRa communication,
    an embedded system (Raspberry Pi 3) that controls the UAV and works as a gateway
    of the sensor nodes, and an analysis server that analyzes the environmental information
    collected by the UAV. The embedded system is attached to the UAV and supports
    the LoRa communication for receiving environmental information from the sensor
    nodes. In addition, the LoRa communication is utilized for finding an appropriate
    position at which stable communication to multiple sensor nodes is possible by
    measuring the received signal strength of the radio wave from the sensor node.
    A. Functional/Device Configuration of Proposed system The embedded system installed
    in the UAV has two modes: search mode and communication mode. In the search mode,
    the embedded system attempts to move to the position where the stable communication
    with the clusters of the sensor nodes based on the signal strength of radio waves
    received from the representative node of each cluster. In the communication mode,
    the embedded system attempts to collect all environmental information of the farm
    by communicating with the representative nodes of the clusters. The detailed procedure
    of the search and communication modes are described in Section III-C. The UAV
    used in this study is the 3D Robotics’s Solo which has a maximum payload of 450
    g, hence it is suitable for installation of the embedded system. The configuration
    of the UAV used in this study is shown in Fig. 2. The embedded system is connected
    to the UAV through Wi-Fi connection and controls the flight of UAV and works as
    a controller of the UAV so that the UAV is allowed to fly autonomously without
    being limited by the distance from the start point. The sensor nodes have the
    function of measuring environmental information and of transmitting the measured
    data to the gateway when receiving requests from embedded system on the UAV. In
    addition, the sensor nodes build the cluster by autonomously selecting the representative
    node from them. The device configuration of the sensor node is shown in Fig. 3.
    The sensor node in this study is mainly composed of the a LoRa-supported microcontroller,
    LoRa mini developed by Dragino. For obtaining the environmental information, a
    DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, a TSL2561 illuminance sensor and a 10HS soil
    moisture sensor are connected to the microcontroller. Fig. 2. Configuration of
    UAV Show All Fig. 3. Configuration of Sensor Node Show All Fig. 4. Network Structure
    of Proposed System Show All B. Communication Methods for Sensor Data using LoRa
    The network structure of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 4. In the proposed
    method, the UAV is the central point of the sensor network and communicates with
    only the representative node of each cluster consisting of the nearby sensor nodes.
    The representative node has the ability to collect measurement data from the other
    sensor nodes of the same cluster and transmits the collected data to the gateway
    when the UAV gets close to the cluster. In this section, data communication procedure
    among the sensor nodes and the gateway on the UAV is explained. The detailed procedure
    of the cluster configuration and media access control mechanism of the sensor
    nodes are explained in Section IV. After approaching to the cluster, the gateway
    (i.e., embedded system) on the UAV broadcasts the data collection request to the
    representative nodes within the communication range. The request packet includes
    a 1-byte in which the token (e.g., ID of the representative node) indicating the
    start of communication is recorded. After that, the sensor node sends the measured
    data to the gateway through the representative node. Fig. 5. Structure of Packet
    Show All Fig. 6. Overview of the Positioning Algorithm Show All The structure
    of the data packet sent from the sensor node is shown in Fig. 5. In the proposed
    system, the environmental information is represented in 16 bits and 6 bits of
    inspection bits are added to the packet for detecting and correcting the error
    in the packet based on Hamming code. For transmitting four kinds of environmental
    information (i.e., temperature, humidity, etc.), the data packet consists of the
    total of 11 bytes (88 bits). The gateway cannot only detect errors in the packet
    received from the sensor node, but also correct up to one-bit error by using Humming
    code with an even parity check. If the error can be detected but not be corrected,
    the gateway sends a retransmission request to the sensor node. After receiving
    the data packet, the environmental information is obtained by removing the inspection
    bits and is stored on the database managed locally by the gateway until the UAV
    returns to the start point. C. Positioning Algorithm of UAV for Communicating
    with Representative Nodes First, the farm manager sets up the observation area
    and flight path of the UAV to move around the management terminal (e.g., smartphone
    application). After that, while moving based on the flight path, the UAV searches
    for a location where it can communicate with one or more representative nodes
    of the clusters. The following part of this section explains the method of searching
    for an appropriate location for communicating with the representative nodes. Here,
    the proposed method assumes that the UAV can arrive at the position where it can
    receive the radio signal from the representative nodes by the guidance based on
    the GPS location information. The overview of the positioning algorithm of the
    UAV is shown in Fig. 6. The first step of the positioning algorithm is to exchange
    the beacon with the representative nodes to measure the received signal strength
    of the radio wave from each node. When arriving at the position where it can communicate
    with the representative nodes, the UAV rotates clockwise from the current direction
    of travel and acquires the strength of the received signal with the representative
    node at each 45-degree rotation. The angle with the strongest received signal
    strength from each node is estimated as the direction that the good communication
    with the node is capable. Fig. 7. The Approach Algorithm of Multiple Node Show
    All Fig. 8. Example of TDMA-based Data Collection Show All The overview of the
    proposed approach for considering multiple representative nodes is shown in the
    Fig. 7. If there is only one representative node in the vicinity, it moves 10
    meters to the direction in which the node is presumed to be present. On the other
    hand, when there are multiple representative nodes in the vicinity, all nodes
    are set as the target and the UAV moves to the middle angle of the directions
    to the target nodes. The UAV repeats these processes until it is confirmed that
    it has been moved to the appropriate position. SECTION IV. Collecting Data From
    Clusters A. Data Collection from Multiple Sensor Nodes using TDMA A procedure
    example of the TDMA-based data collection from the sensor nodes is shown in Fig.
    8. A representative node obtains the environmental information from the sensor
    nodes in the cluster and transmits the aggregated information to the gateway on
    the UAV. Here, the representative node assigns a different time slot to the sensor
    nodes between each other by broadcasting a token packet and each sensor node sends
    its own environmental information to the representative node only at a timing
    of the assigned time slot in order to avoid collisions of the data transmission
    among nodes. The sensor nodes are assigned unique identifiers that are incremented
    one by one (i.e., 1, 2, 3, …) when constructing the cluster (see Section IV-B).
    When receiving the request packet from the representative node, the sensor node
    waits for ID×T [ms] before starting to send the environmental information to the
    representative node. T is a time interval of data transmission from the sensor
    nodes, so the representative node can complete to receive the information from
    all sensor nodes in N×T [ms], and N is the maximum number of sensor nodes that
    can coexist in the same cluster. Here, T should carefully be decided because the
    shorter T than the appropriate value may result in the occurrence of the collision
    but the longer T increases the data collection time. After the estimated waiting
    time (i.e., N×T [ms]) is passed, the representative node aggregates all the received
    information and transmits that to the gateway. Fig. 9. Example of CSMA Operation
    Show All B. Cluster Construction Method utilizing CSMA-based Data Exchange For
    constructing the cluster of the sensor nodes, the representative node needs to
    be determined. Here, in order to decrease the flight distance of the UAV, the
    sensor node which is the closest to the start point of the UAV is selected as
    the representative node. Therefore, the square of the distance between the start
    point and the sensor node is used as an evaluation value and the sensor node with
    the smallest value is selected as the representative node. For selecting the representative
    node, the sensor nodes in the cluster exchange the evaluation values among them.
    However, before selecting the representative node, the TDMA-based data transmission
    cannot be used for exchanging the evaluation value because there is no central
    point (i.e., representative node) which assigns a time slot to the sensor nodes
    and makes them to start sending the data. Therefore, the exchange of the evaluation
    value is based on the CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)-based technique. A
    behavior example of the CSMA-based data exchange is shown in Fig. 9. First, each
    sensor node confirms whether other sensor nodes are transmitting the evaluation
    value or not by confirming the status of the data reception of LoRa. If any other
    sensor node is not communicating, the sensor node starts to broadcast its evaluation
    values to the cluster (e.g., Cases of Node:A and Node:B in Fig. 9). On the contrary,
    if other nodes are communicating, the sensor node waits for the time interval
    determined by random numbers (e.g., Case of Node:C in Fig. 9). After the time
    interval is passed, it checks the reception status again. Each sensor node in
    the cluster waits for receiving the evaluation values from all other sensor nodes
    and compares its own evaluation value with that of other nodes. If its own evaluation
    value is the smallest in the cluster, the sensor node judges to be suitable for
    the representative node and broadcast the evaluation value again. If not receiving
    any response from other nodes within the predetermined timeout time, the sensor
    node starts to behave as the representative node in the cluster. Fig. 10. Example
    of Placement of the Sensor Nodes Show All SECTION V. Performance Evaluation A.
    Evaluation of Time Required for Receiving All Data and Packet Delivery Rate 1)
    Evaluation Setup: In order to evaluate effectiveness of our proposed data transmission
    methods, we prototype a sensor node supporting TDMA-based data collection method
    and CSMA-based cluster construction method. In this evaluation, we measure the
    packet loss rate for receiving the environmental information from all sensor nodes
    using TDMA, and that for exchanging the evaluation value among all sensor nodes.
    An example of the placement of the sensor nodes is shown in Fig. 10. Four sensor
    nodes are placed as shown in this figure, and one sensor node with red color is
    selected as the representative node. In this evaluation, we evaluate a packet
    loss rate during the data transmission between the sensor node that is selected
    as the representative node and the other nodes. In this experiment, each sensor
    node transmits packets 50 times and each packet includes data of 11 bytes by assuming
    environmental information. For the TDMA-based method, the time interval of each
    data transmission is set to 100ms, hence the representative node requires N×100[
    ms] for receiving packets from all sensor nodes in each data transmission. In
    addition, for CSMA-based method, the random number R for calculating the waiting
    time is selected from 0 to 30, hence the sensor node waits for R×35[ ms] when
    detecting the data transmission from other nodes. This experimental evaluation
    is performed at a ground in a campus of Ritsumeikan University. 2) Evaluation
    Result: Figure 11 shows the relationship between the number of sensor nodes and
    the packet loss rate when using each media access control method. As shown in
    this figure, the data transmission without using the media access control results
    in a large number of packet losses when multiple sensor nodes send the packets
    simultaneously. On the other hand, the CSMA-based method markedly decreases the
    number of packet losses compared with the method without using the media access
    control, and the TDMA-based method can avoid occurrence of the packet losses regardless
    of the number of sensor nodes. Based on the evaluation result mentioned above,
    we have decided to use the TDMA-based method for the representative node to collect
    all environmental information from the sensor nodes because the data transmission
    can avoid occurrence of the packet losses. On the other hand, the representative
    node has not been selected when the cluster of the sensor nodes is being constructed,
    hence the CSMA-based method is adopted for exchanging the evaluation value among
    the sensor nodes. Fig. 11. Number of Sensor Nodes vs. Packet Loss Rate Show All
    Fig. 12. Experimental Situation Show All B. Performance Evaluation of Autonomous
    Flight Algorithm 1) Evaluation Setup: This experimental evaluation is being conducted
    to evaluate the accuracy of the UAV’s movement to a position where the UAV can
    stably communicate with the representative nodes. In this evaluation, the UAV
    conducts ten trials of searching the position using the proposed autonomous flight
    algorithm, and the number of times that the UAV can correctly complete the search
    process and the time required to complete the search process are evaluated. In
    addition, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the simple
    existing algorithm that randomly selects the moving direction of the UAV and continues
    to move to the same direction until the received signal strength of the radio
    wave from the targets does not decrease. This experimental evaluation is performed
    at a playground in a campus of Ritsumeikan University. The experimental situation
    of the evaluation is shown in Fig. 12. In this evaluation, the representative
    nodes are installed at two locations in the ground, and the start point of the
    UAV with the embedded system is 60 meters away from the representative nodes.
    Here, when the distance between the UAV and the representative node is shorter
    than 25m, the signal strength become larger than -96dBm in this experiment. Therefore,
    we assume that the 25m is sufficiently close enough to stably communicate between
    the UAV and the representative nodes, and -96dBm is set to the threshold of the
    signal strength. When the average signal strength of the radio waves transmitted
    from the representative nodes and received by the embedded system exceeds the
    threshold, the system judges that it can approach the appropriate position where
    the communication with the representative nodes is stable and completes the search
    process. 2) Evaluation Result: The evaluation results of the proposed algorithm
    and the random flight algorithm are summarized in Teb. I and Teb. II. The “◯”
    in the table indicates that the average signal strength of received radio waves
    exceeds the indicates threshold that value the search and the is failed search
    because is completed, the UAV and could the “not ×” get close to the representative
    node due to dead of the battery. As shown in this table, the proposed algorithm
    can successfully complete the search process with higher accuracy than the simple
    algorithm. On the other hand, the random flight requires shorter time for detecting
    the appropriate position than the proposed algorithm when the search process is
    successfully completed because the random algorithm measures the signal strength
    of radio wave only once for deciding the flight direction. Figures 13 and 14 show
    examples of flight path of the proposed and random algorithms. As shown in these
    figures, the proposed algorithm always selects appropriate directions for approaching
    the representative nodes, but the random algorithm frequently selects wrong directions.
    Therefore, in the vast farm where the UAV can go straight for a long time once
    the direction of the flight is decided, the proposed algorithm may result in better
    performance in terms of the time required for detecting the suitable position
    than the random algorithm. Table I Flight Accuracy of Proposed Algorithm Table

    SECTION VI. Conclusions In this study, we have proposed a network system that
    can efficiently collect environmental information by moving the UAV with the function
    of the gateway to the location where communication with multiple sensor nodes
    becomes stable. In addition, we have proposed a new communication method of efficiently
    collecting data from the cluster of the sensor nodes with less radio interference.
    In the evaluation experiments, we evaluated the number of times the proposed autonomous
    flight algorithm was used to successfully approach a sensor node and the time
    required for the approach to the sensor node and showed the effectiveness of the
    proposed algorithm. In the future, we will consider a prediction method of future
    environmental information such as soil moisture on the farm based on the environmental
    information collected by the UAV. In addition, we will create a function to notify
    farm managers of feedback on the ingredients required for crops from the estimation
    results. Acknowledgement This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number

    of the standards used to implement industrial WSN, their advantages and drawbacks,
    and discusses the characteristics of the wireless channel in industrial environments.
    Finally, a systematic mapping is described, that presents results of publications
    about industrial WSN, and highlights important topics to be studied in this field.

    NetworksSurveySystematic mapping 1. Introduction Traditionally, industrial monitoring
    systems work offline or use wired networks to transmit the information to a central
    station. In monitoring systems based on wired networks, the installation process
    of cables and sensors usually has higher cost than the sensors themselves (Lu
    and Gungor, 2009). Moreover, this approach has limited flexibility, which makes
    the process of installation and maintenance of the network more difficult and
    expensive. An alternative to implement systems that present lower cost, is the
    use of wireless networks, which have significant advantages, including high flexibility,
    reconfigurability, easy installation and maintenance (Gungor and Hancke, 2009).
    More specifically, the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have other advantages, such
    as the ability of self-organization and local processing, appearing as a promising
    platform for the implementation of monitoring and controlling systems in industrial
    environments. The WSN nodes are equipped with sensors (or actuators), and present
    processing capabilities. They have resource constraints, with low processing power
    and, in some cases, restrictions in power consumption. In industry, sensors are
    deployed to monitor critical parameters such as vibration, temperature, pressure
    and motor efficiency (Delgado Gomes et al., 2013). The measurements obtained by
    the sensors are transmitted wirelessly to a sink node, which provides the information
    for analysis by a monitoring central, or to be used in control systems. In some
    cases, the acquired data is locally processed (at the end node) before transmission.
    A variety of information can be acquired by the WSN for different purposes, which
    allows taking appropriate decisions. Based on the obtained information, it is
    possible to fix or replace equipment before major losses occur. The use of WSN
    in industrial systems presents some challenges. Wireless networks use an inherently
    unreliable communication medium, which can be aggravated due to noise and interference
    in the spectrum band used for communication. Different types of interference sources
    for WSN can be found in industrial environments, such as welding equipment, microwave
    ovens, and other wireless communication devices (e.g. Wi-Fi or Bluetooth networks).
    In addition, in industrial environments there are machinery, and many metal objects
    and obstructions, as depicted in Fig. 1, which can affect the quality of the wireless
    channel. Thus, besides noise and interference, the communication channel is affected
    by heavy multipath propagation effects (Cheffena, 2012), which results in a high
    degree of attenuation in large and small scale (Tanghe et al., 2008). Download

    An example of industrial environment. Compared to other indoor and outdoor environments,
    the industrial ones are harsher due to the unpredictable variations of temperature,
    pressure, humidity, and so on. In addition, the wireless channel in many industries
    is non-stationary in the long term, which can cause abrupt changes in the characteristics
    of the channel over time (Agrawal et al., 2014). The lack of reliability makes
    it difficult to establish Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Since the industry
    intends to reduce the capital and operational expenditure without losing QoS (Kumar
    et al., 2014), the sensors need to be low cost, resulting in a set of restrictions,
    like low rate and low processing capabilities. Fig. 2 shows a general Industrial
    WSN (IWSN) configuration, in which the dashed arrows represent the wireless links
    of the End Nodes, and the solid arrows represent the links between the clustering
    nodes (Cluster Heads) and Sink Nodes. The Sink Nodes may have multiple wireless
    interfaces, each one using a different channel in order to allow simultaneous
    transmissions from the Cluster Heads. The End Nodes can communicate with a Sink
    Node using a single hop, or using multiple hops through a Cluster Head or intermediate
    routers (nodes illustrated in green). In this scenario, the intermediate routers
    are nodes that can act both as a sensoring device (end node), and as a router.
    The Final Processing Node is connected to the Sink Nodes, and is in charge of
    collecting and analyzing all the data received from the WSN. Usually the connection
    between the Sink Nodes and the Final Processing Node is done using a wired link.

    Fig. 2. General Wireless Sensor Networks. The characterization of the industrial
    environments, to analyze interference sources, and propagation characteristics,
    is an important step in the development of new applications that use wireless
    networks, and to improve the current standards used to implement IWSN, such as
    the standards WirelessHART (Song et al., 2008), ISA100.11a (Petersen and Carlsen,
    2011), WIA-PA (Silva and Guedes, 2014), and IEEE 802.15.4e (De Guglielmo et al.).
    Thus, experimental studies to analyze the performance of IWSN in real industrial
    environments can generate valuable information for the development of new techniques
    and protocols for IWSN. Fig. 3 shows the usual standards used to implement WSN.
    The ZigBee standard is not equipped to deal with multipath and interference problems
    in a satisfactory manner, since it does not implement any co-existence mechanism,
    and is based on the MAC protocol of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which uses Carrier
    Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) with single-channel communication.
    Thus, ZigBee is not recommended to implement IWSN (Song et al., 2008, Akerberg
    et al., 2011). Due to the limitations of MAC protocol defined by IEEE 802.15.4
    standard, new standards with a focus on industrial applications were proposed,
    such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and WIA-PA. They use the physical layer of IEEE
    802.15.4, but define different protocols for MAC layer that are based on Time
    Division Multiple Access (TDMA), channel hopping, or a combination of both mechanisms.
    Even defining mechanisms to deal with unreliability, these new protocols can face
    some problems. For example, when using channel hopping, the nodes usually switch
    to a new channel before each transmission. However, if a proper management of
    the blacklist is not made, the network performance can be significantly degraded
    (Grsu et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (216KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Standardization of low-power and resource-constrained
    wireless technologies. To overcome the limitations of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
    IEEE created in 2008 the 802.15 Task Group 4e (TG4e) (Association, 2017) for redesigning
    the existing 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. The goal was to define
    a low-power multi-hop MAC protocol, capable of addressing the emerging needs of
    industrial applications. This improvement resulted in the IEEE 802.15.4e MAC standard
    document (Association, 2017), released in 2012. This standard uses many ideas
    from WirelessHART and ISA-100.11.a standards, including slotted access, shared
    and dedicated slots, multi-channel communication, and frequency hopping. Specifically,
    IEEE 802.15.4e extends the previous IEEE 802.15.4 standard by introducing five
    new MAC behavior modes, designed to support specific application domains (De Guglielmo
    et al.). Among the five modes, only Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), Deterministic
    and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME), and Low Latency Deterministic
    Network (LLDN) modes have been explored in the literature, until now (De Guglielmo
    et al.). Besides the aforementioned standards, that focus mainly on the MAC layer,
    other standardization efforts have been done with focus on other aspects of the
    network. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined many protocols to
    integrate smart objects into the Internet, leading to the concept of Internet
    of Things (IoT). Some of the most important are IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal
    Area Network (6LoWPAN) (Montenegro et al., 2010), Routing Protocol for Low power
    and Lossy networks (RPL) (Ancillotti et al., 2013) and Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) (Al-Nidawi et al., 2015), that enables web applications on smart
    objects, and are depicted in Fig. 3. The concept of smart devices is closely linked
    to IoT, and Industrial IoT (IIoT) is the application of these technologies in
    industrial scenarios, such as in smart buildings, smart factories, and smart grids
    (Xu et al., 2014). It expands the traditional automation systems and industrial
    informatics systems into a much broader context (Yan et al., 2014). This survey
    has a focus on the lower layers of the WSN, however IoT topics is explored briefly
    in this survey. The literature presents a discussion about the use of a layered
    structure or a more flexible design, called cross-layer design (Karl and Willig,
    2005). In Hill and Culler (2002), the authors discuss examples in which cross-layer
    optimization is particularly useful in WSN. However, other authors (Kawadia and
    Kumar, 2005) argue that imprudent use of cross-layer designs can lead to feedback
    loops, endangering both functionality and performance of the entire system. Clearly,
    these concerns should be considered, and it is necessary to pay attention in order
    to avoid such unexpected feedback loops. Indeed, in general all WSN are implemented
    using some structured design, with physical, MAC and link layer protocols. That
    is why the characteristics of the layers and their respective main protocols are
    described in this survey. There is a number of papers that describe specific layers
    and their different protocols for IWSN, such as MAC layer (Bachir et al., 2010,
    Huang et al., 2013, Kabara and Calle, 2012, Khanafer et al., 2014, Suriyachai
    et al., 2012, Teng and Kim, 2010, Zhao et al., 2012), network layer (Routing)
    (Al-Karaki and Kamal, 2004, Pantazis et al., 2013, Ehsan and Hamdaoui, 2012, Tunca
    et al., 2014, Goyal and Tripathy, 2012, Patil and Biradar, 2012, Hao et al., 2012,
    Zanjireh and Larijani, 2015), and a few papers that focus on Transport Layer (Rathnayaka
    and Potdar, 2013, Obaidat and Misra, 2015). The physical layer is the same for
    all the standards usually used to implement IWSN (defined in the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard). The different standards define different MAC protocols, and some of
    them define protocols for the network and application layers. In this survey,
    the usual role of the five layers is discussed in Section 2, giving more focus
    on network, MAC and physical layers aspects. Some surveys for IWSN are available
    in literature, and an exhaustive list can be found in (Gungor and Hancke, 2009,
    Kumar et al., 2014, Wang and Jiang,, Bal, 2014, Zand et al., 2012, Christin et
    al., 2010, Baronti et al., 2007). In Gungor and Hancke (2009), the authors discuss
    the challenges of IWSN, radio technologies, and gives a brief overview of the
    standards. In Kumar et al. (2014), the IWSN standards are discussed, including
    the functions of Transport, Routing and MAC layers. The paper in Wang and Jiang
    has a focus on the most popular IWSN standards: ZigBee, WirelessHART, WIA-PA,
    and ISA100.11a. Their technical features, plus some security aspects are discussed.
    In Bal (2014), the author summarizes the literature and application examples of
    IWSN. The paper in Zand et al. (2012) provides an overview of the technologies
    in IWSN, the requirements of process automation and problems from the PHY layer.
    In Christin et al. (2010), the authors address QoS and Security aspects of industrial
    automation, and in Baronti et al. (2007), energy efficiency, networking, data
    management and security are mentioned, but not specifically focused in industrial
    environments. The objective of this survey is to provide a contemporary look at
    the current state of the art in IWSN, and discuss the still-open research issues.
    The main wireless standards used to implement IWSN, the communication layers,
    and the characteristics of wireless channels in industrial environments are discussed.
    In addition, this paper provides an insight on the various wireless motes and
    platforms available in the market, a discussion about Operating Systems (OS) for
    low-end devices, and about the network simulators that implement models for WSN.
    At the end of this survey, a systematic mapping is described, in order to provide
    an overview of the researches performed on the IWSN topic, which can help the
    researchers to identify important gaps in the existing approaches, as well as
    promising research directions. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently
    no systematic study providing a broad panorama about what has been investigated
    so far and what are the open issues about this subject. In comparison to the cited
    survey articles, the main contributions of the present survey are: • It provides
    a view on the WSN domain from an industrial perspective, and discusses the standards
    adapted to this environment; • It reviews the important aspects of the wireless
    channel in industrial environments, regarding path loss, multipath fading, shadowing,
    and interference problems; • It provides a detailed analyses on the two main layers
    that impact the reliability (PHY and MAC layers), and their protocols; • It presents
    the different motes commercially available, and for research purposes; • Reviews
    the OS and simulators designed for low-power wireless devices, and discusses a
    model adapted to simulate industrial environments; • It performs a systematic
    mapping that provides a background of IWSN in order to appropriately position
    new research activities, and to suggest areas for further investigation. The remainder
    of this survey is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the layers and protocols
    of a WSN, and the solutions that can be used to mitigate the communication problems
    in such environments. Section 3 introduces the standards used to implement IWSN,
    and their characteristics. The use of multiple channels and link quality estimation
    for WSN is discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, the platforms, operating systems,
    and simulators are discussed, giving special attention to the simulation of WSN
    in industrial environments. Section 6 describes a systematic mapping of the relevant
    papers on IWSN, and Section 7 discusses the main challenges of IWSN, and possible
    open issues. Finally, this survey is concluded in Section 8. 2. IWSN layers and
    protocols Using a top-down approach, this section discusses the layers and their
    main protocols that can be used to implement IWSN. The list is not intended to
    be exhaustive, but illustrative, since there are several papers that have already
    somehow discussed the most used protocols for WSN. The section begins with the
    application layer, and then go down to transport, network, MAC and physical layers,
    with a special attention to network, MAC and physical layers, discussing protocols
    suitable for IWSN, and to the characteristics of the wireless channels in industrial
    environments. 2.1. Application layer The application layer provides the designer
    with a high-level programming model for describing the system behavior. Industrial
    automation applications provide control, conservation, efficiency, and safety.
    They extend existing manufacturing and process control systems reliably, improve
    asset management by continuous monitoring of critical equipment, reduce energy
    costs through optimized manufacturing processes, and help to identify inefficient
    operation or poorly performing equipment (Sohraby et al., 2007). After solving
    synchronization, storage and complex channel requirements at lower layers, the
    communication at the application layer is reduced down to a basic message-passing
    and memory access primitives. This canonical set of primitives can then be further
    implemented on a given target communication architecture by the following layers
    of the communication stack (Gajski et al., 2009). Based on the specific requirements,
    IWSN applications can be classified into three groups (Erdelj et al., 2013): •
    Environmental sensing: covers the problems of air, water, material pollution,
    fire, flood or landslide monitoring, and hazardous environments; • Condition monitoring:
    covers the problems of structure and human condition monitoring (buildings, constructions,
    machine condition, and healthcare applications); • Process automation: covers
    information regarding the resources for the production and service provision,
    besides production performance monitoring, evaluation and improvements. In the
    application layer, one must define the reliability and latency requirements in
    order to correctly choose and configure the lower layer protocols to satisfy those
    defined by the application. Concerns such as the impact of the propagation environment,
    operation lifetime, heterogeneity of data collected, autonomous operation, maintainability,
    reliability, and security, are found usually in the other layers, and they are
    discussed in the next sections. The application deals indirectly with these problems.
    2.2. Transport layer The transport layer sits on top of the network layer, and
    together, they are responsible for transmitting messages between communication
    endpoints over the network of logical links and transducers. The goals of the
    transport protocols include congestion and flow control, fair allocation of bandwidth,
    reliability, packet-loss recovery, energy efficiency, and heterogeneous application
    support. There are several transport protocols in literature, and it is difficult
    to compare the performance of them, since each one was tested in different simulation
    environments, without a standard set of simulation/experimental settings. Hence,
    there is a number of classifications for the protocols. In Obaidat and Misra (2015),
    for example, the authors classify the transport protocols into three categories:
    Congestion Control, Reliability, and Hybrid. For the first category, some examples
    are CCF, CODA, and SIPHON; in the second category, some examples are GARUDA, PSFQ,
    and Tiny TCP/IP. For the last category, there are ART, ESRT and STCP protocols
    as examples. In Rathnayaka and Potdar (2013), the authors classify the protocols
    into three classes, in which the first class supports both congestion control
    and reliability. The protocols in this class are ART, CRRT, and . The second class
    corresponds to the protocols that support only reliability, and comprehends DTC,
    GARUDA, and RMST. The last class supports only congestion control, and includes
    ARC, CCF, CODA, and Fusion. It is known that Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are inappropriate for WSN due to many constraints
    in terms of throughput and energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2005). UDP does not
    offer reliability, flow and congestion controls, and TCP reduces the transmission
    rate when congestion occurs. In general, the most common technique in congestion
    detection is the use of buffer occupancy. Depending on the topology, the network
    might have to perform data buffering in intermediate transducers. In order to
    reduce the required sizes of these buffers, the transport layer splits large messages
    into smaller packets. Packets are transferred one at a time from station to station,
    such that intermediate stations only have to buffer one packet, rather than the
    whole message, at any time (Gajski et al., 2009). If the application requires
    synchronous data transfers and if there are buffers in the path between endpoints,
    the transport layer will have to perform additional end-to-end synchronization,
    by exchanging acknowledge messages at the end of each message. Reliability in
    the context of transport protocols refers to the successful delivery of each segment
    that the sources generate to the ultimate destination. Some protocols detect the
    congestion based on the reliability parameters. The use of factors such as time
    to recovering or the loss or successful reception of packets as parameters, is
    not always feasible, since a transmission failure may occur due to other factors
    different from congestion (e.g. problems in the channel quality). In such cases,
    the false detection of congestion may force a rate reduction, which influences
    negatively the network performance (Rathnayaka and Potdar, 2013). Some examples
    of transport layer protocols that are used in IWSN can be found in WirelessHART
    and ISA100.11a standards. The transport layer of WirelessHART cooperate with the
    network layer to provide secure and reliable end-to-end communication for network
    devices. A transport table is used to support end-to-end acknowledged transactions,
    with automatic retries. It uses a MASTER bit to identify whether the device is
    a MASTER or a SLAVE, and along with the corresponding sequence number, this table
    also buffers the payload of the last request (in MASTER mode) or response (in
    SLAVE mode). Thus, it allows the device to resend the request or response when
    the retry timer expires (Song et al., 2008). The transport layer of ISA100.11a
    provides connectionless services, which extends UDP over IPv6 with optional compression,
    as defined by the IETF 6LoWPAN specification (Nixon,). The extension includes
    better data integrity checks and additional authentication, and encryption mechanisms.
    ISA100.11a does not support acknowledged transactions at the transport layer.
    Due to the strict energy requirements imposed by end-to-end reliability mechanisms,
    and the lack of a clear proposal for reliable transport in Low power and Lossy
    Networks (LLN), the use of UDP and retransmission control mechanisms at application
    layer is an important trade-off between energy cost and reliability, when considering
    the integration of sensors into the Internet, in IETF CoAP applications (Palattella
    et al., 2013). 2.3. Network layer The routing algorithms are essentially used
    to determine good paths. The design of routing protocols for WSN must consider
    the power and resource limitations of the network nodes, the time-varying quality
    of the channel, and the possibility for packet losses and delay variations. Most
    of the routing protocols designed for WSN consider energy efficiency as the main
    design goal, with the assumption that the QoS requirements are more relaxed (Ehsan
    and Hamdaoui, 2012). However, in many industrial applications, reducing energy
    consumption is not prioritized as much as reliability, since critical processes
    could be compromised by a low reliability and availability of the network communications
    if IWSNs are unreliable. Under these constraints minimizing energy consumption
    will be in vain (Yu et al., 2017). The network protocols can be divided into three
    classes: • First class: is related to data-centric protocols, and in this class,
    there are Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation (SPIN), Cougar, Directed
    Diffusion, Rumor Routing and Gradient-Based Routing (GBR) protocols; • Second
    class: is related to hierarchical routing protocols. In this class, there are
    the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), Power-Efficient Gathering
    in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS), Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient
    sensor Network (TEEN) protocols; • Third class: is based on location. In this
    class, there are as examples Geographical and Energy Aware Routing (GEAR), Geographic
    Adaptive Fidelity (GAF), Minimum Energy Communication Network (MECN) protocols.
    Regarding routing protocols for multi-channel networks, although traditional routing
    protocols do not account for channel diversity (Draves et al., 2004), some were
    proposed in the literature. There are solutions in which the nodes use a single
    interface, and each node has a default channel for receiving data. In this case,
    a node with a packet to transmit has to switch to the channel of the receiver
    before transmitting data, however sometimes the impact of switching latency might
    make this idea unfeasible. Other solutions for multi-hop networks support multiple
    interfaces at each node. Some of them use shortest-path routes, which may not
    be suitable for multi-channel networks (Draves et al., 2004) because the shortest-path
    algorithm might select a path without ensuring that the hops are on different
    channels. Although it is possible implementing multi-channel protocols in network
    layer, it depends on the architecture of the network. Multi-channel approaches
    are more commonly found in MAC layer. Concerning the network layer of WirelessHART,
    it is based on a mesh network with redundant routes. This feature, which is not
    found in ZigBee, for example, increases the reliability, and fault tolerance (Delgado
    Gomes et al., 2013, Song et al., 2008). A network administrator defines the routes
    at the network manager, and this centralized unit is also responsible for setting
    the frequency hopping sequence, and the time scheduling among all nodes of the
    network, ensuring the correct operation of the TDMA mechanism. Although the use
    of redundant routes is not supported by the network protocol of ZigBee standard,
    protocols that use redundant routes can also be implemented in radios that are
    fully compliant with IEEE 802.15.4. WirelessHART uses four kinds of routing methods
    to ensure reliable communication: Graph, Source, Superframe, and Proxy Routing.
    In Graph Routing, the Network Manager creates a table that establishes connections
    to the devices, but the metric used to decide the neighborhood of the nodes is
    not specified in the standard (Silva et al.,, Han et al., 2011). In Source Routing,
    the Network Manager puts into the packet all the required information for routing,
    but this method is used only for network diagnosis, because if a node fails, the
    packet will be lost. Superframe Routing is similar to Graph Routing, however the
    links can only use established superframes, which allows isolating the traffic,
    but limits the amount of available links. The Proxy Routing is a Graph Routing
    used by devices when they are put into the network (Silva et al.). While the devices
    do not receive the security keys from the Network Manager, the Proxy Routing will
    be used. In Xia et al. (2017), the authors focus on routing in mixed-criticality
    industrial systems, and considers both Source Routing and Graph Routing. When
    the system is in low-criticality mode, Source Routing considers the schedulability
    of each flow, but when errors or exceptions occur, the system switches to high-criticality
    mode, and network routing turns to Graph Routing to guarantee that important flows
    can be scheduled. This approach intends to improve high-critical flows schedulability
    and analyze the schedulability of system. In Quang and Kim (2012), the authors
    proposed a two-hop neighbor information-based gradient routing on IWSNs. According
    to their simulation results, high deadline delivery success ratio can be achieved.
    Other work (Quang and Kim, 2014) presented a cluster-based throughput-aware routing
    protocol for IWSNs to decrease latency. In this protocol, the synchronization
    of the whole network is not required, making it suitable for a large-scale network,
    but extra-equipped cluster heads are needed, increasing the cost of deployment.
    All these protocols aim for real-time performance in IWSNs, but high reliability
    is not their main focus. In order to work in mission-critical WSNs, and provide
    reliable and deadline-constrained communication, it has been shown that flooding
    for routing might be one feasible alternative (Yu et al., 2017, Soyturk and Altilar,
    2008). Different from traditional routing protocols, a flooding-based routing
    allows multipath diversity, and due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium,
    ACK packets can be avoided to shorten the transmission latency, and all adjacent
    nodes of a transmitting node may overhear the packets, so packet forwarding can
    be more flexible. In Yu et al. (2017), an enhanced version of the flooding-based
    routing protocol (REALFLOW) is presented to fulfill the strict requirements of
    mission-critical industrial applications. The drawback of this protocol is that
    it only supports one sink, and longer measurements in different industrial environments
    need to be performed to confirm the performance of this approach. Despite the
    advantages of flooding method, it may produce excessive amounts of redundant traffic,
    and unnecessary packet forwarding may occur. Several researches on flooding-based
    routing have been done, but most of them can only support uplink transmission
    from a node to a sink, which is a strong limitation when implementing IWSN. The
    network layer in ISA100.11a utilizes 6LoWPAN, and the compatibility with IPv6
    allows the devices to connect to the Internet (Kumar et al., 2014). In its network,
    it is possible for server/client pairs to generate IPv6 packets, which are forwarded
    through 6LoWPAN edge routers to 6LoWPAN-enabled devices. This router performs
    the adaptation from IPv6 format to a 6LoWPAN format that can be understood by
    the devices. The ISA100.11a mesh forwards the IP-based packets to the destination
    according to routing information configured in the Data Link Layer (DLL) header.
    The IPv6 packets fragmentation and reassembling are performed in the 6LoWPAN adaptation
    layer (Nixon). In order to design a routing solution for IP-based (IPv6) LLN,
    IETF Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL) Working Group1 was formed.
    After evaluating OSPF, IS-IS, AODV, and OLSR protocols, and finding that none
    of them satisfied the routing requirements for LLN, the group specified the RPL.2
    The RPL in based on the IPv6 routing architectural framework, as it is suitable
    for time varying link loss characteristics, and have low CPU and memory requirements
    (Tripathi et al., 2010). The authors in Ko et al. (2011) describe how 6LoWPAN
    and RPL implementations from TinyOS and Contiki operating systems were used together
    in the same network, even though the two implementations were developed independent
    of each other. TinyOS and Contiki are described in Section 5.1. The objective
    of RPL is to build a network topology on top of an LLN that includes multiple
    partially overlapping link-layer broadcast domains. RPL builds multiple Destination-Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG), each one rooted at a different sink, which are
    tree-based network topologies where all the links are oriented in such a way that
    no cycles exist (Ancillotti et al., 2013). Each RPL node can be part of at most
    one DODAG. This implies that DODAGs are not overlapping, and their union, called
    a DAG, is a partition covering the entire network topology. In addition, the protocol
    introduces the concept of a RPL instance, in which DODAGs within the same instance
    share the same routing metrics and constraints, and multiple RPL instances can
    run independent of each other within a single network topology. This enables traffic
    prioritization through the differentiation of traffic forwarding techniques. When
    building the network topology, each router identifies a stable set of parents
    on a path towards the DODAG root, and associates itself to a preferred parent,
    based on an Objective Function (OF) (Gaddour and Koubâa, 2012). The OF defines
    how RPL nodes translate one or more metrics into ranks, and how to select and
    optimize routes in a DODAG. It is responsible for rank computation based on specific
    routing metrics (e.g. delay, link quality, connectivity etc.), and for specifying
    routing constraints and optimization objectives. The design of efficient OFs is
    still an open research issue. There is a draft3 that proposed the use of Expected
    Transmission Count (ETX) as the path selection criteria in RPL routing. The metric
    ETX is discussed in more details in Section 4.2. Other important routing protocol
    for data collection is the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) (Colesanti and Santini).
    It computes any-cast routes to a single or a small number of designated sinks
    in a WSN. While the CTP specification (Fonseca et al.) describes protocol packet
    formats and interoperability requirements, several aspects are left open for specific
    implementations, such as the timings for routing and forwarding packets. The CTP
    uses routing messages (beacons) for tree construction and maintenance, and data
    messages to report application data to the sink. Its standard implementation consists
    of three main logical software components: Routing Engine (RE), Forwarding Engine
    (FE), and Link Estimator (LE). The RE sends and receives beacons, to create and
    update the routing table. This engine is instantiated in each node, and the routing
    table is filled using the information extracted from the beacons. Besides the
    identification of the nodes and their neighbors, the table has a metric (ETX)
    indicating the quality of the connection to a node that might be a potential parent.
    The FE is in charge of forwarding data packets which may either come from the
    application layer of the same node or from neighboring nodes (Colesanti and Santini).
    In addition, it is responsible for detecting and repairing routing loops as well
    as suppressing duplicate packets. The LE determines the inbound and outbound quality
    of 1-hop communication links. There is an implementation of CTP for the Castalia
    Simulator,4 and the current distribution of TinyOS (2.1.2) also includes an implementation
    of this protocol. Castalia simulator is better described in Section 5.2. 2.4.
    MAC Layer MAC protocols play an important role in ensuring an effective WSN data
    communication service. Although many MAC protocols have been developed for wireless
    networks, many of them are not suitable for WSN because they were not designed
    with energy conservation as main concern (Zhao et al., 2012). Nevertheless, energy
    efficiency cannot be the only design concern. Traditionally, issues such as delay,
    throughput, robustness, scalability, stability, and fairness have dominated the
    design of MAC protocols (Sohraby et al., 2007). There is a number of classifications
    of MAC protocols for WSN in the literature. There are classifications according
    to contention- and schedule-based protocols, or random access, slotted access,
    frame-based, and hybrid protocols. In this paper, the classification of MAC protocols
    are into contention-based, contention-free (scheduled-based) and hybrid protocols.
    In contention-based protocols, the devices access the shared channel in asynchronous
    manner, and they compete for it whenever there are packets in their buffers to
    be sent. Their drawback is energy inefficiency due to idle listening, collisions,
    overheading, and control packet overhead (Durresi, 2005), although they provide
    good scalability required by WSN to support the node changes. The contention-free
    protocols are based on scheduling, and their advantages include the absence of
    collision and few control-packet overheads required to maintain the synchronization
    among the nodes. Their disadvantage occurs when new nodes are added or removed.
    For that, it is required re-establishment of routing and restart of the network,
    which affect network stability. In addition, fixed time slot in the packet exchange
    restricts the network''s adaptability to traffic variations. When the fixed time
    slot is long but traffic load is low, energy-efficiency will be reduced. When
    the fixed time slot is short but traffic load is heavy, the end-to-end delay will
    be prolonged (Zhao et al., 2012) The hybrid version of MAC protocols might be
    designed to switch its behavior between contention- and scheduled-based protocols
    according to the traffic characteristics. In Zheng et al. (2016), the authors
    propose a novel MAC protocol defined as wireless arbitration (WirArb) which grants
    each user channel access based on their different priority levels. This protocol
    supports multiple users and each user is pre-assigned a specific arbitration frequency,
    which decides the order of channel access, ensuring that the user with the highest
    priority will immediately gain channel access and we can guarantee a deterministic
    behavior. The results show that the proposed solution outperforms TDMA-based WSNs
    in terms of latency, throughput and channel utilization. Additionally, given the
    potential existence of critical processes in industrial environments, assigning
    different priority levels to nodes is a suitable strategy in IWSN. Some authors
    have proposed novel MAC protocols for real-time communication based on the physical
    layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (Flammini et al., 2009, Bartolomeu et al.,
    2017, Franchino and Buttazzo, 2017, Correia et al., 2015). Other works have evaluated
    the performance of the protocols defined in the standards for IWSN (Grsu et al.,
    2016, Jeong and Lee, 2012, Lee and Jeong, 2012, Alderisi et al., 2015, Juc et
    al., 2016) or proposed mechanisms to improve the performance of these protocols
    (Du and Roussos, 2011, Du and Roussos, 2013, Anwar et al., 2016, Patti et al.,
    2014, Patti and Lo Bello, 2016, Sahoo et al.,, Serizawa et al., 2017, Gomes et
    al., 2017). Flammini et al. (2009) proposed a MAC protocol based on CSMA/CA and
    TDMA for networks with star topology. The communication is controlled by a network
    coordinator using beacon frames. The structure defined for the protocol is similar
    to the one used in the DSME, which includes a contention access period (using
    CSMA/CA) for acyclic communication (e.g. network management packets), and a contention-free
    period, based on TDMA, for periodic communication. One limitation of the protocol
    is that only two channels are used in the whole network, the Communication Channel
    (CC), and the Backup Channel (BC). The coordinator defines the channels, and the
    decision is based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements
    to identify the channels with the lower level of noise. The coordinator informs
    to the nodes using the beacon if the CC or the BC channel must be used for data
    transmission in each cycle. The channels are chosen based on the channel quality
    estimation given by the measurements of the noise at the coordinator. Multipath
    problems cannot be assessed through measurements of the noise floor. In addition,
    the protocol is not capable to deal with spatial variations in the quality of
    the channels. Bartolomeu et al. (2017) proposed the Wireless Flexible Time Triggered
    (WFTT) protocol, for networks with strict time constraints. The WFTT is based
    on the bandjacking technique, in which the communication medium is occupied by
    a noise generator in a synchronized way, to avoid the interference from neighboring
    contention-based communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi networks. Only external
    interference caused by radios that use contention-based MAC protocols (e.g. CSMA/CA)
    were considered. Interference problems from radios that use contention-free protocols,
    or other equipment (e.g. microwave ovens) are not avoided by the protocol. The
    WFTT also uses beacons (the trigger packets), but only one channel is used to
    transmit the trigger packets, which is a single point of failure. In addition,
    the protocol is not capable to deal with multipath problems that can affect the
    quality of the links. All the end-nodes also use the same channel for communication,
    but the same channel can present different characteristics for different nodes,
    due to the spatial variations in the quality of the channel, and the diverse spatial
    allocation of the nodes which leads to different channel qualities. The Wireless
    Budget Sharing Token (WBuST) protocol is proposed in Franchino and Buttazzo (2017).
    The WBuST is a hybrid MAC protocol with contention-based communication and contention-free
    communication. In WBuST, the network is divided into clusters, and each cluster
    has a coordinator. Different channels are used in different clusters to avoid
    collisions, and inside a cluster, the communication occurs based on a structure
    called Communication Window (CW). Subsequent CWs are separated by beacon frames,
    transmitted periodically by the cluster''s coordinator. The communication between
    different clusters is made through the coordinators, which allows building networks
    with different topologies (e.g. star or cluster-tree). The main limitation of
    the MAC protocol proposed in Franchino and Buttazzo (2017) is the absence of a
    channel diversity mechanism to deal with the problems that can affect the quality
    of the links over time, such as interference and fading problems. Even different
    channels are used for different clusters, all communication inside the clusters
    occurs using only one channel, which is a single point of failure. Correia et
    al. (2015) proposed the DynMAC protocol, which uses dynamic channel reconfiguration.
    The MAC protocol is based on TDMA, and the channel to be used by all nodes in
    the network (the global best channel) is defined by the sink node of the network,
    using information collected from the nodes of the network, through RSSI samples
    or the Packet Error Rate (PER) calculated by the nodes. The main limitation of
    the DynMAC protocol is the use of only one channel in all network. The evaluation
    of the protocol was made using a simplistic simulation model (unit disk graph
    radio model), and with a short distance between nodes. Besides, the experiments
    were not performed in a realistic environment. This protocol could work well in
    a scenario where external interference are the only source of link quality disturbance.
    However, in industrial environments, fading and shadowing also need to be considered,
    as well as the link asymmetry, and the spatial and temporal variations that can
    occur in the link quality in such environments, as can be seen in experiments
    described in Agrawal et al. (2014), Gomes et al., 2017b, Tanghe et al. (2008).
    2.5. Physical layer A prerequisite to deploy WSN for monitoring and control in
    the process industries is the knowledge of the propagation characteristics of
    the radio channel, which helps to better characterize the variations in the transmitter
    signals due to the propagation environment. In industry, variability in the characteristics
    of the channels may be observed due to the multipath profile of the environment.
    Multipath problems are caused by reflection, diffraction, and scattering of electromagnetic
    fields. Besides that, multipath and shadowing are caused by large and small-scale
    fading due to the presence of many objects (usually made with metallic materials),
    and interference occurs, possibly caused by other wireless networks (Tanghe et
    al., 2008). The random movements of people or objects such as robots and trucks
    may cause time-varying effects in the wireless channel. If the aforementioned
    propagation effects are not taken into account, they can significantly degrade
    the performance of WSN in industry. Indoor radio propagation channels have been
    extensively studied, and to justify the modeling, many measurement campaigns have
    been conducted in different buildings (Olofsson et al., 2016). The intention is
    to characterize the radio channel properties and to build statistical models that
    can be used for system design. Previous investigations show that the channel gains
    in indoor environments can often be well described by Log-normal, Rayleigh, Rice,
    Nakagami models (Hashemi et al., 1994), but the best distribution is dependent
    on the environment. 2.5.1. Wireless channel models In industrial environments,
    there is a high degree of attenuation at large and small scale. Large-scale fading
    is the result of signal attenuation due to signal propagation over large distances
    and diffraction around large objects in the propagation path. The parameter that
    characterizes the large-scale fading is the path loss. Path loss is caused by
    the attenuation of the signal along the propagation path and is expressed as the
    ratio between the transmitted and received power (Cheffena, 2016). Eq. (1), called
    Log-Distance Path Loss, shows the path loss in for a distance d between transmitter
    and receiver. (1) In this log-distance path loss model, the average received power
    decreases logarithmically with distance. The parameter n represents the path loss
    exponent, which may vary depending on the environment. The path loss in the distance
    d depends on n and on the path loss at the reference distance . can be determined
    by the equation . is the wavelength of the carrier. There is a variation in the
    power of received signal, depending on where the measurement is made. To capture
    this variation, a random variable of Gaussian distribution in dB with zero mean
    and standard deviation is added to Eq. (2), which is called Log-normal Shadowing.
    (2) Like n, is also dependent on the environment. In Tanghe et al. (2008), experiments
    were conducted to determine both n and log-normal shadowing in industrial environments
    in the frequencies 900, 2400 and 5200 MHz. Besides path loss, one should also
    examine the small-scale fading in industrial environments. Small-scale fades are
    related to the rapid changes in signal strength over a small area or time interval
    due to multipath. In Tanghe et al. (2008), studies have been conducted about the
    temporal variation in the level of energy in the channels. This variation is linked
    especially to the movement of obstacles around transmitter and receiver, and is
    due to the changes of the multipath profile over time. The results of the experiments
    presented in Tanghe et al. (2008) validated the use of Rice distribution as a
    model for the temporal attenuation. This distribution describes the attenuation
    on a small scale when there is a stationary dominant signal and random components
    overlap to this main component (Rappaport, 2001). Studies were done to determine
    K factor of Rice in the related scenarios. The distribution of K values obtained
    in all the measurements are correspondent to a Log-normal distribution, with a
    mean value of 12 dB and standard deviation of 5.4 dB. Rice factor is obtained
    according to Eq. (3), and the probability density function of Rice distribution
    is shown in Eq. (4). (3) (4) represents the part that does not vary along the
    time, relative to the power of the stationary component, and is the variable part
    due to movements which change the multipath components patterns. In the industrial
    environments studied in Tanghe et al. (2008), there was a high value of K if compared
    to that found in office environments. This can be explained by the open nature
    of the industrial buildings, and the large number of reflective materials. Thus,
    there are many invariant rays on the environment and only a small part of the
    multipath profile is affected by moving objects. Although Rice distribution has
    been validated in Tanghe et al. (2008), measurement performed in Sexton et al.
    (2005) shows different distributions for various locations of indoor industrial
    environment, in which most of them presented Nakagami-m characteristics while
    some presented Log-normal and Rayleigh characteristics. In Olofsson et al. (2016),
    through extensive measurements performed at three different factory buildings,
    the fading characteristics for mobile transceivers behaved like Rayleigh or close
    to Rayleigh distribution, but for fixed transceivers, the use of a single fading
    distribution is not enough to characterize the different environments. It is clear
    that a single distribution cannot be used to analyze the received signal power.
    Thus, more measurements in different industrial environments are needed to model
    properly the envelope distribution of the received signal, especially when the
    network is meant to be deployed for a long time duration. In Hashemi (1993), despite
    the movement of people and equipment in the environment, over a short interval
    of time the channel can be regarded as wide-sense stationary or quasi stationary.
    In a measurement campaign in Gomes et al. (2015) performed by the authors of this
    survey, in which part of the industry is depicted in Fig. 1, it is observed that
    the properties of a link could change dramatically over long periods because of
    motion in the environment. Fig. 4 shows abrupt changes in the link characteristics
    during 30 min using one link. Fig. 5 expands the same experiment to 50 h with
    three different links. In the experiments, a star network was settled connecting
    three nodes, which are monitoring three motors simultaneously, and the three nodes
    communicate with the same sink node, using the same channel. Some of the observed
    changes are due to movements of different objects around the nodes in the measurement

    coherence bandwidth Some studies were carried out to verify the Root Mean Square
    (RMS) delay spread and the maximum excess delay spread in industrial environments.
    The authors in Stenumgaard et al. (2012), (2013) observed the characteristics
    of three types of industrial environments: very reflective, absorptive, and environments
    that fit between reflective and absorptive. The results showed that reflective
    environments present much more multipath components and present greater RMS delay
    spread in all the channels studied. In 2.4 GHz frequency, for example, the mean
    excess delay was 86 ns in a reflective environment, and 42 ns in an absorptive
    environment. The RMS delay spread was 294.19 ns and 28.9 ns, respectively. The
    coherence bandwidth of a channel is the frequency range ( ) at which a channel
    is correlated. Two signals transmitted in frequencies separated more than are
    affected differently by the channel (Proakis, 1995). The coherence bandwidth can
    be defined as (Varela and Sanchez, 2001), in which is a factor that can vary according
    to the power delay profile; when the correlation between frequencies is greater
    than 90%, can be equal to 50, or equal to 5 when the correlation between frequencies
    is greater than 50% (MacLeod et al., 2005). The variable is the RMS delay spread
    in seconds, therefore considering , and for an industrial environment (Stenumgaard
    et al., 2013), . While the standard specifies 5 MHz channels, only approximately
    2 MHz of the channel is consumed with the occupied bandwidth, so for this scenario,
    the channels are uncorrelated in frequency. For outdoor environments, the RMS
    delay spread is higher compared to that found in indoor industrial environments.
    For mobile radio channels, the delay is in the order of microseconds, and indoors
    the delays are in the order of nanoseconds (Rappaport, 2001). As the radios used
    in WSN have a relatively low symbol rate, intersymbol interference may not be
    a problem for these indoor networks. For example, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard has
    a symbol rate of 62.5 kbaud in 2.4 GHz band, which represents a symbol period
    of 16 μs. Fig. 6 shows RSS values obtained in other experiment performed by the
    authors of this survey inside an industrial environment with transmitter and received
    nodes, 30 m away, without line of sight and several obstructions and metal objects
    (Gomes et al., 2017a). Download : Download high-res image (294KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. RSS measurements (in dBm) in channel 11 and channel 19.
    When the nodes were tuned to channel 11, the Packet Reception Rate (PRR) was around
    91%, and when the nodes were tuned to channel 19, the PRR was around 51%. Therefore,
    even without considering interference, changing the channel may improve the quality
    of the communication due to the different characteristics of the channels at the
    same time. 2.5.3. Noise and electromagnetic interference As discussed in Section
    1, due to the increasing number of applications using wireless technologies, the
    spectrum available for communication tends to become more congested, increasing
    interference, and reducing the QoS of networks that coexists in the same environment.
    Thereat, the static spectrum allocation approaches tend not to work satisfactorily
    in such a congested channel. Mechanisms allowing smarter use of the spectrum should
    be developed to mitigate the problems related to the interference of coexisting
    networks. Some studies were carried out to identify possible sources of interference
    in different environments. In Chilo et al. (2009), the authors conducted a study
    on the intensity of the electric field, and the Amplitude Probability Distribution
    (APD) of noise in a paper industry. The APD allows analyzing the percentage of
    time an impulse signal exceeds a certain threshold. The results show that the
    most common equipment that can cause interference in 2.4 GHz band are microwave
    ovens, industrial heaters, radiofrequency lighting systems and welding equipment.
    However, these devices are not always present in the industry. Other sources of
    interference, usually found in industrial environments, are electric motors, frequency
    inverters, and wireless communication equipment, such as cordless phones and wireless
    local area network equipment. Some sources of interference, especially those related
    to industrial equipment, such as motors and frequency inverters, are present in
    the range of a few hundred MHz, which may disturb communication in proprietary
    systems that use this frequency range, but do not interfere with systems that
    use the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Stenumgaard et al., 2013, Stenumgaard et al., 2012).
    In Angskog et al. (2010), the authors verified the frequency bands affected by
    a set of sources of interference. The results showed that combustion engines and
    welding equipment cause interference only below 1 GHz. In Delgado Gomes et al.
    (2012), an experimental study was carried out to verify the correlation between
    packet loss rate and mean power in the IEEE 802.15.4 radio channel subject to
    interference from an IEEE 802.11 network and a microwave oven. The results showed
    that these sources of interference significantly increase the energy level in
    the channels, having a direct influence on the communication performance of the
    radios. In some scenarios, the packet loss rate of IEEE 802.15.4 radios has reached
    90% when subjected to interference of an IEEE 802.11 network. When subjected to
    microwave oven interference, the worst case packet loss rate was around 50% when
    the IEEE 802.15.4 radios were operating on channels 21 and 23. A certain correlation
    was observed between the mean power level in the channel and the packet loss rate.
    However, the relationship between mean power and packet loss rate is different
    for each type of interference source. In this way, more elaborated metrics needs
    to be developed to accurately estimate the channel quality. In Lima-Filho et al.
    (2012), experiments were performed to investigate the impact of an IEEE 802.11
    network and a microwave oven on the performance of a WSN for monitoring of motors
    in an industrial environment. Similar results to those described in Delgado Gomes
    et al. (2012) were observed, with the packet loss rate reaching about 90% when
    the WSN was subject to interference from the IEEE 802.11 network. In Guo et al.
    (2012), experiments are described to verify the influence of the distance between
    transmitter and receiver, and between sensor nodes and sources of interference
    (Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and microwave oven) in a building environment. A packet
    loss rate of up to 25% was observed due to the interferences of the IEEE 802.11
    network and microwave oven, for the scenarios under consideration. The interference
    from the Bluetooth radios was very small. This is due to the frequency hopping
    mechanism defined by the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, which uses 79 channels of 1 MHz
    over the 2.4 GHz band. 3. Standards used in IWSN Many communication technologies
    for low-power wireless networking were developed to maintain the completely industrial
    process running in a reliable and efficient condition. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is among the most prominent communication technologies for low-power wireless
    networks. In addition, it has been used as a baseline for other standard communication
    protocols/models, such as WirelessHART and 6LoWPAN (Tennina et al., 2013). The
    IEEE 802.15.4 standard is designed for WSN requiring low cost, low power, low
    data rate (up to some few hundred of kbps), and scalability. If compared to IEEE
    802.11 and IEEE 802.15.1, IEEE 802.15.4 is more suitable for the industrial device
    monitoring system requiring long lifetime nodes powered by battery because of
    the low power consumption, longer battery life and lower cost (Gungor and Hancke,
    2013). However, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is not suitable for industry requirements
    (Akerberg et al., 2011) due to the use of CSMA/CA instead of TDMA (Zheng et al.,
    2016), and the use of a single channel in the whole network. Although several
    papers have described the standards used in industry (Song et al., 2008, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Silva et al.,, Tennina et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2008, Petersen
    and Carlsen, 2011, Rezha and Shin, 2014, Zhong et al., 2010, Lee, 2006, Huang
    et al., 2009, Du et al., 2015, Misic and Misic, 2008, Kiyumi et al., 2015, Alderisi
    et al., 2015), it is still important to mention the main characteristics and drawbacks
    of each one. This section describes the four main standards used in IWSN, and
    based on the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY layer, besides the amendment IEEE 802.15.4e. 3.1.
    IEEE 802.15.4 The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has been designed to specify the PHY
    and MAC sublayers for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN) for the
    low-cost devices communications with a short range and low power consumption.
    ZigBee is perhaps the most well-known example of wireless products on the market
    that utilize the 802.15.4 standard (Gungor and Hancke, 2013). At PHY, the standard
    defines three frequency bands: 2450 MHz (16 channels), 915 MHz (10 channels),
    and 868 MHz (1 channel), all using the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
    access mode. The 2450 MHz band employs Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (O-QPSK)
    for modulation with a data rate of 250 kbps, while the 868 and the 915 MHz bands
    make use of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), supporting 20 and 40 kbps, respectively.
    Experimental studies described in Lee (2006) showed that the actual maximum bit
    rate in 2450 MHz frequency band is around 153 kbit/s. This reduced value is due
    to the mechanism used for collision avoidance in the MAC layer (CSMA/CA). The
    standard defines two types of nodes, Reduced Function Devices (RFD) and Full Function
    Devices (FFD). FFD implements the full IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack, and RFD implements
    a subset of the protocol stack. FFD can be a coordinator, a gateway or a router,
    and RFD is a simple end device in charge of sensing and actuating tasks. When
    acting as a network coordinator, a FFD node may send beacons that provide synchronization,
    communication, and coordination. Beacon and non-beacon modes are discussed below
    (Bartolomeu et al., 2016). In a ZigBee network, the standard defines three types
    of topology: star, peer-to-peer, and cluster-tree, as illustrated in Fig. 7. In
    the star topology, a unique node operates as a Personal Area Network (PAN) coordinator,
    and is a node to which all sensing information is sent. One disadvantage of star
    topology is its very limited coverage while addressing a large-scale WSN, leading
    to scalability problems. Some solutions mitigated this problem by using multihop
    and multiple channels, which are discussed later in this survey. Download : Download

    used in IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The point-to-point, also called mesh topology,
    includes a coordinator as well, however the communication paradigm in this topology
    is decentralized, in which each node can directly communicate with any other node
    within its range. This improves flexibility but it is more complex to provide.
    It allows multiple hops to route data from any node to any other node. The cluster-tree
    topology is a special case of point-to-point network where there is a single routing
    path between any pair of nodes. There is only one coordinator, which identifies
    the entire network and one router per cluster. Any of the FFD can act as a router
    providing synchronization services to other devices and routers (Tennina et al.,
    2013). The IEEE 802.5.4 MAC layer defines two operating modes: beacon-enabled
    and non-beacon mode. In beacon-enabled mode, the coordinator sends periodic beacon
    frames to synchronize the rest of the nodes. Synchronization enables dynamic duty-cycle
    management, allowing nodes to save their energy by entering in the sleep mode.
    These energy saving periods enable the extension of the network lifetime, which
    is one of the most important requirements of WSN, but it affects latency. In addition,
    in beacon-enabled mode the synchronization allows the dynamic reservation of guaranteed
    bandwidth, through allocation of Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) in the superframe
    contention free period. However, managing the synchronization mechanism throughout
    the cluster-tree networks is a very challenging task, since the larger the network
    is, the more collision problems can occur. In beacon-enabled mode, medium access
    can also be ruled by CSMA/CA, as well as in non-beacon mode, but the former uses
    the slotted version and the later uses the unslotted one. The time interval between
    two beacon frames is called the Beacon Interval (BI), or Superframe, and is divided
    into an active period and an optional inactive period. During the inactive period,
    nodes can be kept in sleep mode to conserve their energy. The length of the active
    period is the Superframe Duration (SD) which contains 16 time slots (from 0 to
    15) with the same duration (Buratti et al., 2011). The 16 time slots in the superframe
    are subdivided into smaller slots known as the Backoff Period (BP) (Shafiullah
    Khanet al, 2013). The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer achieves duty-cycle operations by
    setting two system parameters, (BO) and (SO) to achieve low power consumption
    for ZigBee devices (Huang et al., 2009). The first one specifies the period during
    which the coordinator can communicate the beacon frames. The second one specifies
    the duration of the active portion plus the beacon frame (Khanafer et al., 2014,
    Queiroz et al., 2017). The value of BO is related to the BI, and SO is related
    to SD, in which (Du et al., 2015). If BO is set to 15, the value of SO is ignored
    and beacon frames will not be sent except upon request (Khanafer et al., 2014).
    As depicted in Fig. 8, the active period comprises Contention Access Period (CAP)
    and Contention Free Period (CFP) (Zhan et al., 2016). During CAP, nodes use the
    slotted CSMA/CA algorithm to access the channel. During CFP, up to seven GTS can
    be allocated by the coordinator for each superframe, which allow the node to communicate
    on the timeslot that is dedicated exclusively to it Du et al. (2015). A node with
    an assigned GTS has full access to the channel during its GTS. Nodes activity
    during it should be completed before the start of the next GTS or the end of the
    CFP (Khanafer et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image (260KB) Download

    in 2016 and January 2017 using the “IEEE 802.15.4” term in the keyword field,
    in IEEE Xplore were found 64 papers, in ScienceDirect were found 20, and in ACM
    Digital were found six documents. From all those documents, around 50% are research
    papers focused on ZigBee. Some of the topics found are related as follows: • Throughput
    measurement and performance improvement of IEEE 802.15.4 under interference, including
    channel utilization scheme; • Techniques of cooperative communication and network
    coding to mitigate electromagnetic noise, channel coding for energy and temperature
    monitoring, calculation of optimum transmit power employing cooperative relaying,
    protocols for cooperative sensing, and implementation of selection cooperation;

    energy efficiency seem to have been the main concerns regarding this standard
    recently. 3.2. WirelessHART WirelessHART is a wireless communication standard
    designed to meet the needs for process automation applications (Gungor and Hancke,
    2013). It was the first open standard specifically designed for wireless communication
    in process measurement and control applications (Song et al., 2008), and was officially
    presented by HART Communication Foundation in 2007, with the restriction of being
    compatible to the existing HART devices by adding wireless communication capability
    to the HART protocol. The WirelessHART specification was approved by the International
    Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as a full international standard (IEC 62591)
    in March 2010. WirelessHART is a secure and TDMA-based wireless mesh networking
    technology operating in 2.4 GHz ISM radio band. Actually, it uses the Time Synchronized
    Mesh Protocol (TSMP) (Kumar et al., 2014, Pister and Doherty, 2008), which was
    developed by Dust Networks for MAC and network layer functions. Before WirelessHART
    is released, there were some standards for office and manufacturing automation,
    such as ZigBee IEEE 802.15.4 standard and Bluetooth. However, they could not meet
    the stringent requirements of industrial applications. ZigBee does not have built-in
    frequency hopping techniques to mitigate interference and multipath problems,
    and Bluetooth assumes quasi-static star network, which is not scalable to be used
    in large process control systems (Song et al., 2008). At PHY layer, WirelessHART
    adopts the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 standard, and has its own time-synchronized MAC
    layer that uses frequency hopping, and channel blacklisting. The network layer
    supports self-organizing and self-healing mesh networking techniques (Grimaldi
    et al., 2016). In addition, it supports both direct connection between device
    and gateway (star topology) and connections over multiple hops (mesh topology).
    Each network device must be able to function as source, sink and router (Kim et
    al., 2008). WirelessHART networks are centralized, with strict timing requirements
    managed by a central network manager that is used to configure the routing and
    schedule information. Fig. 9 shows an example of a WirelessHART network. Download

    Example of WirelessHART network. Following are the main devices and components
    of a WirelessHART network (Foundation, 2007): • Gateway: a network Access Point
    (AP) that connects the WirelessHART network to a plant automation network, allowing
    the data to flow between them; • Network Manager: an application that manages
    the network and its devices. The communication with the devices is command-oriented,
    and it is responsible for scheduling, device list management, and collecting statistical
    information about performance, fault detection, and network formation. The logic
    used by the manager for path construction and link scheduling is not explicitly
    specified and it is left to the final user (Grimaldi et al., 2016); • Security
    Manager: an application that is in charge of generating, storing, and managing
    join, network, and session keys; • Field Devices: sensor and actuator nodes; •
    Router: in theory, the use of routers is not required, since the field devices
    are configured automatically with routing mechanisms. However, its use could lead
    to redundant paths to the Gateway, preventing field devices from being used for
    message routing, and thereby increasing power consumption; • Handheld: device
    used to configure and monitor the field devices. As seen in Fig. 10, WirelessHART
    has a limitation of 15 frequency channels (11–25), in which channel 26 is not
    used for regulatory issues in some countries. At MAC layer, the communication
    must be done within a 10 ms (data + acknowledgment) time slot, and sequences of
    time slots form a superframe. Each transmission between two nodes must occur in
    a time slot in one of the 15 channels using the unicast method. Each superframe
    has two kinds of slots: dedicated slot at the beginning of every superframe, and
    shared slots for the rest of the superframe. During shared slots, the devices
    must compete with each other to communicate. Download : Download high-res image
    (208KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Superframe structure of WirelessHART,
    adapted from Silva et al.. After sending the packets, the devices waits for an
    ACKnowledgement (ACK). If it is not received, they will wait a random period and
    send the packet again. According to WirelessHART, the MAC sublayer uses TDMA to
    perform link scheduling during the dedicated slots period, and during shared slots
    period, the MAC sublayer uses slotted ALOHA. To ensure packet delivery, nodes
    can use three time slots in each superframe. The first two time slots are used
    for transmission and retransmission (in case of the first attempt fails) on a
    predefined route. The third slot is used to transmit the same packet using a different
    route (Wu et al., 2016). Since each slot uses a different channel, in this scenario
    each packet can be transmitted up to three times within the same superframe using
    different parameters (route or channel), so that the link becomes robust to problems
    that affects specific channels or routes. The application layer is based on HART
    commands protocol, and these commands are used by the different entities in the
    network to join, write/read data, etc. For security issues, WirelessHART uses
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 128 bits block Ciphers, similar to the
    ZigBee standard. To handle coexistence and interference efficiently, IWSN standards
    employ many spectrum management techniques (Akerberg et al., 2011). A Clear Channel
    Assessment (CCA) is performed before data transmission to ensure that the channel
    is free to use. In WirelessHART, CCA reports a busy medium if a signal compliant
    with IEEE 802.15.4 PHY modulation and spreading characteristics is detected. Each
    transmission uses a different channel, and Fig. 10 depicts frequency hopping mechanisms
    for four data streams in 200 ms (20 slots). To improve the WirelessHART communication,
    the HART Communication Protocol and Foundation (HCF) developed a document for
    best practices (HART Communication). In general, the following rules are established:
    • Each field device should have at least three neighbors. The third neighbor acts
    as a backup if one of the two primary paths is unavailable; • The gateway should
    have at least five neighbors. It works with less nodes, but for better resilience,
    five is the minimum value; • At least 25% of the network devices should reach
    the gateway in large networks. Regarding recent researches about WirelessHART,
    using the three main research databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and ACM Digital),
    a simple filter with the term set in the keyword field, and considering the year
    2016, and the first month of 2017, 22 documents were found in IEEE Xplore, four
    in ScienceDirect, and one in ACM Digital. The papers focus on performance analysis,
    data aggregation techniques to guarantee energy-efficient and real-time communication,
    RF power modulation technique to reduce energy consumption, delay effects on the
    control system''s performance, autonomous diagnostic tool, filtered feedback PID5
    control, long network lifetime with Graph Routing, and WirelessHART adaptor for
    process control applications. Reliable graph routing is well described in Han
    et al. (2011), in which the authors present efficient algorithms to construct
    them, and describe the recovery mechanisms in the event of component failures.
    The main advantage is that, based on these graphs, data link layer communication
    schedules are generated to achieve end-to-end real-time performance. 3.3. ISA100.11a
    The International Society of Automation (ISA) initiated a work on a family of
    standards to implement wireless systems for industrial automation and control
    applications. The main purpose of ISA-100 committee is to provide a family of
    standards for industrial wireless networks, and ISA100.11a is the first standard
    of the family. It was released in 2009, and describes a mesh network designed
    to provide secure wireless communication to process control. It received the IEC
    approval as international standard (IEC 62734) in 2011. An ISA100.11a device have
    one or more of the following tasks (Standard, 2009), as depicted in Fig. 11: •
    (I/O): the devices can provide or use data through sensors or actuators. They
    do not have routing capabilities; • : it acts like a proxy, routing the data toward
    the gateway; • : high level routing, increasing the throughput of the network
    as long as more sub-networks are created. The communication between them uses
    the 6LoWPAN. It is also responsible for tunneling; • : a device (router) may enable
    other devices to join a specific network; • : a device may provide an interface
    between the field devices and the plant automation network; • : an application
    that is in charge of the network tasks; • : an application that, in cooperation
    with the system manager, is responsible for the generation, storage and distribution
    of the necessary security keys and is also supposed to manage authentication;
    • : a device (router) responsible to maintain the master time source for the system;
    • : device used to configure, test, and monitor the field devices. Download :

    of ISA100.11a network. Similar to WirelessHART, PHY layer is based on the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard, and is designed to support a maximum of 50-100 devices in the
    network (Petersen and Carlsen, 2011). ISA100.11a standard uses frequency hopping
    and channel blacklisting to reduce the interference effects, and applies different
    methods for frequency hopping called slotted, slow, and hybrid hopping, as depicted
    in Fig. 12. In slotted hopping, each communication occurs in a different frequency.
    There is an order to be followed to optimize the coexistence with IEEE 802.11
    and WirelessHART standards, but it is possible to choose the channels following
    a specific sequence (Silva et al.). In slow hopping, the devices change its channels
    at specific intervals (100–400 ms), and is used by devices that lost synchronization.
    For coexistence issues, it is recommended to use the channels 15, 20 and 25 in
    the slow hopping. The hybrid hopping uses both techniques to optimize the sending
    of alarms and retransmissions. Download : Download high-res image (403KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Different frequency hopping profiles of ISA100.11a,
    adapted from Rezha and Shin (2014). The standard uses 16 channels (11–26), but
    the channel 26 is optional. At MAC layer, it combines TDMA with CSMA in order
    to use the advantages of both techniques, and defines routing at this layer. The
    time slots have 10 ms or 12 ms, and duration can be dedicated or shared. The dedicated
    slots are used for contention-free communications, and in the shared slots, the
    media access uses an exponential backoff algorithm, similar to CSMA/CA. The MAC
    layer is divided into three sublayers: MAC Sublayer, MAC Extension, and Upper
    Data Link Layer. The first one is a subset of IEEE 802.15.4, the second adds new
    characteristics related to CSMA/CA, TDMA, and frequency hopping (Silva et al.),
    and the third one is in charge of routing at MAC layer. Similar to WirelessHART,
    a security manager exists in ISA100.11a embedded with the system manager and gateway
    on the same physical device. The security feature is optional in ISA100.11a to
    provide greater flexibility and improve battery life, and the end-to-end security
    is performed in the transport layer (Petersen and Carlsen, 2011). In Serizawa
    et al. (2017), a mechanism called Adaptive Channel Diversity (ACD) is proposed
    for ISA100.11a networks. In the proposed protocol, the network is divided into
    groups, and the end-nodes inside the same group share the time-slots allocated
    to the group. The ACD mechanism use information about the quality of the channels
    to avoid using channels affected by interference sources. The communication duration
    is divided into four time segments, where three of them are dedicated to the ACD
    mechanism, which incurs in a high overhead. The solution described in Serizawa
    et al. (2017) has the same limitations of the solution described in Du and Roussos
    (2013); Du and Roussos (2011), since only interference problems are considered.
    Besides, many time slots are dedicated to the ACD mechanism, which increase the
    overhead of the protocol and the latency of the network. Using the same filter
    performed for WirelessHART with the three research databases and the term ISA100.11a
    set in the keyword field, during the year 2016 and the first month of 2017, in
    IEEE Xplore were found four documents IEEE Xplore, one in ScienceDirect, and none
    in ACM Digital. Among those papers, only two focus on specifically ISA100.11a.
    The first one studies Adaptive Channel Diversity (ACD) method, and the other one
    evaluates the performance of networks that follow the standard. 3.4. WIA-PA There
    is a few papers published about the WIA-PA (Wireless Networks for Industrial Automation
    and Process Automation) standard, if compared to the aforementioned ones. It is
    the Chinese standard of industrial wireless communication architecture and specification
    for process automation. It was accepted by IEC in 2008 and was called IEC/PAS
    62601. WIA-PA standard adopts IEEE 802.15.4 PHY without modification in order
    to co-exist with the IEEE 802.15.4-based systems. It is designed for measuring,
    monitoring and open-loop control of industrial processes (Zhong et al., 2010),
    which correspond to the classes 3–5 of the industrial process automation applications
    defined by the ISA100 committe (Standard, 2009). Class 0 is for critical and time-sensitive
    applications, which requires less than 10 ms latency in a deterministic manner.
    The standard supports a hierarchical network topology that combines standard mesh
    topologies with five kinds of devices: host computer, gateway, routing, field
    and handheld devices. The data link sub-layer protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4
    MAC protocol, with some additional features such as frequency hopping, packet
    aggregation/disaggregation, and time synchronization. Similar to ZigBee, WIA-PA
    implements beaconing, superframe structure, and the time slot duration is configurable.
    WIA-PA uses a hybrid protocol based on CSMA/TDMA, and uses three frequency-hopping
    mechanisms to increase the reliability and throughput: Adaptive Frequency Switching,
    Adaptive Frequency Hopping, and Time Slot Hopping (Silva and Guedes, 2014). Performing
    the same analysis about the researches over WIA-PA in 2016 and January 2017, in
    IEEE Xplore there were found two papers, and only one of them is focused specifically
    on WIA-PA. None of the other databases have found results. The only paper found
    studies a TR0696 WAN management protocol for the standard. 3.5. IEEE 802.15.4.e
    As mentioned in the previous subsection, one of the main concerns when designing
    a WSN is the energy efficiency. This is because the devices are battery-powered
    and the replacement of batteries is difficult or expensive. Besides energy, other
    requirements must be considered such as scalability, reliability and timeliness,
    in which the last two are critical issues for industrial and healthcare applications
    (De Guglielmo et al.). Several studies investigated the performance of IEEE 802.15.4
    networks (Khanafer et al., 2014, Baronti et al., 2007, Tennina et al., 2013, Lee,
    2006, Buratti et al., 2011, Zhan et al., 2016, Du et al., 2015, Huang et al.,
    2009, Misic and Misic, 2008, Eady, 2007, Kiyumi et al., 2015), and they highlighted
    the limitations of the standard, which makes it not suitable for applications
    that have stringent requirements of latency and reliability in harsh environments.
    One of the main limitations is that, unlike ISA100.11a and WirelessHART, the IEEE
    802.15.4 MAC uses a single channel and does not have a frequency hopping mechanism
    to mitigate the effects of interference and multipath. To overcome these limitations,
    the IEEE 802.15.4e standard was developed. WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and IEEE
    802.15.4e standards introduce scheduling-based MAC protocols to provide a guaranteed
    access or bounded latency, and adopt packet-level frequency hopping to improve
    the reliability of the wireless links. IEEE 802.15.4e standard defines five MAC
    protocols (behavior modes), DSME, TSCH, LLDN, AMCA and BLINK. For AMCA and BLINK
    modes, it provides only a brief description of them, therefore they are not discussed
    in this paper. In general, the improvements of IEEE 802.15.4e are regarding support
    to multi-channel communication, more flexible superframe (DSME), and the use of
    a contention-free channel access mechanism based on TDMA (it decreases collision,
    and allows minimizing the energy consumption). In the following topics, the details
    of the three main modes are outlined. 3.5.1. Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel
    Extension (DSME) This mode is intended to support industrial and commercial applications
    with stringent timeliness and reliability requirements. Similar to IEEE 802.15.4
    beacon mode, in DSME the time is divided into CAP and CFP, as depicted in Fig.
    13. Slot 0 is used to transmit Enhanced Beacons (EB), and CAP begins after the
    EB and ends before slot 9. The other seven slots belongs to CFP, and each one
    in CFP represents a DSME-GTS, used when there is traffic whose latency must be
    predictable. During the entire CAP, the frames are sent using only one channel
    and the nodes are required to be on. To obtain more GTSs and save energy in this
    case, DSME provides a mechanism called CAP Reduction. When it is enabled, only
    the first superframe of each multi-superframe presents the CAP, while in the other
    superframes, the CAP is omitted and the CFP has 15 DSME-GTS. Download : Download
    high-res image (183KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Example of
    a superframe structure for a DSME network. In DSME, the coordinators transmit
    periodically EB to keep the nodes synchronized and to allow other nodes to join
    the network. BI is composed of several superframes, which do not have inactive
    periods, and are divided into 16 equally spaced slots. Inside BI, it is possible
    to define cycles of repeated superframes called multi-superframes. During CAP,
    the nodes use a slotted CSMA/CA algorithm to access the channel, and in CFP, the
    nodes use GTS. The difference from IEEE 802.15.4 standard is that DSME extends
    the number of GTS time slots and uses multiple channels. In addition, it can accommodate
    periodic and event-driven traffics by adopting a versatile multi-superframe structure.
    Beacon scheduling and slot allocation are performed in a distributed manner, without
    depending on a central device. The links between two nodes can be dedicated, so
    neighboring nodes can communicate in a point-to-point way. Since each pair of
    nodes can allocate and deallocate GTS slots, DSME is able to adapt to the variations
    in the generated traffic and to the changes of the network topology over time.
    DSME also supports the option of Group ACKnowledgement (GACK) that allows putting
    together the ACK of multiple data frames into a single ACK frame in order to improve
    the energy efficiency. Concerning GACK, it is used when the nodes have to send
    periodic traffic to the coordinator. In this case, the coordinator uses a single
    DSME-GTS to put together all the ACK from frames received in the previous DSME-GTS
    in just one frame. This mechanism brings two advantages, energy efficiency and
    latency reduction, since the retransmissions are done inside the same multi-superframe.
    During the same GTS, multiple transmissions can be accommodated using different
    channels. Each superframe inside a multi-superframe has a different ID, and each
    DSME-GTS has an ID according to its position inside CFP. DSME mode defines two
    types of channel diversity: frequency hopping, and channel adaptation. Fig. 14
    shows two examples of scheduling for the CFP period, using frequency hopping in
    (a), and channel adaptation in (b). When using the first one, the nodes receive
    packets in different channels, depending on the channel offset of the node, on
    the slot ID, on the superframe ID, and on the sequence number of the EB sent by
    the coordinator. For example, in Fig. 14(a), Node 1 receives a packet using Channel
    0 in the first time slot, using Channel 1 in the second time slot, and so on.
    The nodes that receive packets inside the same superframe need to have different
    channel offsets, in order to avoid collisions. Download : Download high-res image
    (158KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Channel diversity mechanisms
    defined for DSME networks. When using the channel adaptation as the channel diversity
    technique, a pair of nodes communicate using the same channel while the channel
    quality is good enough in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. In order to use this
    mechanism, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of the links continuously.
    Besides the two mechanisms, a novel hybrid approach was developed and simulated
    in Gomes et al. (2017c), that uses both channel hopping and channel adaptation.
    The simulated results showed that the hybrid approach outperformed the other two
    approaches for the scenario studied in the paper. In addition, the experiments
    showed that the use of channel adaptation is better than channel hopping for the
    transmission of unicast packets, when the quality of the links is monitored continuously.
    However, for packets transmitted in broadcast by the coordinator, the use of channel
    hopping is a good alternative to deal with the spatial variation in the quality
    of the channels. The time structure in DSME is almost the same as IEEE 802.15.4,
    including the parameter macMultisyperframeOrder (MO), that determines the duration
    of multi-superframes, in which . In Table 1, SMS stands for the number of Superframes
    in a Multi-Superframe, MSBI means the number of Multi-Superframes in a BI, and
    MSD is Multi-Superframe Duration. Table 1. MAC parameters with multi-superframe.
    Parameters Value SMS superframes MSBI multi-superframes MSD aBaseSuperframeDuration
    symbols Each EB has a special field called DSME PAN Descriptor Information Element
    that contains the information of the superframe structure such as BO, SO and MO,
    and other options like GACK, CAP Reduction, etc. The SO value influences the duration
    of time slot, and MO determines the number of DSME-GTS available in each multi-superframe
    and influences the latency. It also transmits a DSME-Beacon Allocation Notification
    command during CAP to inform its neighbors about the slot allocation. In the case
    of beacon collision, the coordinator uses a Deferred Beacon option to reduce the
    probability of collision. When this option is activated, the coordinator performs
    a CCA before sending the beacon. To avoid the same EB slot to be assigned to multiple
    nodes, a DSME-Beacon Collision Notification is sent to the other node to choose
    a different EB slot. The experiments described in Jeong and Lee (2012) and Lee
    and Jeong (2012) evaluated the performance of DSME mode in comparison to the beacon-enabled
    mode of the IEEE 802.15.4. The experiments verified that, in some scenarios, the
    throughput of the IEEE 802.15.4e DSME network can be 12 times higher than the
    IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled network, and with a lower energy consumption, due
    to the use of a TDMA-based medium access. In the experiments, frequency hopping
    was used but no dynamic management of the blacklist was employed. In Sahoo et
    al., a novel MAC protocol for networks with start topology, based on DSME mode
    of the IEEE 802.15.4e, is proposed, with the goal of reducing the discovery time,
    and to optimize the bandwidth usage. To reduce the discovery time, it was proposed
    the use of additional beacon transmissions, in different channels. When a node
    attempts to join the network, a random channel is chosen, and the node waits for
    a beacon transmission in that channel. However, if the selected channel presents
    deep fading problems for the link between the new node and the coordinator, the
    time of access can be very high. This problem was not considered in the solution
    proposed on the paper. To optimize the bandwidth usage and reduce the delay, group
    ACK was employed using the beacon frames, and the nodes use the contention access
    periods to perform retransmissions instead of using dedicated time slots for retransmissions,
    as defined in the original algorithm of DSME (De Guglielmo et al.). One limitation
    of the work described in Sahoo et al. is that the channel diversity mechanisms
    of the DSME were not evaluated, which is a very important aspect to be taken into
    consideration in industrial applications. Regarding latest researches about DSME,
    using the same parameters described previously for the aforementioned standards,
    IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect databases found one paper, and ACM Digital found
    none. One paper is regarded a survey of IEEE 802.15.4e, and the other one performs
    an energy consumption and performance analysis of TSCH and DSME. 3.5.2. Time Slotted
    Channel Hopping (TSCH) The TSCH mode was developed for applications of process
    automation, and like DSME, TSCH uses EB, works in star, tree and mesh topologies,
    and employs frequency hopping mechanism. Different from DSME, which uses a periodic
    multi-superframe structure, TSCH uses periodic slotframe, dedicated time slots
    instead of time slot during CFP, and CSMA/CA with shared time slots instead of
    contention-based channel access (during CAPs). In addition, TSCH does not implement
    GACK. In TSCH, each node obtains information of synchronization, frequency hopping
    sequence, time slot and slotframe through EB. The slotframe contains either contention-based
    or contention-free time slots. The time slots assignment to the devices within
    the slotframe may initially be communicated through a beacon, but usually the
    higher network layers configure them when the device joins the network (Alderisi
    et al., 2015). Fig. 15 shows an example of link schedule, in which there are 4
    time slots, 5 channel offsets and 8 transmissions, thanks to the multi-channel
    approach of TSCH. In the example, there are two for dedicated links (D A and B
    C) and shared links (C D and E F). Download : Download high-res image (165KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 15. Example of TSCH slot frame. Since
    all devices share common time and channel information, devices may hop over the
    entire channel space to minimize the negative effects of multipath fading and
    interference, and do so in a slotted way to avoid collisions, minimizing the need
    for retransmissions. Through time synchronization and frequency hopping, TSCH
    enables high reliability while maintaining very low duty cycles, and this guarantees
    energy efficiency. The hopping sequence is defined by an ID, the sequence length,
    and an ordered list of channels. A link between communicating devices is identified
    by a pair time slot/channel offset. Shared links are intentionally assigned to
    multiple devices for transmission. This can lead to collisions and result in a
    transmission failure detected by a missing ACK, but a retransmission backoff algorithm
    (CSMA/CA algorithm) is implemented for shared links, to reduce the probability
    of repeated collisions. There are differences between IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA, and
    TSCH CSMA/CA algorithm (De Guglielmo et al.). The first difference is that in
    TSCH, besides being optional, CCA is not used to prevent collisions, but to avoid
    transmitting a packet if there is strong external interference. Other difference
    is regarding the parameter macMaxCSMABackoffs, which is not used in TSCH. The
    packet is dropped only if it reaches the maximum number of retransmissions (macMaxFrameRetries).
    Regarding the backoff mechanism, it is activated only after the node has experienced
    a collision. In TSCH, the backoff unit duration, instead of of IEEE 802.15.4,
    corresponds to a shared slot. In Grsu et al. (2016), an experiment was performed
    to analyze the performance of a TSCH network inside an aircraft cabin, with external
    interference caused by Wi-Fi networks. In the experiments, the PER was equal to
    35% when using the 16 available channels, due to the influence of interference
    on the link. In general, when fewer channels were used, the PER was lower, as
    the interference level decreases. For example, when using only one channel, the
    one less affected by the interference sources, the PER was equal to 5%. However,
    to operate using only one channel per link, an appropriate mechanism is needed
    to estimate the quality of the channels continuously and to dynamically configure
    the blacklist, which can generate a remarkable overhead. In Alderisi et al. (2015),
    a comparison between DSME and TSCH in process automation scenarios is described.
    Simulations were performed to verify the delay, reliability, and scalability of
    each mode. The TSCH presented better results for small networks, with up to 30
    nodes. For larger networks, with more than 30 nodes, the DSME presented better
    results. The simulations described in Alderisi et al. (2015) used realistic parameters
    for the log-normal shadowing, but the effect of fading and the non-stationary
    characteristics of the wireless channel were not considered. In addition, only
    the channel hopping mechanism of the DSME were analyzed. In Juc et al. (2016),
    other comparison between DSME and TSCH is described, in terms of energy consumption
    and performance. In the scenarios under consideration, the energy consumption
    of DSME was slightly better than TSCH, as well as the performance. In applications
    that send less data, the TSCH wastes bandwidth, due to the fixed size of the time
    slots. In the experiments described in Juc et al. (2016) only channel hopping
    was considered. The use of adaptive frequency hopping for TSCH networks was proposed
    in Du and Roussos (2011); Du and Roussos (2013), to avoid using channels affected
    by interference sources. In this approach, two time slots in each cycle are used
    to perform readings of RSSI values. Based on these measurements, the blacklist
    is updated to avoid the channels with a high level of interference. The experiments
    were conducted considering different sizes for the blacklist. The higher the size
    of the blacklist, the better the communication performance. This result corroborates
    the results presented in Grsu et al. (2016). However, this type of behavior only
    occurs if an adequate monitoring of the quality of the channels is performed,
    in order to properly configure the blacklist in real-time. One limitation of the
    approach presented in Du and Roussos (2011); Du and Roussos (2013) is that only
    interference problems are considered. Other aspects that can affect the quality
    of the links are not considered, such as shadowing and fading. Besides, the channel
    quality monitoring is performed by all nodes and using time slots that could be
    used for communication, which incurs in a high overhead, and increases the latency.
    Regarding recent researches about TSCH, there are more papers about this mode
    than DSME. In IEEE Xplore database, 19 papers were found, in ScienceDirect were
    found two papers, and ACM Digital, four results were found. Some of the topics
    are related as follows: • Optimal scheduling policy for reliability and energy
    efficiency considering opportunistic forwarding at MAC and routing layers (Huynh
    et al., 2017), and energy consumption analysis of TSCH-enabled platforms for the
    IIoT (Boccadoro et al., 2016); • Decentralized broadcast-based scheduling for
    dense multi-hop TSCH networks (Municio and Latré, 2016), simple distributed scheduling
    with collision detection (Muraoka et al., 2016), and scheduling implementations
    for real WSN applications (Sempere-Paya et al., 2016); • Centralized, model-based

    evaluation of TSCH CSMA-CA algorithm (De Guglielmo et al., 2017); • Analysis of
    co-located IEEE TSCH networks regarding interference and coexistence (Ben Yaala

    scheduling policies, energy efficiency, multi-hop networks, 6TiSCH and IIoT. 3.5.3.
    Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) Few studies have addressed LLDN so far.
    This mode is intended for applications such as factory automation and robot control,
    which require very low latency and high determinism. Communication in LLDN mode
    occurs according to a structure called superframe. Each superframe starts with
    a beacon packet transmitted in broadcast by the coordinator, and it is followed
    by up to two timeslots used for management (optional). After that, several dedicated
    timeslots are defined for transmission of the end nodes. When only one node is
    associated to a timeslot, it is not necessary to use an address, since the node
    can be identified by the timeslot ID, which is already known by the coordinator.
    Therefore, it is possible to transmit smaller packets and reduce network latency.
    Different from TSCH and DSME, it does not implement EB and there is no multi-channel
    mechanism. Similar to DSME, it implements GACK, and similar to TSCH, the channel
    access is performed by dedicated time slots and uses a version of CSMA/CA in shared
    time slots. The dedicated time slots are accessed using a TDMA approach, and the
    timeslots are smaller than those used in TSCH and DSME. Differently from TSCH
    and DSME, LLDN has been designed only for star topologies, in which a number of
    nodes need periodically to send data to a central sink. Since communication takes
    place based on TDMA, communication between end nodes and the network coordinator
    (central node of star topology) is collision-free, so that it is possible to ensure
    good communication quality. However, communication channel problems related to
    shadowing, multipath, interference, or asymmetry can degrade network performance.
    In addition, due to the use of a star topology, it may be difficult to accommodate
    a network with many nodes. A possible solution to this problem is to use a multi-transceiver
    coordinator node and divide the network into groups that use a common channel.
    Strategies for link quality estimation and channel allocation that are discussed
    in Section 4.2, can be used to improve the QoS of such networks. An implementation
    of the LLDN described in Anwar et al. (2015) uses IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radios,
    and is aimed to verify the feasibility of implementing applications that require
    intervals of up to 10 ms between the reception of two new values of a sensor.
    In a scenario where the sensor nodes send 2 bytes of payload, it was possible
    to accommodate eight end nodes, with a maximum delay between the reception of
    two packets of 9.996 ms. In a scenario where the sensor nodes send 4 bytes of
    payload, it was possible to accommodate seven end nodes, with a maximum delay
    of 9.536 ms. One limitation of the analysis performed in Anwar et al. (2015) is
    that the experiments were performed in a controlled environment, without external
    interference, and with the nodes positioned very close to each other. Thus, the
    packet delivery rate was 100% throughout the experiments. In a real industrial
    environment, it may be practically impossible to achieve a packet delivery rate
    of 100%, and in this case, latency values may be worse in practice than those
    shown in the article. Some authors have proposed channel diversity techniques
    and multi-channel communication for LLDN networks. In Patti et al. (2014), a multi-channel
    protocol based on LLDN, called MC-LLDN, was proposed. MC-LLDN aims to increase
    the scalability of LLDN networks through the use of a multi-level topology (tree),
    data aggregation and communication using multiple channels. In this way, it is
    possible to accommodate simultaneous transmissions in the network, in different
    channels. With data aggregation in the routers, less timeslots need to be dedicated
    for packet forwarding to the coordinator, which causes a large reduction in latency.
    The limitation of MC-LLDN is that the channels are allocated statically to the
    subnetworks, which makes the protocol unable to cope with the variations that
    may occur in channel quality over time. The protocol proposed in Patti and Lo
    Bello (2016) is an evolution of MC-LLDN, called PriMuLa, which incorporates adaptive
    selection of channels for the subnets. One limitation of PriMuLa, which is due
    to the characteristics of LLDN networks, is that the same channel is allocated
    to all nodes on the same subnet. However, spatial variations in channel quality
    may occur, as well as asymmetry problems. In addition, to perform dynamic channel
    selection, a link quality estimation mechanism must be used that operates in real
    time and does not cause overhead on the sensor nodes. The simulations to evaluate
    PriMuLa were performed considering only shadowing problems, through the use of
    realistic parameters for the log-normal shadowing model. However, other problems
    that may affect the quality of the links, such as the non-stationarity behavior
    of the wireless channel in industrial environments, were not considered. Among
    the main modes of IEEE 802.15.4e, LLDN is the least researched, showing only three
    papers in IEEE Xplore database, one survey about IEEE 802.15.4e in which LLDN
    is discussed, presented by ScienceDirect database, and none in ACM Digital database.
    Two of them are specific about LLDN; they study priority-aware multi-channel adaptive
    framework, and tackling mobility in low latency deterministic multihop issues.
    4. Multi-channel approaches and link quality estimation Due to variations in channel
    characteristics that occur over long periods of time in industry, as discussed
    in Section 1, in order for the network to continue operating with a certain level
    of QoS in a long term, it may be necessary to employ strategies for dynamic channel
    allocation. Therefore, it is important to consider the use of multi-channel protocols
    in MAC layer, to mitigate the aforementioned problems. 4.1. Multi-channel protocols
    Multi-channel protocols can be divided into static, dynamic and semi-dynamic (Soua
    and Minet, 2015). This classification takes into account that only the sink nodes
    may have multiple transceivers. 4.1.1. Static protocols Static approaches are
    the simplest to implement, since no synchronization mechanism is required to ensure
    communication between nodes during network operation. Moreover, there is no overhead
    related to channel switching in these mechanisms. Although these protocols allow
    optimizing the network during its deployment, they are not able to adapt to variations
    in channel characteristics over time, since its configuration is performed only
    at the beginning of the network. One example of static protocol is Tree-Based
    Multi-Channel Protocol (TMCP) (Wu et al., 2008). It divides the network into disjoint
    sub-trees (or clusters), having the sink node as root. To construct the sub-trees,
    it applies a breadth-first search algorithm. After that, orthogonal channels are
    allocated to each subtree. The algorithm allows increasing the overall throughput
    by means of simultaneous transmission in different sub-trees. The drawback is
    that it is not able to eliminate the interference between nodes of the same subtree.
    In addition, dynamic variations in channel quality are not taken into account,
    and some assigned channels may present poor quality in certain periods of time,
    which would prevent the use of these channels in some moments. 4.1.2. Dynamic
    protocols In this category, the protocols use multiple channels simultaneously,
    in order to reduce collisions through scheduling strategies. These strategies
    prevent the same channel from being used at the same time slot by nodes that can
    cause interference with each other. Such protocols require a synchronization mechanism
    to ensure that the transmitter and receiver are on the same channel during the
    communication. The drawback occurs when broadcast packets are sent, and when new
    nodes are added. WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and TSCH standards use the dynamic
    approach. As an example of dynamic protocol is Y-MAC (Kim et al., 2008). It is
    a TDMA-based multi-channel MAC protocol that avoids redundant channel assignment
    by not allocating fixed channels to the nodes. When a traffic burst occurs, a
    receiver and potential senders hop to one of the other available channels, according
    to the hopping sequence. If each node has an exclusive send time slot in two-hop
    neighborhood, collision-free access to the medium is guaranteed. An alternative
    to the use of synchronization mechanisms in nodes is the asynchronous approach,
    with the use of a control channel. In this case, broadcast can also be supported
    through the control channel (Incel, 2011). This strategy has the advantage of
    not requiring clock synchronization between the sensor nodes, but presents a limitation
    due to the overhead of the negotiation process in the control channel, since periodically,
    the nodes need to listen to the control channel waiting for some message that
    indicates the start of a frame for data exchange. When nodes are waiting for control
    messages, the other channels remain idle. Another disadvantage is the bottleneck
    regarding the control channel, which may present low quality at certain moments,
    especially in dynamic environments. In dynamic protocols, usually the channel
    is chosen before each transmission. However, in order to improve the performance
    of the network, some mechanism for link quality estimation is necessary, and a
    correct management of the blacklist in each period. Link quality estimation is
    discussed in Section 4.2. 4.1.3. Semi-dynamic protocols There are several semi-dynamic
    protocols (Soua and Minet, 2015), but the most relevant and studied are MMSN (Zhou
    et al., 2006) and EM-MAC (Tang et al., 2011). The Multi-Frequency Media Access
    Control for Wireless Sensor Networks (MMSN) protocol consists of frequency assignment
    and media access aspects. The frequency assignment is used to assign different
    frequencies, or evenly allocate available frequencies if there are more neighbors
    than available frequencies, to nodes that have potential communication conflicts.
    It allows users to choose 1 of 4 available frequency assignment strategies. In
    media access design, nodes that have potential conflicts coordinate to access
    the shared physical frequencies, in a distributed way. The Dynamic Multichannel
    Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (EM-MAC) is a multichannel
    asynchronous duty-cycling MAC protocol initiated by the receiver, where a node
    sends a wake-up beacon to notify potential senders that it is awake and ready
    to receive data packets. It does not require nodes to synchronize their clocks,
    does not use a common control channel, and does not explicitly exchange channel
    and wake-up schedules. Instead, every node independently decides its own pseudo-random
    channel-switching behavior and wake-up times. In this category, channel exchange
    and simultaneous transmission in different channels are allowed, but the exchanges
    occur less frequently. In some approaches, receivers are associated to fixed channels,
    whereas transmitters change to the channel of each receiver when have packets
    to transmit. In this case, a synchronization mechanism may also be required if
    the receiver changes the channel over time. In Saifullah et al. (2014), the authors
    proposed three approaches for channel allocation in order to minimize conflicts
    among simultaneous transmissions. The first approach is based on the receiver,
    in which the channels are allocated to the receivers of the network. The second
    approach is based on the connections between the nodes, in which the channels
    are allocated for each link between two nodes, so that the same node can receive
    packets through different channels, from different transmitters. The two approaches
    aimed to make the network free from channel conflict, without interference due
    to simultaneous transmissions on the same channel. In both cases, the network
    was modeled as a graph, and an interference graph was created, in which the edges
    represent nodes that interfere with each other. After modeling the interference
    graph, an algorithm of graph coloring can be used to minimize the number of channels
    being used, in which the channels are modeled as the colors in the algorithm.
    The third approach aims to minimize the maximum level of interference at the nodes.
    This approach also uses an interference graph, and the algorithms are distributed
    and executed iteratively. The strategy first performs a static and distributed
    channel allocation phase in order to reduce collisions. After this phase, the
    protocol can work dynamically, when a connection-based approach is used. However,
    this approach has no mechanisms to adapt to dynamic variations in the network.
    4.2. Link quality estimation To maintain a certain level of QoS over long periods
    of time, it may be necessary to employ dynamic channel allocation strategies.
    The allocation must take into account the network topology to avoid neighboring
    subnets using the same or adjacent channels, and some mechanism to estimate the
    quality of the channels, since there may be spatial variations in the quality
    of the channels. Besides the ability to choose the best channel, the mechanism
    must allow fast network synchronization in case of channel switching. Experiments
    performed in Amzucu et al. (2014) with static nodes, found that a channel switch
    can lead up to 30 dB of difference in the received power. The channel quality
    estimators are the basis of several routing protocols, topology control, and dynamic
    channel allocation mechanisms (Baccour et al., 2012). In Gungor and Korkmaz (2012),
    there is an example of routing protocol that uses quality estimators, called CTP.
    It takes into account the asymmetry of the channels, and was discussed in Section
    2.3. The estimators must have good reactivity to changes and maintain good stability.
    Some of them are based on hardware through the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) and
    RSSI, others, in software (packet delivery ratio, amount of retransmissions, and
    so on). All packets received by IEEE 802.15.4 radios have an associated RSSI and
    LQI value, however RSSI can also be obtained independent of packet reception.
    In this case, the transceiver performs a channel energy scan, regardless of the
    source. Any device that generates noise and interference influences its value.
    LQI, on the other hand, can only be measured during packet reception, since its
    metric is based on the analysis of the first symbols of received packets. RSSI
    is more stable than LQI, except for very reflective environments, which present
    greater small-scale attenuation due to multipath fading (Baccour et al., 2012).
    Regarding the software-based estimators, they use information obtained from upper
    layers, such as PRR, and Required Number of Packet Transmissions (RNP). The use
    of metrics based on PRR allows a good estimation for links with a very high or
    very low quality, but presents some problems in intermediate links. When retransmission
    is used, PRR-based metrics may overestimate the link quality, since it does not
    consider the number of transmission attempts before a successful reception. RNP-based
    metrics estimate the required number of packet transmissions until a successful
    reception. The ETX and Four-Bit (FB) are examples of RNP-based estimators (Gomes
    et al., 2017b). The ETX estimator (De Couto et al., 2003) is initiated by the
    receiver, and when it estimates the PRR in both directions, it takes into consideration
    the link asymmetry. In order to calculate the PRR of the backward and forward
    links, probe broadcast packets are used, causing overhead in all nodes of the
    network and extra traffic. The FB estimator (Fonseca et al., 2007) is initiated
    by the sender and uses four bits of information. The first bit is obtained from
    the physical layer in order to identify the quality of the channel in a received
    packet. The second bit (ACK bit) is obtained from the link layer, and considers
    both forward and backward links. The last two bits are obtained from the network
    layer, and are useful for route decisions (Baccour et al., 2012). The ACK bit
    is determined using data packets and probe broadcast packets that are combined
    to compute an estimate of the ETX. The F-LQE estimator (Baccour et al., 2015)
    is initiated by the receiver and is based on fuzzy logic. It uses four metrics
    to characterize the link: packet delivery (SPRR), stability (SF), asymmetry (ASL),
    and channel quality (SNR or LQI). The first metric is the PRR filtered with an
    EWMA filter. The stability metric is the coefficient of variation of PRR. The
    third metric uses the PRR calculated in the neighbor nodes, and these values in
    each node are acquired using probe broadcast packets, and sent together with data
    packets. The calculus of SNR is performed using two values of RSSI, one sampled
    from a received packet, and other value sampled after the packet reception to
    obtain the noise floor. After that, both values are subtracted to obtain the SNR.
    The Opt-FLQE estimator (Rekik et al., 2015) is a modification of F-LQE to improve
    the reactivity and reduce the computational complexity. It uses a metric obtained
    at the sender, the Smoothed RNP (SRNP), instead of SF. The SRNP values are sent
    together with data packets to allow the receiver to calculate the Opt-FLQE metric.
    Other solution for LQE, called Lightweight Packet Error Discriminator (LPED) (Barac
    et al., 2014), uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) to perform channel diagnosis,
    and the information obtained from received data packets. LPED is capable of identifying
    fading or interference problems in the wireless channel, but does not provide
    metrics to assess the link quality in terms of a network performance indicator,
    such as PRR or RNP (Eskola and Heikkilä, 2016). This may lead the network to make
    changes in the routes or channels due to rapid variations in the quality of the
    channels, which causes instability in the protocol. The use of FEC can be useful
    also to recover some corrupted packets, but when good channels or routers are
    picked, the SNR is increased, and then the use of FEC may not be advantageous.
    In Gungor and Korkmaz (2012), a simulation study was performed to compare PRR,
    RNP, WMEWMA, ETX, and FB on the CTP protocol for smart grid environments. The
    results showed that ETX and FB presented a better performance in such harsh environments,
    since only both estimators consider the link asymmetry among the evaluated LQEs.
    In the experiments described in Baccour et al. (2015), F-LQE outperformed ETX
    and FB, and in Rekik et al. (2015), a performance analysis showed that OptFLQE
    is more reactive than F-LQE, while still being more reliable for smart grid environments.
    In Rekik et al. (2016), Opt-FLQE was compared to ETX and FB on the RPL routing
    protocol for smart-grid environments, and the simulations showed that Opt-FLQE
    outperformed ETX and FB for all evaluated metrics. In Gomes et al., 2017b the
    authors proposed a Link Quality Estimator (LQE) for IWSN, and a new type of node,
    the LQE node, that estimates the link quality in real-time, using RSSI, and information
    obtained from received data packets. The proposed LQE is capable of capturing
    the effects of multipath, interference, and link asymmetry. Experiments were performed
    in a real industrial environment using IEEE 802.15.4 radios, and models were developed
    to allow the use of RSSI samples to proper estimate the link quality. A comparison
    was performed with the Opt-FLQE, and the results showed that the estimator described
    in Gomes et al., 2017b is more accurate and reactive for the type of environment
    in study. Different from other LQEs in literature, in the proposed LQE the sensor
    nodes do not need to send broadcast probe packets. Besides, using the LQE node,
    the other nodes of the WSN do not need to stop their operation to monitor the
    link quality. In this solution, no overhead is imposed on the end nodes, and there
    is no dependence on the size of the packets, as in LPED, for example. 5. WSN platforms,
    operating systems and simulators The terms sensor node, Wireless Node (WN), Smart
    Dust, mote, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mote are used somewhat interchangeably
    in the industry; the most general terms used here are sensor node and mote. The
    sensor nodes usually have one or more sensor units, a power supply run by batteries
    or connected to the power distribution company, a processing unit used to handle
    onboard data processing/storage/encryption/digital modulation, a transceiver,
    which combines radio transmitter/receiver, and is connected to the antenna, as
    depicted in Fig. 16(a). Download : Download high-res image (263KB) Download :

    Sohraby et al. (2007). The processors in wireless sensors are commonly referred
    as microcontrollers (MCU), and some of the characteristics why these MCU are especially
    suited to embedded systems are their flexibility in connecting with other devices
    (like sensors), their instruction set enabled to time-critical signal processing,
    and their typically low power consumption. In addition, they are freely programmable
    and hence very flexible (Karl and Willig, 2005). Besides these characteristics,
    MCU have the ability to reduce their power consumption by going into sleep states
    where only parts of the controller are active. MCU that are used in several wireless
    sensor node prototypes include the Atmel processor or Texas Instrument''s MSP430
    (Instruments, 2004). Table 2 shows some examples and characteristics of MCU from
    both Atmel and Texas Instruments. Table 2. WSN Platforms and characteristics.

    TinyOS/Contiki TinyOS/Contiki Concerning the transceiver, currently popular product
    series include, for example, the RFM TR1001, the Chipcon CC1000 and CC2420, and
    the Infineon TDA525x family. The TR1000 family of radio transceivers from RF Monolithics
    is available for the 916 MHz and 868 MHz frequency range. It is intended for short-range
    radio communication with up to 115.2 kbps (Monolithics, 2000). Mica motes use
    RFM TR1000 transceiver and contain a set of hardware accelerators. Chipcon CC1000
    operates between 300 and 1000 MHz, programmable in steps of 250 Hz. It uses FSK
    as modulation, provides RSSI, and has programmable output power. It is possible
    to use it in frequency hopping protocols (Instruments, 2009). CC2420 (Instruments,
    2014) implements PHY layer as prescribed by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with the
    required support for the MAC of this standard. The transceiver operates in 2.4
    GHz band and features the required DSSS modem, resulting in a data rate of 250
    kbps. The Infineon TDA 525x family provides flexible, single-chip, energy-efficient
    transceivers. Naturally, embedded software has to fulfill resource requirements,
    and the requirements are related to constraints such as limited memory consumption,
    available computing power, consumable energy, power dissipation, and so on. Embedded
    systems can be programmed in a wide variety of languages like assembly, C, C++,
    and Java. They differ in many aspects, such as the abstraction level at which
    the program is written and with that the granularity of control over the processor.
    Connected to the hardware of the sensor nodes, there are the following main software
    subsystems, as depicted in Fig. 16(b): • Operating System (OS): designed to run
    on types of devices that are severely constrained in memory, power, processing
    power, and communication bandwidth. Contiki and TinyOS are two examples of this
    kind of OS. Contiki is an open source OS for IoT, and connects tiny low-cost,
    low-power microcontrollers to the Internet. TinyOS is an open source, BSD-licensed
    operating system designed for low-power wireless devices. It provides useful software
    abstractions, also called Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), of the underlying
    device hardware (Amjad et al., 2016). Table 3 describes the OS for resource-constrained
    devices; Table 3. Operating systems. Name Architecture Scheduler Model Supported

    are the software modules that manage basic functions of the sensor, and the details
    of the radio channel transmission link, including clocking and synchronization,
    signal encoding, bit recovery, bit counting, signal levels, and modulation transceivers;
    • Mini-applications: data processing, signal-value storage and manipulation applications.
    They are supported at the node level for in-network processing; • Communication
    Processors: manage the communication functions, including routing, packet buffering
    and forwarding, topology maintenance, medium access control and encryption. 5.1.
    Operating systems This section analyzes existing WSN operating system, and the
    following list presents the main OS used for WSN: 5.1.1. TinyOS It is one of the
    first OS specifically designed for WSN. Its architecture consists of a scheduler
    and a set of connected components (Dargie and Poellabauer, 2010). Components are
    classified into configuration components and modules. The former specifies how
    two or more modules are connected with each other, and the latter are the basic
    building blocks of a TinyOS program. The composition of multiple configurations
    into a single executable code produces a TinyOS application. In TinyOS, scheduled
    tasks are based on FIFO principle, and TinyOS architecture is effective for tasks
    that are of short duration. Resource allocation in TinyOS is optimized by adopting
    a static memory allocation, which avoids the extra overhead associated with dynamic
    allocation. 5.1.2. Contiki It is another open source OS specifically designed
    for WSN. The Contiki kernel is event-driven like TinyOS, and the system includes
    protothreads that provide a thread-like programming abstraction but with a very
    small memory overhead. Protothreads in Contiki are a combination of some features
    of events and threads. They can be viewed as lightweight (stackless) threads,
    but they can also be viewed as interruptible tasks in event-based programming
    (Dunkels et al., 2006). Contiki provides IP communication, both for IPv4 and IPv6.
    The uIP embedded IP stack is used by hundreds of companies in systems such as
    freighter ships, satellites and oil drilling equipment. The idea of using IP communication
    in low-power WSN has led to an IETF standard and an international industry alliance
    - IP for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance (IPSO Alliance - promoting the use of IP
    for Smart Objects8). One of the interesting features of the Contiki OS is its
    support of dynamic loading and reconfiguration of services. This is achieved by
    defining services, service interfaces, service stubs, and a service layer. Services
    are to Contiki what modules are to TinyOS (Dargie and Poellabauer, 2010). Contiki
    includes several add-ons and libraries providing communication functionalities
    (Watteyne et al., 2012). The most relevant is the ContikiMAC (Dunkels,), a CSMA/CA
    preamble-sampling MAC using periodical wake-ups to listen for packet transmissions
    from neighbors. The μIPv6 library provides 6LoWPAN and RPL routing functionality.
    The transport layer implements both UDP and a lightweight version of TCP. Contiki
    also implements CoAP, similar to OpenWSN. 5.1.3. OpenWSN Another example of OS
    is Berkeley OpenWSN (Watteyne et al., 2012) which have primarily implemented their
    proposed communication protocols in TinyOS. Berkeley OpenWSN is an open source
    stack intending to implement low-power wireless standards such as IEEE 802.15.4e,
    6LoWPAN, RPL and CoAP. It is rooted in the new IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH. Among the
    platforms that can run OpenWSN are GINA (AT86RF231), TelosB (CC2420), LPC (AT86RF231),
    and K20 (AT86RF231). The micro-controller of the first two platforms are developed
    by Texas Instruments, and the last two are NXP and Freescale, respectively. 5.1.4.
    RIOT It was developed with focus on the requirements of IoT (Baccelli et al.,
    2013). RIOT is a microkernel-based RTOS with multi-threading support, using an
    architecture inherited from FireKernel (Will et al., 2009). The OS is written
    in C and the applications and libraries are implemented in C++. RIOT features
    several network stacks, including its own implementation of the full 6LoWPAN stack
    (GNRC stack), a port of the 6TiSCH stack OpenWSN, and a port of the information
    centric networking stack CCN-lite (Hahm et al.) 5.2. Network simulators There
    is a number of network simulators (Wehrle et al., 2010) developed for several
    environments. The four main simulators that support simulation of LR-WPAN are
    described in this section. They are very used in the literature because of the
    resources provided. They are TOSSIM, COOJA, NS2/NS3 and OMNeT++. Regarding OMNeT++,
    this paper gives a special attention to one of its frameworks, Castalia, because
    of its realistic model based on CC2420 and CC1000 radio transceivers, and the
    wireless channel model developed by the authors of this survey to simulate IWSN.
    5.2.1. TOSSIM It is a simulator with the specific goal of transparently running
    TinyOS applications (Wehrle et al., 2010). The component-oriented software architecture
    of TinyOS supports integration into a simulator, in which a hardware abstraction
    is provided by software components with specific interfaces, which are enforced
    at compile time. The simulation is event-driven and radio communication is modeled
    with bit error rates for each uni-directional link. The radio model is quite simplistic,
    not describing accurately interference caused by simultaneous transmissions. The
    simulator is also missing some other features such as mobility models. 5.2.2.
    COOJA It is a WSN simulator based on the Contiki OS. It is a Java-based simulator
    that executes native code by making Java Native Interface (JNI) calls from the
    Java environment to a compiled Contiki system. COOJA provides both the OS emulation
    and the instruction set emulation in a single framework. The MSPSim (Eriksson
    et al., 2009) is used as the instruction set simulator, and is also written in
    Java. It supports the Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller and includes some
    hardware peripherals such as sensor, communication ports, LEDs, and sound devices.
    5.2.3. NS2/NS3 NS2 is an event-driven object-oriented network simulator whose
    simulations are realized in C++ language and object-oriented Tcl (OTcl). The NS3
    simulator is an improvement of NS2, and is, as its predecessor, developed in the
    C++ but OTcl is neglected in favor of C++ (network models) and the Python language
    (optional). NS3 is a robust simulator developed for Internet systems, but it does
    not have very large focus on the lower layers of the protocols stack. NS3 has
    a LR-WPAN project in constant development9 to simulate WSN. It has several models
    implemented, including 6LoWPAN, RPL models. 5.2.4. OMNeT++ The Objective Modular
    Network Testbed simulation environment is an open-source discrete-event tool based
    on C++ and used for the simulations of communication networks, multiprocessors,
    and various distributed systems. It consists of modules that communicate with
    each other using message passing. Simple modules can be grouped together to form
    more complex compound modules. A user defines the structure of a module using
    OMNeT++ topology description language NED. It is often quoted as a discrete event
    simulator, but in fact, it is a software that supports various simulation models
    and frameworks such as the INET Framework, MiXiM and Castalia. Model frameworks
    are developed independent of the simulation framework, and follow their own release
    cycles. • INET Framework is an open-source communication networks simulation package,
    which contains models for several Internet protocols: UDP, TCP, SCTP, IP, IPv6,
    Ethernet, PPP, IEEE 802.11, MPLS, OSPF, and others. The INET Framework also contains
    emulation capabilities; • MiXiM supports wireless and mobile simulations. It provides
    detailed models of the wireless channel (fading, etc.), wireless connectivity,
    mobility models, models for obstacles and many communication protocols especially
    at the MAC level. Furthermore, it provides a user-friendly graphical representation
    of wireless and mobile networks, and supports debugging; • Castalia is a simulator
    for WSN, Body Area Networks and generally, networks of low-power embedded devices.
    Researchers and developers can use it to test their distributed algorithms and
    protocols in a realistic wireless channel and radio model (CC1000 and CC2420).
    Castalia uses the log-normal shadowing model as one of the ways to model average
    path loss. It also models temporal variation of path loss as an effort to capture
    fading phenomena in changing environments. Considering simulators with focus on
    industrial environments, some papers described simulation studies of IWSN (Du
    et al., 2015, Alderisi et al., 2015), but none of them considered the non-stationary
    characteristics of the wireless channel for a long term, neither the uncorrelation
    between different channels. In Gomes et al. (2017a), it is described a simple
    and reliable model to simulate multi-channel protocols for IWSN that captures
    the effects of fading, shadowing, and the non-stationary characteristics of the
    channel. It also considers the differences in the characteristics of the different
    channels, and the asymmetry of the links. In Gomes et al. (2017a), the MAC protocols
    CSMA/CA and TSCH were evaluated using the proposed model. It was integrated into
    the open source simulator Castalia. 6. Systematic mapping of IWSN researches WSNs
    are becoming increasingly popular, especially in industrial environments. Several
    researches have been conducted to investigate such environments and the standards
    used to improve the QoS, as discussed in the previous sections. According to Google
    Trends, depicted in Fig. 17, the term ZigBee, if compared to the other terms of
    standards, WirelessHART, 802.15.4e, and ISA100.11a, is by far the most researched
    term in Google tool, but it has been decreasing in interest since its peak in
    March 2005, as depicted in Fig. 17a). ZigBee was conceived in 1998, standardized
    in 2003, and revised in 2006. In a comparison shown in this Figure, the other
    standards do not even appear in the graphic. Download : Download high-res image

    WirelessHART, 802.15.4e, ISA100.11a, and ZigBee. When ZigBee is removed from the
    graph, the other standards can be easily visualized in Fig. 17b). It can be seen
    that, like ZigBee, WirelessHART has been decreasing in interest as a search term
    since June 2010. This graph also shows when the three standards began to be researched
    with WirelessHART in April 2007, 802.15.4e and ISA100.11a standards around March
    2008. Officially presented in July 2009, ISA100.11a has not drawn the attention
    of researchers as much as WirelessHART, and officially presented in 2007, WirelessHART
    remains as one of the main standards researched. Since IEEE 802.15.4e defines
    improvements of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, it tends to draw more attention of researchers
    in the future, going against the decline of the other standards. Regarding scientific
    research, usually when trying to perform it, a researcher starts his work conducting
    primary studies, which is an empirical study that investigates a specific question.
    In the next step, the researcher leaves for secondary study, which reviews all
    primary studies related to a specific research question, in order to integrate
    and synthetize the evidence related to a specific research question. A systematic
    mapping is a form of secondary study performed to obtain a comprehensive overview
    of a given research topic, identify research gaps, and collect evidences to commission
    future research. Being a widespread methodology in areas such as medicine, the
    first works in systematic mapping connected to information technology emerged
    with software engineering. The first step to start this kind of study is setting
    a topic to be mapped, and then identifying the research questions. Based on these
    questions, one must create search strings and submit them to scientific search
    engines. The results must be analyzed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria
    defined in the study protocols. The last step is the classification of the works
    following a predefined taxonomy displaying results in graphs and tables. In order
    to achieve this goal, studies published in recent journals, and conferences available
    at three relevant electronic databases were collected and analyzed, namely: IEEE
    Xplore, ScienceDirect, and ACM Digital. The protocol is organized as follows:
    • Setting Scheme: in this case, the theme was set to ”industrial wireless sensor
    networks”; • Search Strings: for this mapping, the automatic search process is
    used. The semantics used for the search was: ((“Abstract”: industrial wireless
    sensor networks) AND industry industrial wireless). The papers lists are stored,
    and the results are listed in Table 4; Table 4. Results found in each database.

    • Steps (S): the filtering is performed in two steps. In the first step (S1),
    the title, abstract and keywords are analyzed according to the search string.
    Once this step is concluded, the second step (S2) is regarding a full analysis
    of the paper, and takes into consideration the selection criteria listed as follows;
    • Selection Criteria: they were used to evaluate each retrieved primary study.
    The main goal is the inclusion of potentially relevant studies to answer the Research
    Questions (RQ), and exclude those that are irrelevant, duplicated, and not written
    in English. These selection criteria were used to filter the papers in the second
    step (S2). The following Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (IC and EC) were considered:IC:
    papers that present studies about IWSN and experiments inside this environment
    regarding the communication issues;EC1: papers that do not present results and
    do not have industry as the main concern;EC2: subjects and technologies that were
    not discussed in this paper, such as Multimedia Sensor Networks, Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN), Big Data, Cloud Computing, Wireless Nano Sensor Networks, Open
    Communication protocol for Ad hoc Reliable industrial Instrumentation (OCARI),
    industrial control systems which use Network Control System (NCS) and Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Data-muling, Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA), DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications), Crowdsourcing-based
    Industrial Sensing Intelligence (CISI), energy harvesting systems, technologies
    unsuitable for industrial monitoring such as Bluetooth, 802.11, and Arduino, general-purpose
    security issues, and connection to wired systems;EC3: automation applications
    cover a broad domain from industrial automation, home automation to automation
    in body area networks, and have specific real-time requirements differing from
    each other depending on the criticality of the application. Therefore, all the
    issues regarding automation applications are excluded, except for the industrial
    applications;EC4: underwater monitoring has been extensively researched, but since
    this environment is outdoor and differs from the common industrial environment,
    it is excluded;EC5: studies that are table of contents, tutorial, editorial, keynote
    talk, Ph.D. forum abstract, or summary of conference. • Research Questions (RQ):
    RQ1 - How are the distributed publications over the years about IWSN, considering
    S1 papers? RQ2 - Who are the researchers with the largest amount of published
    works, considering S1 papers? RQ3 - Which are the main Journals and Conferences
    that publish most papers about IWSN, considering S1 papers? Considering S2 papers,
    the following RQ were defined: RQ4 - Which are the main standards used in IWSN?
    RQ5 - Which type of analysis is performed by the papers, experiments, simulations,
    or both? Among the simulators used, which are the most used? RQ6 - Regarding the
    devices and OS, which are the most used? Although the mentioned standards are
    used in industry and most of them were designed for this environment, not always
    the papers have this environment as focus, so those that did not consider the
    research in it were discarded. The first RQ relates to the distribution of publications
    over the years. In Fig. 18, it is shown that researches about IWSN began around
    2004. The original version of 802.15.4 PHY was developed in 2003, with revisions
    from 2006. The peak in 2016 of papers published can be explained because of improvements
    regarding the IEEE 802.15.4-2011 standard, and the new concepts of IoT and IIoT.
    The concept of IIoT in manufacturing came up, and leads to the fourth industrial
    revolution, the so-called Industry 4.0 (smart factory), which in 2013 had its
    final report presented. Although seven articles were found in 2017, they were
    not included in this chart because the year has not yet been finalized. Download

    Papers published per year about IWSN after S1. The RQ2 is regarding the researchers
    who most published papers in literature about IWSN, and the result is illustrated
    in Table 5. According to the search string, the authors are listed ordered by
    the number of contributions. This list is limited to 16 researchers, but it does
    not mean that other authors have not contributed somehow, and does not mean that
    some of them are more important than the others, but this list aims to help other
    researchers to draw their studies to the research object in question. In addition,
    the listed authors may have contributed with other papers not filtered in this
    systematic mapping. The results intend only to create a statistical view of researches
    developed and their authors. Table 5. Number of contributions by author. Researcher

    used standards in industrial environments, and ZigBee leads the list, followed
    by WirelessHART. This can be explained because ZigBee is much older than WirelessHART,
    since in 2007 it was the main standard researched. Although the massive use of
    ZigBee, in Barac et al. (2015) new researches found that none of those standards
    were able to deal with industrial applications with stringent timing requirements.
    To overcome this problem, IEEE 802.15.4e was developed, and it is shown in third
    place after WirelessHART. The study of IEEE 802.15.4e tends to increase along
    the years because of its strategies to deal with Multipath Fading and Attenuation
    (MFA) and interference requirements. Download : Download high-res image (128KB)

    RQ5, according to Fig. 20 a), most papers performed simulations more than experiments.
    Only 13% performed experiments after simulations, in order to corroborate with
    the results presented by the simulations. More important than simulations, the
    experiments have the ability to validate in real environments or with real devices,
    the implementation of the proposed solution. When considering the simulations,
    Fig. 20b) depicts the main used simulators. It is shown that Matlab, OPNET and
    NS2, followed by QualNet, Simulink and OMNeT++ are the most used tools to simulate
    protocols and environments for IWSNs. Matlab allows implementation of algorithms
    and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, etc.,
    so it is very used across industry and academia. Download : Download high-res

    by the papers and main simulators used in them. In the case of papers, instead
    of NS3, the most used version is its previous one. This can be explained by some
    reasons: the latest version of NS2 was released in late 2011 (2.35) with several
    improvements, and remains in active use and maintained; the differences between
    NS2 and NS3 are numerous, and NS2 scripts do not run within NS3. Therefore, for
    researchers that are used to NS2, changing to NS3 requires study and adaptation,
    which is not always possible in a short time. Although NS3 has improved models,
    NS2 still remains as a good option to test models and algorithms. OPNET was a
    software business that provided performance management for computer networks and
    applications. Its company was founded in 1986 and went public in 2000. In October
    2012, OPNET was acquired by Riverbed Technology. Prior this acquisition, it had
    an OPNET Modeler (now Riverbed Modeler), a software tool for computer network
    modeling and simulation. Since the tool is not free-of-charge, it was not included
    in this paper. Regarding the devices and OS asked in RQ6, depicted in Fig. 21,
    the most used platforms are TelosB, CC2420, MicaZ, IRIS and Tmote Sky. Several
    platforms features Chipcon CC2420 radio by Texas Instruments for wireless communications,
    such as Tmote Sky, Zolertia Z1, MicaZ, TelosB, and others, but some papers that
    used it were not specific in defining which exact platforms they used, so it was
    separated when the platform was not explicit. Concerning the OS, TinyOS is by
    large the most popular OS for IWSN because of its support for several platforms.
    Contiki, which is the second of the list, is more suitable for IIoT, and since
    there are several papers with focus on real-time communications, FreeRTOS also
    appeared in the list. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download

    7. Discussion There are many studies about the IWSN challenges, which have been
    discussed in the previous sections. In this section, some examples of potential
    approaches to deal with the challenges are discussed. Some of the approaches are
    as follows: 7.1. Resource constraints UWB (Ultra-WideBand) is a form of radio
    transmission that creates short pulses of low-energy radiation (Zeng et al., 2015).
    The width of the pulse gives it the property of generating radio energy over a
    wide frequency range, with very low energy, at any frequency. This allows UWB
    to overlap other radio bands such as Wi-Fi and the other services in the 2.4 GHz
    ISM band without interfering. Generally, other radio modulation schemes such as
    DSSS will see UWB as just impulse noise, which they easily filter out. Since UWB
    uses pulses, it is capable of being detected over a much longer range than other
    signal forms. Pulses signals also tend to penetrate solid objects better than
    continuous wave signals. Low-energy radiation requires less transmit power and
    results in longer battery life for battery-powered devices. The peculiar characteristics
    of the UWB radio technique offer new solutions and opportunities for industrial
    wireless application (Paso et al., 2013). Other important topic regarding resource
    constraints is the cooperation mechanism to reduce energy consumption at the cost
    of an acceptable reduced throughput. TDMA-based multihop mesh networks with cooperation
    mechanism is an example of approach that has not been much researched (Iqbal et
    al., 2017). The use of data aggregation is another research topic to be explored
    (Dobslaw et al., 2015). It significantly improves the end-to-end contention and
    energy efficiency compared to single packet transmissions. In combination with
    techniques such as redundant relays, re-transmission, hybrid and hierarchical
    network structures, multiple channel communication and slot-reuse, data aggregation
    can play a crucial role in making wireless networks for industrial applications
    practically feasible. 7.2. Dynamic topologies and dynamic solutions When considering
    the dynamic characteristics of industrial environments, it is important to think
    about dynamic solutions to guarantee the quality of communications (Collotta et
    al., 2012). There are researches about dynamic and distributed topology control
    with self-organizing properties, and decentralized dynamic topology control algorithms
    capable to construct tree-based topologies for use in performance critical applications.
    Other options are regarding dynamically allocated GTS slots, dynamic time division
    multiple access, and dynamically update sampling times. The first one can be configured
    to deal with sporadic and periodic events. With the use of an implicit decision
    used in deallocation/deflation, the control traffic is kept low resulting in low
    battery consumption. The second one considers a cluster topology, and in the inter-cluster
    part, a quick assign algorithm and a dynamic maximum link algorithm can be developed
    to meet the quick networking or minimum frame size requirements. The last one
    intends to ensure a better possible management of critical situations regardless
    of network protocol (since it may work at application level of protocol stack)
    and topology used. Other issue regarding dynamic solutions to provide reliability
    is the creation of redundant links dynamically. An example of a protocol that
    provides redundancy for industrial applications is RWCP (Reliable Wireless Communication
    Protocol) (Yu and Feng, 2009). 7.3. Real-time constraints Several papers address
    real-time constraints in IWSN. When errors or exceptions occur, high-criticality
    flows must be guaranteed reliably and in real time, and only a few works focus
    on mixed-criticality industrial systems. In this case, one option to solve this
    problem is optimizing the scheduling policy of mixed criticality IWSN. Other option
    is using an end-to-end delay analysis approach for fixed priority scheduling in
    mixed criticality in standards such as WirelessHART networks, which can be used
    to determine whether all flows can be delivered to destinations within their deadline.
    Other research direction is the creation of a real-time multi-channel process
    control monitoring system, such as in Blevins et al. (2015). Some papers propose
    multi-channel process monitoring algorithms that brings a balance between timeliness
    and throughput by increasing in number of operating channels. Regarding clustering
    strategy to deal with real-time constraints, one alternative is partitioning a
    network into a nonfixed number of nonoverlapping clusters according to the communication
    network topology and measurements distribution. 7.4. Security There are not much
    studies in the literature related to security issues in IWSN. Many industrial
    applications including equipment monitoring, environment monitoring, and industrial
    automation may be susceptible to different kinds of attacks. The peculiarities
    of industrial networks restrict the use of classical approaches to security (Cheminod
    et al., 2013). The cognition and reconfigurability of cognitive radios central
    to their functioning introduce a new class of security concerns distinct to those
    evident in conventional wireless networks (Fragkiadakis et al., 2013). Ensuring
    reliability and providing adequate security in these crucial services provided
    by WSNs will reinforce their acceptability as a viable and dependable technology
    in the factory and industrial domain. 7.5. Quality of service Since sensor data
    are typically time-sensitive, it is important to receive the data at the sink
    in a timely manner. Several are the researches intended to maintain QoS of communications
    in IWSNs. Some study adaptive frequency hopping approaches that allow IWSN to
    switch cognitively working channels for high transmission reliability. Adaptive
    frequency hopping (AFH) is a good topic to be researched, since it reduces the
    probability of inefficient frequency hopping, e.g., hopping from good channels
    to bad ones. Other topic is autonomous channel switching design, in which each
    accessed sensor autonomously equalizes the local channel occupations within its
    range of spectrum sensing without overhead on exchanging the sensors’ spectrum
    sensing reports. Other works study synchronization protocols, such as Flooding
    Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), and tighter time synchronization. The first
    one has high synchronization precision in WSN, and can be improved according to
    the characteristics of IWSN. The second one gives less latency, better bandwidth
    utilization, less jitter on the application. Regarding cluster topologies, one
    issue to be studied is the optimized aggregators selection problem. Clustering
    sensor nodes is an effective technique to achieve in-network aggregation in WSN,
    and the selection of a few aggregators from the sensor nodes can significantly
    reduce the data collection cost. Other research topics to guarantee QoS are delay-aware
    scheduling algorithms, and link state dependent scheduling, such as in Hong et
    al. (2015). The first one adds time slots for retransmission to each link in order
    to satisfy required reliability. Furthermore, by sharing retransmission slots
    among different flows, the method achieves the required reliability and forwarding
    delay while suppressing increase in the number of allocated slots. The second
    one allows the nodes to gather samples of the channel quality in order to generate
    prediction sets from the sample sets in independent slots. Using the prediction
    sets, nodes only wake up to transmit/receive during scheduled slots that are predicted
    to be clear and sleep during scheduled slots that may potentially cause a transmitted
    signal to fade. 8. Conclusion In this paper, an overview of the most relevant
    technologies and the various facts (configurability) concerning the deployment
    of WSN in harsh environments has been performed. Among such a kind of environments,
    the industrial one is one of the most relevant due to the increasing role of WSNs
    in industry. Furthermore, the analysis has taken into account the experiments
    and simulation results to discuss the various issues which particularly appear
    in IWSN. First, the paper discusses some general facts regarding IWSN such as
    layers and protocols as an introduction, to the particular case of the various
    standards used in IWSN. Then the discussion focuses on the most extended and used
    standards in IWSN with special emphasis on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and its
    amendment IEEE 802.15.4e. One of the particularities of ISWN is the channel behavior
    that suffers from various typical disturbances: interference from other systems
    operating in the same band, deep multipath fading, noise and shadowing strong
    attenuation. Given such a harsh transmission media, appropriate protocols should
    be developed to improve the network reliability and reach the maximum network
    throughput while preserving a moderate power consumption although this is not
    the main constraint but channel availability and reliability. One of the main
    conclusion that can be drawn from the research shown in this paper is that DSME
    protocol is a good alternative to implement IWSN if compared to the beacon-enabled
    mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Although it is based on the latter, some improvements
    have been included, such as the use of multiple channels in the CFP (GTS). The
    best protocol to choose depends on the application requirements. For example,
    for applications that require very low latencies, the use of LLDN mode and star
    topology may be more appropriate. When comparing the performance of DSME vs. TSCH
    in IWSN, the first one shows a slightly better performance, lower energy consumption
    and higher spectral efficiency. On the other hand, TSCH performance is improved
    when using adaptive frequency hopping to avoid the use of channels affected by
    interferences (with low quality). Another relevant issue in the development of
    ISWN is the use of the appropriate OS. While TelosB remains as a good choice in
    the development and deployment of IWSN other OS like Contiki, which is gaining
    popularity because it supports dynamic loading and reconfiguration of services,
    and OpenWSN are being increasingly used in ISWN implementation. A key parameter
    that characterizes an OS for ISWN is the low-power operation. An ISWN implementation
    should take into consideration some performance parameters, among them the required
    bandwidth and transmission power. The lower the transmit power the longer the
    battery life. Protocols and media access impact the required transmit power. TDMA-based
    multihop mesh networks with cooperation mechanism seems to be a proper framework
    for this goal. An IWSN shows dynamic characteristics, which are typical in industrial
    environments. In consequence, in order to optimize the overall network throughput
    and guarantee a high reliability appropriate dynamic topologies and dynamic solutions
    are required. The most common techniques are dynamically allocating GTS slots,
    dynamic time division multiple access, and dynamically update sampling times.
    The most appropriate solution depends on several network parameters. Currently,
    real-time constraints focus on mixed-criticality industrial systems. Various solutions
    have been developed where the which showed to be more effective are optimizing
    the scheduling policy and the end-to-end delay analysis approach for fixed priority
    scheduling. Security is a critical service in ISWN. The use of new and flexible
    protocols provides cognition and reconfigurability of cognitive radios central
    to their functioning, which introduces a new class of security challenges. Acknowledgment

    network protection (Luvisotto et al., 2019; Aalsalem et al., 2018; Queiroz et

  description: In order to measure, process and upload soil sample data real-timely,
    wireless automatic soil sample remote monitoring system was developed. The system
    was mainly made up of soil sample information monitoring network node and remote
    server, sensor node based on ZigBee network protocols made up of wireless sensor
    network on a small scale, and then communicates with internet using 3G at large
    scales. The whole system finishes automatically collecting soil samples, wireless
    communications and rightly orienting. The management software on remote server
    is developed based on Access and Microsoft visual C++. The software contains four
    parts, soil sample information real-time displaying, and historical data inquiry
    and displaying, soil moisture distribution map, fertilization & irrigation guidance.
    Several physical tests were done, it included the communication test between RFID
    and Zigbee, Zigbee and 3G, also some tests of sensor node. After RFID reader reading
    data from labels, user check if all information is got on remote server to test
    if wireless and 3G communications work well. Sensor node tests were done to make
    sure that the communication between Zigbee network and 3G network works well.
    All Test result shows that the communication of the system is stable. The whole
    system can support soil sampling based on GPS and fertilization information collecting,
    saving and management, which greatly increased quality and efficiency of soil
    sampling and fertilization. And also GIS and wireless communication can integrated
    with the system, so the system can realize filed work guidance based on GIS, data
    remote isochronous transfer, displaying and analyzing.

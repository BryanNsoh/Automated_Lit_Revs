    \ robotics have transformed many industries and \naspects of human life due to\
    \ rapid technological \nadvancement. IoT systems connect physical devices and\
    \ \nobjects to the internet to collect and exchange data [1],[2]. At \nthe same\
    \ time, AI and Robotics allow them to intelligently \nprocess and analyse the\
    \ data and act autonomously[3]. IoT, \nAI, and Robotics have created exciting\
    \ opportunities in \nhealthcare, transportation, agriculture, smart cities, and\
    \ \nindustrial automation. AI and robotics Fog/Cloud-based IoT \nsystems face\
    \ significant security and privacy issues [4]. \nFog/Cloud computing is used in\
    \ IoT architectures due to the \nrapid growth of IoT devices and data. Fog computing,\
    \ which \nextends Cloud services to the network edge near the data \nsource, has\
    \ enabled real-time data processing, reduced \nlatency, and increased bandwidth\
    \ efficiency [5]. This \nparadigm shift has enabled the integration of AI and\
    \ Robotics \n*Corresponding author. Email: kdkirandeep@gmail.com\ninto IoT systems,\
    \ enabling devices to make intelligent \ndecisions and perform tasks without Cloud\
    \ infrastructure [6]. \nIoT, AI, and Robotics offer promising opportunities and\
    \ \ncomplex security and privacy issues. Distributed data \nprocessing, \nheterogeneous\
    \ \ndevices, \nand \nwireless \ncommunication \nmake \nFog/Cloud-based \nIoT \n\
    systems \nvulnerable to attacks [7],[8]. Unauthorized access, data \nbreaches,\
    \ and cyber-attacks on interconnected devices can \ncause data theft, service\
    \ disruption, and even physical harm \nin critical applications[9]. \nThis paper\
    \ addresses security and privacy issues related to \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems\
    \ and AI/Robotics. These \ntechnologies must be robustly protected from potential\
    \ threats \nas they become more widespread [10], [11]. This research \ncould improve\
    \ the trustworthiness and reliability of \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems, promoting\
    \ the widespread \nadoption of IoT, AI, and Robotics across various domains \n\
    [12],[13]. \nEAI Endorsed Transactions on \nAI and Robotics\nP. D. Singh and K.\
    \ D. Singh\n2 \n2. Fog/Cloud-based IoT Architectures for\nAI and Robotics\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) has changed how devices and \npeople interact. A vast\
    \ network of sensors, actuators, and \nsmart devices collect and exchange data\
    \ via the internet in \nIoT. The traditional Cloud computing model struggles to\
    \ \nmanage the massive amount of data generated by IoT \napplications as they\
    \ grow in scale and complexity. As a \ncomplement to Cloud computing, Fog computing\
    \ allows real-\ntime processing and analysis of IoT data [14]. \nFog computing,\
    \ or Edge computing, brings Cloud computing \ncloser to data sources and IoT devices.\
    \ Decentralizing \ncomputation, storage, and networking reduces latency and \n\
    improves system efficiency. Unlike cloud computing, Fog \ncomputing processes\
    \ and analyses data at the network's edge \nusing edge devices, access points,\
    \ and servers [15]. \nKey Fog/Cloud-based IoT Architecture Components \nFog/Cloud-based\
    \ IoT architectures depend on them. These \ndevices measure temperature, humidity,\
    \ light, and motion \nusing sensors. The Fog and Cloud nodes process data \ncollected\
    \ by IoT devices. Fog nodes connect IoT devices to \nCloud data centres [16].\
    \ Edge servers, routers, and gateways \nare placed near IoT devices or critical\
    \ network points. Fog \nnodes aggregate and preprocess IoT device data, reducing\
    \ \nlatency and network congestion. Local data analysis allows \nreal-time decision-making\
    \ without the Cloud The advantages \nof developing robotics with the integration\
    \ of Fog/Cloud with \nIoT are shown in Figure 1. \nCloud data centres store and\
    \ process massive amounts of IoT \ndata from multiple Fog nodes and devices. Cloud\
    \ data centres \nhave \npowerful \ncomputing, \nstorage, \nand \nprocessing \n\
    capabilities. They perform intensive data analytics, machine \nlearning algorithms,\
    \ and data storage that may not be feasible \nor efficient at the Fog layer [17].\
    \ \n3. Cloud/Fog IoT Architecture Workflow\nTypical Fog/Cloud-based IoT architecture\
    \ workflow: \nSensor-equipped IoT devices gather environmental data. The \napplication\
    \ can generate data in real-time or periodically.  \n3.1 Local Fog Layer Preprocessing\
    \ \n Nearby Fog nodes preprocess and analyse the collected data. \nFog nodes filter,\
    \ aggregate, and process data, removing \nirrelevant or unimportant data. Local\
    \ processing reduces \nCloud data transmission, saving network bandwidth. \n3.2\
    \ Data Transmission \nSecure channels send pre-processed data to Cloud data \n\
    centres. This data transmission provides Cloud data centres \nwith relevant data\
    \ for analysis and decision-making. \n3.3 Cloud-based Processing and Analysis\
    \ \nCloud data centres use machine learning algorithms and \nadvanced data analytics\
    \ to gain insights from large data sets. \nCloud layers can manage computationally\
    \ intensive tasks that \nFog layers cannot. \nData analysis yields actionable\
    \ insights or commands. The \nFog layer distributes these insights and commands\
    \ to IoT \ndevices for action or real-time feedback. \n4. Fog/Cloud IoT Architecture\
    \ Challenges\nFog/Cloud-based IoT architectures have many benefits but \nalso\
    \ many drawbacks [18]: \n4.1 Security \nFog nodes are vulnerable to security breaches\
    \ due to their \ndecentralized nature. Data and system integrity depend on \n\
    strong security and encryption at the Fog and Cloud layers. \n4.2 Data Management\
    \ \nLarge-scale deployments can make data management and \nsynchronization difficult.\
    \ Data integrity requires efficient \ndata storage, retrieval, and synchronization.\
    \ \nFog nodes have limited computational, storage, and energy \nresources. \n\
    Maintaining \nsystem \nperformance \nrequires \noptimizing Fog node resource use\
    \ and load balancing. \nFigure 1: Fog/ Cloud based IoT advantages. \n4.3 Interoperability\
    \  \nDifferent vendors make IoT devices and sensors with several \ntypes and communication\
    \ protocols. Maintaining device-\nFog/Cloud interoperability is difficult. \n\
    4.4 Edge-to-Cloud Decisions \nChoosing whether to process data and tasks at the\
    \ edge (Fog) \nor in the Cloud is difficult. Optimizing system performance \n\
    requires balancing local processing and centralized Cloud \nanalysis [19]. \n\
    Fog/Cloud-based IoT architectures can solve the exponential \ngrowth of IoT data.\

    \ low-latency decision-making, and improved user \nexperiences by combining Fog\
    \ computing's edge processing \nwith Cloud computing's scalability and power.\
    \ To realize the \nfull potential of Fog/Cloud-based IoT architectures in \ncreating\
    \ a more connected and intelligent world, security, \ndata management, resource\
    \ constraints, interoperability, and \ndecision-making must be addressed. \n5.\
    \ Security Measures in Fog/Cloud-based\nIoT Systems\nAs Fog/Cloud-based IoT systems\
    \ evolve and become more \nwidespread, protecting these interconnected devices\
    \ and their \ndata becomes crucial. Fog computing's distributed nature, the \n\
    considerable number of IoT devices, and their importance in \nvarious applications\
    \ increase the attack surface for cyber \nthreats. The Fog and Cloud layers must\
    \ implement strong \nsecurity measures to reduce these security risks and protect\
    \ \ndata integrity and confidentiality [20],[21]. This section \ndiscusses Fog/Cloud-based\
    \ IoT security measures. \n5.1 Authentication and Access Control \nIoT devices\
    \ and users must be authenticated before accessing \nthe system. Password-based,\
    \ two-factor, and biometric \nauthentication ensure only authorized users can\
    \ access IoT \ndevices and sensitive data. Access control policies must be \n\
    implemented to regulate user and device access based on \nroles and privileges.\
    \ Fog/Cloud-based IoT systems use \nRBAC and ABAC access control models. \n5.2\
    \ Encryption and Secure Communication \nIoT devices, Fog nodes, and Cloud data\
    \ centres need \nencryption to protect data. End-to-end encryption keeps data\
    \ \nsecure; only intended recipients can decrypt it. Fog/Cloud-\nbased IoT systems\
    \ use TLS and SSL for secure \ncommunication. MQTT and CoAP can also securely\
    \ transfer \ndata between IoT devices and the Fog layer. \n5.3 \nIntrusion \n\
    Detection \nand \nPrevention \nSystems (IDPS) \nIDPS helps find and respond to\
    \ cyber threats in real time. \nThese systems analyse network traffic for signs\
    \ of \nunauthorized access or malicious activity. The IDPS can \nalert, block\
    \ suspicious traffic, or automatically counterattack \nwhen detecting an anomaly\
    \ [22]. \n5.4 Security Patches and Updates \nIoT devices, Fog node, and Cloud\
    \ data centre software and \nfirmware must be regularly updated to address known\
    \ \nvulnerabilities. Manufacturers and developers should quickly \nrelease security\
    \ patches and updates to fix vulnerabilities and \nprevent new threats. Automated\
    \ updates can also keep \ndevices and systems secure [23]. \n5.5 \nSecure \nBootstrapping\
    \ \nand \nDevice \nOnboarding \nNew devices must be securely connected to the\
    \ network to \nprevent unauthorized devices from accessing the Fog/Cloud-\nbased\
    \ IoT system. Secure bootstrapping involves device \nauthentication \nand \nsecure\
    \ \ncommunication. \nDevice \ncertificates, PKI, and attestation can secure bootstrapping.\
    \ \n5.6 \nTrust \nManagement \nand \nBlockchain \nApplications \nFog/Cloud-based\
    \ IoT systems use trust management \nmechanisms to set up trust between entities.\
    \ IoT devices, Fog \nnodes, and Cloud data centres must be trusted before \naccessing\
    \ \ncritical \nresources \nand \ndata. \nBlockchain's \ndecentralized and immutable\
    \ ledger for transactions and \ndevice interactions can boost trust and security.\
    \ \n5.7 Physical Security \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems need digital and physical\
    \ \nsecurity. IoT devices, Fog nodes, and Cloud data centres must \nhave restricted\
    \ physical access to prevent hardware theft. \nAccess control, surveillance, and\
    \ tamper-resistant enclosures \ncan deter physical attacks. \n5.8 Security Audits\
    \ and Monitoring \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems need regular security audits \n\
    and checking to find vulnerabilities and security breaches. \nSecurity audits\
    \ evaluate the system's security, while \ncontinuous monitoring tracks system\
    \ activities, network \ntraffic, and user behaviour for suspicious or malicious\
    \ activity \n[24]. \n6. Privacy Preservation in Fog/Cloud-\nbased IoT Systems\n\
    Fog/Cloud-based IoT systems collect and process substantial \namounts of sensitive\
    \ data from individuals, organizations, \nand smart devices, making privacy preservation\
    \ a major \nconcern. Fog computing's scale and distributed nature, \ncombined\
    \ with Cloud data centres’ centralized data storage \nand processing, can make\
    \ privacy protection difficult. \nThroughout the data lifecycle, privacy-preserving\
    \ methods \naddress these issues and protect personal data. This section \ndiscusses\
    \ Fog/Cloud-based IoT privacy measures [25]. \nAnonymization and pseudonymization\
    \ protect data subjects' \nidentities. Data is anonymized by removing or obfuscating\
    \ \ndirect identifiers. However, pseudonymization allows data to \nbe linked across\
    \ records without revealing individual \nidentities. These methods prevent re-identification\
    \ and de-\nidentify data before processing and analysis [26]. \n6.1 Differential\
    \ Privacy \nDifferential privacy supplies mathematical guarantees to \nprotect\
    \ individual privacy while allowing useful data \nanalysis. Before aggregation,\
    \ it adds random noise to the data \nto minimize the effect of individual data.\
    \ This mechanism \nprevents the extraction of individual data while allowing \n\
    valuable insights from aggregated data. \nEAI Endorsed Transactions on \nAI and\
    \ Robotics\nP. D. Singh and K. D. Singh\n4 \n6.2 Privacy-aware Data Processing\
    \ \nPrivacy rules and policies are implemented during data \nprocessing. These\
    \ methods minimize privacy breaches by \nensuring data is managed according to\
    \ privacy regulations \nand best practices. Privacy-aware algorithms and protocols\
    \ \nbalance privacy with data processing goals [27]. \n6.3 Data Minimization \n\
    Data minimization collects and stores only the data needed \nfor a specific purpose.\
    \ By collecting less data, privacy risks \nare reduced. Data minimization involves\
    \ removing obsolete \ndata. \n6.4 Privacy Policies and User Consent \nManagement\
    \  \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems need clear privacy policies to \ninform users\
    \ how their data will be collected, processed, and \nshared. User consent management\
    \ ensures explicit consent \nfor data collection and use. Users can choose what\
    \ data they \nshare and for what purposes with granular consent \npreferences.\
    \ \n6.5 Secure Data Transfer and Storage \nEncrypted communication channels and\
    \ secure sockets \nprotect data transmitted between IoT devices, Fog nodes, and\
    \ \nCloud data centres. Data encryption protects data at rest from \nunauthorized\
    \ access. \n6.6 Data Ownership and Control \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems should\
    \ enable data ownership \nand control. Data subjects should be able to access,\
    \ change, \nremove, and revoke consent for data processing. This gives \npeople\
    \ control over their data and improves data management \ntransparency. \nFog/Cloud-based\
    \ \nIoT \nsystems \nmust \nfollow \nprivacy \nregulations like the EU's General\
    \ Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR) or the US's California Consumer Privacy\
    \ Act \n(CCPA). These regulations protect privacy rights and hold \norganizations\
    \ accountable for data processing [28]. \n7. Challenges and Limitations\nFog/Cloud-based\
    \ IoT systems have many advantages, such as \nlow latency, improved scalability,\
    \ and enhanced data \nprocessing. Still, they also have several drawbacks that\
    \ must \nbe addressed for successful deployment and operation. This \nsection\
    \ will discuss Fog/Cloud-based IoT system challenges \nand limitations [29][30].\
    \ \n7.1 Resource Constraints and Performance \nTrade-offs  \nFog nodes have limited\
    \ computational, storage, and energy \nresources, which can affect system performance.\
    \ Data \nprocessing and analysis tasks are distributed between the Fog \nand Cloud\
    \ layers, compromising local processing efficiency \nfor centralized Cloud computing.\
    \ Maintaining performance \nrequires balancing trade-offs and optimizing resource\
    \ \nutilization [31]. \n7.2 Scalability and Latency  \nAs IoT devices and data\
    \ volume grow, Fog/Cloud-based IoT \nsystems must scale. In dynamic, large-scale\
    \ deployments, \nscalability and load balancing between Fog nodes and Cloud \n\
    data centres can be difficult. Data transmission between Fog \nnodes and Cloud\
    \ data centres may cause latency issues, \naffecting real-time applications. \n\
    7.3 Interoperability and Standardization Issues \nDifferent vendors make IoT devices,\
    \ resulting in various \ndevice types, communication protocols, and data formats.\
    \ \nInteroperability between devices, Fog nodes, and Cloud data \ncentres requires\
    \ standardized communication protocols and \ndata exchange formats. Interoperability\
    \ issues can make \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems difficult to integrate [32]. \n\
    7.4 Security Issues  \nFog computing's distributed nature and many connected \n\
    devices increase cyber threats. Security and monitoring are \nneeded to secure\
    \ fog nodes, cloud data centres, and \ncommunication channels. End-to-end security\
    \ is essential to \nprevent data breaches and unauthorized access, especially\
    \ \nduring Fog Node-Cloud data transmission. \n7.5 Privacy Issues \nFog/Cloud-based\
    \ IoT systems manage massive amounts of \ndata, including sensitive personal information.\
    \ Privacy and \ndata analysis are difficult. Data anonymization and \ndifferential\
    \ privacy must be carefully applied to protect \nprivacy without compromising\
    \ data utility. \n7.6 Edge-to-Cloud Decisions \nChoosing whether to process data\
    \ and tasks at the edge (Fog) \nor in the Cloud is difficult. To perfect system\
    \ performance, \nconsider data volume, latency, and computational complexity \n\
    when balancing local processing and centralized Cloud \nanalysis. \n7.7 Energy\
    \ Efficiency and Sustainability  \nBattery-powered IoT devices consume a lot of\
    \ energy. IoT \ndevices must balance real-time processing and data \ntransmission\
    \ with energy-efficient operation to extend battery \nlife and reduce environmental\
    \ impact. Energy efficiency can \nbe improved by task offloading and sleep schedules.\
    \ \n7.8 Cost and Infrastructure  \nCloud data centres and Fog nodes are expensive\
    \ to deploy and \nkeep Fog/Cloud-based IoT systems. Adopting these \ntechnologies\
    \ \nrequires \nconsideration \nof \ninfrastructure, \noperational costs, and ROI\
    \ [33]. \n8. Conclusion\nFog computing, Cloud computing, and the Internet of Things\
    \ \n(IoT) have created a transformative era of technological \nEAI Endorsed Transactions\
    \ on \nAI and Robotics\nSecurity and Privacy in Fog/Cloud-based IoT Systems for\
    \ AI and Robotics \n5 \nadvancement, where interconnected devices, AI, and \n\
    Robotics are reshaping industries and changing how we \ninteract with our surroundings.\
    \ IoT systems with Fog and \nCloud-based architectures enable real-time data processing,\
    \ \nlow latency, and scalability for healthcare, transportation, \nindustrial\
    \ automation, smart cities, and more. This paper \nexamined security and privacy\
    \ in Fog/Cloud-based IoT \nsystems for AI and Robotics, highlighting their importance,\
    \ \nchallenges, and practical solutions. \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems must be\
    \ secure due to their \ndistributed nature and many connected devices. Security\
    \ must \nbe strong to prevent cyberattacks. Authentication and access \ncontrol\
    \ safeguard the system and sensitive data. IoT devices, \nFog nodes, and Cloud\
    \ data centres send data encrypted and \nsecurely. Intrusion Detection and Prevention\
    \ Systems (IDPS) \ncontinuously check network traffic and find suspicious \nactivities\
    \ to prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Security \npatches and updates are necessary\
    \ to fix vulnerabilities and \nprevent new threats. \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems\
    \ must preserve privacy to keep \nuser \nand \nstakeholder \ntrust. \nAnonymization\
    \ \nand \npseudonymization ensure that sensitive data is de-found \nduring processing.\
    \ Differential privacy mathematically \nguarantees individual privacy while allowing\
    \ meaningful \ndata analysis. Privacy-aware data processing and data \nminimization\
    \ reduce data exposure. Privacy policies and user \nconsent management allow users\
    \ to control and understand \ndata processing. \nTo be successful, Fog/Cloud-based\
    \ IoT systems must \novercome many challenges and limitations. Limited \ncomputational\
    \ power and energy in Fog nodes may affect \nsystem performance and scalability.\
    \ Balancing local \nprocessing efficiency with centralized Cloud capabilities\
    \ \nrequires careful trade-offs. Due to the diversity of IoT devices \nand communication\
    \ protocols, standardization is needed to \nensure seamless integration. \nDue\
    \ to the increased attack surface, security measures must \nbe strengthened to\
    \ keep up with evolving cyber threats. \nFog/Cloud-based IoT systems must apply\
    \ privacy-enhancing \ntechniques and follow privacy regulations to protect personal\
    \ \ndata without compromising data utility. Edge-to-Cloud \ndecision-making requires\
    \ intelligent task allocation between \nFog and Cloud layers, considering data\
    \ volume, latency, and \ncomputational complexity. \nBattery-powered IoT devices\
    \ must be energy efficient and \nsustainable to reduce environmental impact and\
    \ energy \nconsumption. Fog/Cloud-based IoT systems can perfect \nresource use\
    \ and budget allocation, but the cost must be \nconsidered. \nReferences \n[1]\n\

  description: Smart irrigation systems powered by IoT technology are vital in agriculture.
    Traditional methods often harm plant health and wastewater. Conversely, IoT-driven
    smart irrigation enhances water management, boosts crop yield, and supports sustainable
    farming. It uses sensors, data analysis, and automation to gather and analyse
    real-time data for informed decisions and real-time control. The hardware comprises
    a central unit using Raspberry Pi and sensors measuring Temperature, Humidity,
    and soil moisture. Node-red manages data flow and decision-making by incorporating
    sensor data and external weather information. It links with the Favoriot platform
    for seamless data streaming, offering cloud storage and analysis. A predefined
    set of thresholds for soil moisture, humidity, and Temperature guides irrigation
    decisions. This system provides precise irrigation assessments, customization,
    and secure cloud storage. By optimizing water usage, enhancing crop health, and
    enabling remote monitoring and control, it promotes sustainable water management
    in agriculture.

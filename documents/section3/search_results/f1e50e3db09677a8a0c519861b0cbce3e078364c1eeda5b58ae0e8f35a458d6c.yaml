    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\

    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\
    \ 1. Selected applications based on smart agriculture.\nRef.\nApp\nDescription\n\
    [7]\nSoil Analysis\nLand management offers long-term promise based\non climate,\
    \ geography, and reasonably stable soil\ncharacteristics (like soil texture, depth,\
    \ and\nmineralogy). This application aids farmers in better\nunderstanding the\
    \ potential of their land and climate\nvariations alteration and extenuation measures.\n\
    [9]\nFarm Manager\nFarm Manager App helps the farmers to decide\nwhich techniques\
    \ should apply before planting\nstarts. This app views, organizes, and edits all\n\
    information about your ﬁeld like yield, planting, and\nspraying conditions without\
    \ your mobile phone.\n[7]\nPest Management\nBy collecting pest occurrence information\
    \ from\nfarms, Village Tree provides smart pest control\nsolutions. In addition,\
    \ it employs a crowdsourcing\nstrategy, sending images and location data to other\n\
    farmers who may be affected.\n[9]\nAgrippa\nFarmer can generate electronics maps\
    \ of ﬁeld, keep a\nhistory of growing crops in the ﬁeld (e.g., planting,\nfertilizing,\
    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\
    \ the ﬁeld (e.g., soil\nsampling for agrochemical laboratory) by eFarmer\nApplication.\n\
    Semios\nCovers network coverage, orchard pests, frost,\ndiseases, and irrigation.\
    \ Event notiﬁcations are sent\nout in real-time as part of the monitoring services.\n\
    [7]\nFertilizer\nManagement\nEco Fert assists with fertilizer management so that\
    \ it\nmay be used to its full potential. It determines the\noptimal fertilizer\
    \ mixture created to cover the\nneeded nutrient suspension and considers the\n\
    demands of diverse yields. In addition, it considers\nthe cost of fertilizer based\
    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\

    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\
    \ RFID, Raspberry Pi, ZigBee,\nLoRa, and GPRS are less popular in the agriculture\
    \ and farming industries. In the agri-\ncultural and farming business comparison,\
    \ the farming sector uses IoT for automation\nslower [42]. The Plant Server and\
    \ User View were created with phpMyAdmin to manage\nMySQL server management. The\
    \ F-RCNN-qualiﬁed model for anomaly detection had\n80% conﬁdence, while the technique\
    \ for the transfer of learning illness had 95.75% accu-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\

    \ IoT.\n6. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe implementation of sustainable\
    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\
    \ agricultural productivity. Many processes throughout the production cycle,\n\
    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    Comments Skip Abstract Section Abstract Animals play a profoundly important and
    intricate role in our lives today. Dogs have been human companions for thousands
    of years, but now they work to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and
    rescue situations. Farm animals are a critical part of sustainable agriculture
    today, and there is increasing consumer interest in humanely raised livestock,
    and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint. Wild animals are threatened
    with extinction by human induced factors, and shrinking and compromised habitats.
    There are many reasons, including societal and economic ones, to explore how new
    computing technologies can be used to ensure the welfare of animals in these settings.
    The goal of this review is to systematically survey the existing literature in
    smart computing and sensing technologies for domestic, farm, and wild animal welfare.
    We use a broad notion of animal welfare to refer to an assessment of whether animals
    are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and positively stimulated in their environment.
    Smart computing and sensing is also used in broad terms, to refer to systems that
    are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of
    remote data collection, processing, exchange, and analysis. The findings of this
    review are expected to motivate future research in computer science and engineering,
    as well as contribute to data, information, and communication management for animal
    welfare. References Joelle Alcaidinho. 2016. Canine behavior and working dog suitability

    \ massive smart devices to collect big data and carry\nout the monitoring and\
    \ control of numerous things in cyber-physical systems (CPS). By leveraging\n\
    machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze the collected\
    \ data, physical\nsystems can be monitored and controlled effectively. Along with\
    \ the development of IoT and data\nanalysis technologies, a number of CPS (smart\
    \ grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart\ncities, etc.) adopt\
    \ IoT and data analysis technologies to improve their performance and operations.\n\
    Nonetheless, directly manipulating or updating the real system has inherent risks.\
    \ Thus, creating a\ndigital clone of a real physical system, denoted as a Digital\
    \ Twin (DT), is a viable strategy. Generally\nspeaking, a DT is a data-driven\
    \ software and hardware emulation platform, which is a cyber replica\nof physical\
    \ systems. Meanwhile, a DT describes a speciﬁc physical system and tends to achieve\n\
    the functions and use cases of physical systems. Since DT is a complex digital\
    \ system, ﬁnding\na way to effectively represent a variety of things in timely\
    \ and efﬁcient manner poses numerous\nchallenges to the networking, computing,\
    \ and data analytics for IoT. Furthermore, the design of\na DT for IoT systems\
    \ must consider numerous exceptional requirements (e.g., latency, reliability,\n\
    safety, scalability, security, and privacy). To address such challenges, the thoughtful\
    \ design of DTs\noffers opportunities for novel and interdisciplinary research\
    \ efforts. To address the aforementioned\nproblems and issues, in this paper,\
    \ we ﬁrst review the architectures of DTs, data representation,\nand communication\
    \ protocols. We then review existing efforts on applying DT into IoT data-driven\n\
    smart systems, including the smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities.\nFurther, we summarize the existing challenges from CPS, data\
    \ science, optimization, and security and\nprivacy perspectives. Finally, we outline\
    \ possible future research directions from the perspectives of\nperformance, new\
    \ DT-driven services, model and learning, and security and privacy.\nKeywords:\
    \ Digital Twin; Internet of Things (IoT); cyber-physical systems; smart-world\
    \ applications\n1. Introduction\nThe technological trend of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has led to a massive increase\nin the number of smart devices that are\
    \ connected to cyberspace [1–3]. In order for these\nsmart devices to make a meaningful\
    \ impact, it is important that they have the capability\nof capturing information\
    \ related to their intended use; some common information that\nwould be captured\
    \ from typical smart devices may include trafﬁc ﬂows, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and energy consumption. Depending on what a smart device is designed for,\n\
    it may capture the key characteristics of things so that the efﬁciency and intelligence\
    \ of\ncyber-physical systems (CPS), including energy, transportation, manufacturing,\
    \ agriculture,\nhealthcare, and other critical infrastructure systems, can be\
    \ realized [4–14]. Due to the\nlarge number of data points that are introduced\
    \ in these CPS, it is important to adopt\nadvanced networking, data analysis (e.g.,\
    \ deep learning), and cloud/edge computing\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64. https://doi.org/10.3390/ﬁ14020064\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n2 of\
    \ 25\ntechnologies in smart systems [15–21]. By doing this, the relevant information\
    \ can be\ncollected, transmitted, analyzed, and shared in a timely manner so that\
    \ usable information\ncan provide the intelligence to enhance the monitoring and\
    \ control abilities of physical\nsystems [22].\nAs an energy-based CPS, the smart\
    \ grid can be identiﬁed as a complex system, where\nnumerous uncertainties arise\
    \ in both cyber and physical components [23–26]. The uncer-\ntainties can be caused\
    \ by an outage in one part of the grid; in other words, the smart grid\nis susceptible\
    \ and is easily affected by random accidents such as power load imbalance,\noutages,\
    \ and even disruption from surrounding environments. We can understate both\n\
    the importance and frangibility of the smart grid, which is facing unprecedented\
    \ chal-\nlenges. Depending on the development of big data and IoT, adapting big\
    \ data analysis\ntools (ML/DL, data mining, statistics, etc.) can predict some\
    \ potential risks, in order to\nmitigate accidents in the smart grid [27]. Furthermore,\
    \ leveraging big data can establish\na virtual smart grid environment to simulate\
    \ real accidents, to investigate and develop\nmitigation plans.\nAnother example\
    \ is related to wireless sensors networks, which can be used in different\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring systems. For example, smart farming is an emerging application\n\
    that connects IoT devices so that agricultural production, soil quality, and temperature\n\
    humidity can be managed [12,28,29]. Due to the harsh weather and environments,\
    \ there are\nnumerous uncertainties that could affect the reliability of connectivity\
    \ and physical devices\nin smart farming. The uncertainties of the smart farming\
    \ system can cause failures and\nlead to the quantity and quality reduction of\
    \ agricultural products. Thus, it is necessary\nto design and implement the smart\
    \ farming system as a typical CPS in the agriculture\ndomain so that important\
    \ data can be collected and efﬁcient operations of smart farms can\nbe supported.\
    \ To this end, leveraging the collected data to create a cyber replica of the\n\
    farming system for testing and evaluation is a feasible approach to deal with\
    \ a variety of\nuncertainties in the system.\nLikewise, in smart manufacturing\
    \ systems, leveraging big data analysis can help\nsystem administrators and engineers\
    \ discover vulnerabilities in the system. In addition,\nbased on big data analysis,\
    \ system administrators and engineers can update systems\nto optimize supply chain\
    \ and production performance [7,30,31]. Nonetheless, directly\nmanipulating or\
    \ updating the real system has some critical risks. Thus, creating a cyber\nreplica\
    \ of real physical systems to emulate real cases in those physical systems is\
    \ an efﬁcient\nstrategy, which is named Digital Twin (DT).\nGenerally speaking,\
    \ DT is a digital clone of a real physical system. The vision of DT\nrefers to\
    \ data-driven software and hardware set that describes a real physical system\
    \ with all\nfunctions and use cases. It also includes all status and information\
    \ in life-cycle phases [32].\nWith obvious beneﬁts, integrating DT into CPS could\
    \ pose numerous challenges to mod-\neling, computing, networking, and data analysis,\
    \ alongside the exceptional requirements\nof CPS with respect to latency, reliability,\
    \ safety, scalability, security, and privacy, among\nothers. While advanced networking,\
    \ computing, and data analysis technologies can help\nthe realization of DT, there\
    \ are a number of issues that need to be addressed, including\nhow to deﬁne the\
    \ theoretical foundation and modeling techniques such that DT accurately\nand\
    \ reliably reﬂect the states of things, how to design ML/DL models to achieve\
    \ real-time\nbig data processing, and and how to secure DT and protect privacy-sensitive\
    \ information\ncollection and publishing.\nThere are some existing studies that\
    \ have proposed feasible approaches, such as\nleveraging multi-domain and multi-level\
    \ designs in manufacturing systems; that is, designs\nbased on different sub-system\
    \ digital abstractions in different domains, and designs based\non the principal\
    \ structures of real physical systems at different levels [33]. In order to\n\
    ensure that DT can represent the physical systems precisely, the multi-domain\
    \ and multi-\nlevel design process must accompany the life-cycle of real physical\
    \ systems. In addition,\nsome existing surveys summarize existing DT efforts that\
    \ are designed to emulate real\nphysical systems. For example, there are several\
    \ existing surveys focusing on inspecting\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n3 of\
    \ 25\nthe framework of DT in industrial systems [30,34–36]. Additionally, some\
    \ studies have\nfocused on categorizing different DTs in the power grid [37–40].\
    \ Nonetheless, since IoT is\nwidely applied to different physical systems, it\
    \ is necessary to conduct a comprehensive\ninvestigation of extending DTs to IoT-based\
    \ smart systems driven by data science and\nengineering. Furthermore, based on\
    \ new techniques, the challenges and future research\ndirections for DT need to\
    \ be discussed.\nTo address the aforementioned problems and issues, we make the\
    \ following contribu-\ntions in this study.\n•\nWe begin with the architecture\
    \ design of existing DTs, which includes DT variants,\nDT sub-types, and IoT-based\
    \ DT. We then review the data representation and com-\nmunication protocols for\
    \ DT. In addition, we present the use cases for applying DT\ninto a variety of\
    \ smart-world systems, which include smart grid, smart transportation,\nsmart\
    \ city, and smart manufacturing, as typical CPS.\n•\nBased on the architecture\
    \ and its applications to smart-world systems, we discuss chal-\nlenges that arise\
    \ from four perspectives: CPS, data science, optimization, and security\nand privacy.\
    \ We also present several research directions for DT that we strongly feel\nneed\
    \ further research, including performance, new DT-driven services, modeling and\n\
    machine learning, and security and privacy.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized\
    \ as follows: In Section 2, we provide the\nhistorical background of DT, including\
    \ the key concepts, techniques, architecture, and\nprotocols of DT. In Section\
    \ 3, we review the examples of applying DT into smart-world\nsystems, including\
    \ smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart cities\nas\
    \ case study. In Section 4, we present the challenges of DT from the perspectives\
    \ of CPS,\ndata science, optimization, and security and privacy. In Section 5,\
    \ we outline possible\nfuture research directions from the perspectives of performance,\
    \ new DT-driven services,\nmodeling and machine learning, and security and privacy.\
    \ Finally, we summarize the paper\nin Section 6.\n2. Digital Twin\nIn this section,\
    \ we review the basic concepts and architecture of DT, as well as data\nrepresentation\
    \ and communication protocols for enabling DT.\n2.1. Basic Concepts\nA DT system\
    \ can be regarded as a replica of a target physical system. It leverages\na model\
    \ to continuously simulate different functions of physical systems. In order to\n\
    accomplish this, the DT must have a connection with the target physical entity\
    \ so that the\nstate of physical things can be collected and updated. Thus, a\
    \ DT model can be used to\npredict, control, or optimize the functionality of\
    \ things while at the same time learning\nfrom things that it represents. Note\
    \ that the function of a DT is more than just simulation; it\ncan interact with\
    \ the physical system so that it can adapt to environmental changes.\nDT technology\
    \ relies heavily on the ability of ingesting large amounts of data and\ndrawing\
    \ conclusions on their correlation. Because of this, DT is closely tied with big\n\
    modeling driven by advanced ML/DL and big data analytic techniques so that real-time\n\
    forecasting and prediction can be achieved. For example, by leveraging DT in manufac-\n\
    turing processes, we can plan repair and maintenance activities, which could eliminate\n\
    failures from the manufacturing process. In order to obtain this seamless integration\
    \ of DT\nand physical systems, it is critical that the DT obtains the real-time\
    \ state information of\nphysical systems (i.e., sharing a connection to data);\
    \ this is realized by using IoT sensors\nand networking technologies.\nSimulation\
    \ technology has been evolving for several decades and is most commonly\nused\
    \ in Computer Aided Design (CAD), where a simulation of a system can gather insight\n\
    for a possible conclusion to a speciﬁc scenario. DT improves on this technology\
    \ by intro-\nducing ML/DL engines to interpret data that can interact with the\
    \ physical system. This\nimportant distinction between traditional simulations\
    \ and DT is made possible through\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n4 of 25\nthe\
    \ use of sensors, communication networks, data aggregation, and analysis, as well\
    \ as\ncost-effective and intelligent decision core, which can interpret the process\
    \ and provide\nreal-time feedback to the system.\n2.2. Architecture\nGenerally\
    \ speaking, DT can be divided into three parts: the physical system, the digital\n\
    system, and the connection between them. Figure 1 illustrates the general architecture\
    \ of a\nDT. The physical system represents any actual system in the real world,\
    \ including smart\ngrid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart\
    \ cities. The physical system can\nprovide service to multiple users. Nonetheless,\
    \ the environment may change when the\nphysical system operates. In this case,\
    \ the physical system needs to take action to handle\nthis change. Nonetheless,\
    \ it can be difﬁcult to update a real physical model based on a\ncomplex operating\
    \ procedure. Under such a circumstance, the DT can leverage a simpliﬁed\nphysical\
    \ system and, using the data from the new environment, perform simulation and\n\
    guide the physical system to perform the next step.\nFigure 1. DT Architecture.\n\
    2.2.1. DT Variants\nBased on different types of data sharing between physical\
    \ and digital systems, we can\ncategorize DT into three variants: Digital Model,\
    \ Digital Shadow, and Digital Twin (DT).\nFigure 2 represents the architecture\
    \ of these DT variants.\nFigure 2. DT Variants.\nGenerally speaking, digital modeling\
    \ refers to a digital representation of one existing\nphysical system or its theoretical\
    \ model. The digital representation of the system may\nFuture Internet 2022, 14,\
    \ 64\n5 of 25\ninclude a detailed description of the physical components. A distinct\
    \ difference is that\na true DT system would utilize the data collected from the\
    \ physical system to build a\ndigital system for simulation and control of the\
    \ physical system based on the simulation\nresults. Nonetheless, for digital models,\
    \ digital systems cannot automatically manipulate\nphysical systems based on digital\
    \ system simulation results [30,41]. Changes to the physical\nrepresentation will\
    \ not affect the digital representation and vice versa.\nTo expand on the modeling\
    \ capabilities of the digital model, the Digital Shadow\nfurther takes the simulation\
    \ and integrates a one-way data ﬂow from the physical object to\nthe digital representation\
    \ [42]. Changes to the state of the physical systems can dynamically\nalter the\
    \ representation of the digital model based on changing states in the physical\
    \ system.\nThis type of digital modeling can be used as a virtual representation\
    \ of the physical system.\nIn this way, the system administrator can intuitively\
    \ observe the operation of the physical\nsystem and can respond in time according\
    \ to the existing problems of the system. Changes\nto the physical system can\
    \ have impacts on the virtual model but not vice versa.\nThe DT is an extension\
    \ of the digital model and digital shadow. The distinct difference\nbetween the\
    \ two previous examples and a DT system is the two-way link between the\nphysical\
    \ system and the digital model. One beneﬁt of having the two-way link is the ability\n\
    to affect the physical system based on the digital representation. Changes in\
    \ the physical\nsystem can be reﬂected over the digital model so that possible\
    \ outcomes based on system\nvariables can be output. The link back to the physical\
    \ system allows the control system to\ninteract with the physical system so that\
    \ a desired outcome can be achieved.\n2.2.2. Types of DT\nIn addition to the three\
    \ variants mentioned above, the DT can be categorized into four\ntypes: DT prototype\
    \ (DTP) [43], DT instance (DTI) [44], DT aggregation (DTA) [45], and DT\nenvironment\
    \ (DTE) [44–46]. Figures 3 and 4 represent the architecture of DT types and DT\n\
    environment, respectively.\nFigure 3. DT types.\nFigure 4. DT environment.\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2022, 14, 64\n6 of 25\nThe DTP represents a type of DT framework that\
    \ leverages all the information from\nthe physical system, which is necessary\
    \ to reproduce the system in the physical world.\nThe data ﬂow transfers from\
    \ the physical system to the digital system. The purpose of\nDTP is to improve\
    \ the time and cost efﬁciency of the operation of the physical system.\nDTP can\
    \ be used in monitoring systems, such as smart grid monitoring systems. However,\n\
    the DTP data ﬂow is a one-way ﬂow from the physical system to the digital system.\
    \ It can\nonly monitor the system and cannot manage it according to the incoming\
    \ data from the\nphysical system.\nThe DTI is a type of DT that connects to its\
    \ corresponding physical target. Unlike\nthe DTP, the DTI handles the data ﬂow\
    \ from the digital system to the physical system.\nThe data ﬂow contains predictions\
    \ or guidelines, which assist the physical system to\noperate simultaneously when\
    \ the environment changes. With both DTP and DTI, the two-\nway connection between\
    \ the physical system and digital system has been established.\nNonetheless, the\
    \ DTI only represents a single data ﬂow from the digital system to the\nphysical\
    \ system. In this case, another term, called DTA, has been proposed to represent\n\
    the aggregation of all the DTIs. DTI/DTA can be used to manage systems as data\
    \ ﬂows\nfrom digital systems to physical systems. The operator can operate the\
    \ physical system\naccording to the prediction result of the physical system.\
    \ Nonetheless, the DTI/DTA\ndata ﬂow cannot be transferred directly from the physical\
    \ system to the digital system.\nAdditional mechanisms need to be implemented\
    \ to retrieve information from the physical\nsystem to enable the DT to operate.\n\
    The DTE (DT environment) can be considered as the boundary of the DT application.\n\
    One DTE can contain multiple DT systems. The DTE is responsible for managing all\
    \ the\nDT systems under its coverage to assist in the operation of the relevant\
    \ physical systems.\nFrom the application point of view, DTE can be used to manage\
    \ large systems. At the\nsame time, a synchronization mechanism needs to be implemented\
    \ to speed up the query\nprocessing among multiple digital systems.\n2.2.3. Architecture\
    \ for IoT Systems\nAs massive numbers of IoT devices have been implemented across\
    \ a variety of real-\nworld applications and physical locations, and the collection,\
    \ aggregation, storage, and anal-\nysis of their generated data is a prodigious\
    \ challenge. Figure 5 illustrates a generic architec-\nture for IoT systems [47],\
    \ which consists of four layers (i.e., object layer, communication\nlayer, application\
    \ layer, and end-user layer).\nFigure 5. DT architecture for IoT.\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2022, 14, 64\n7 of 25\nThe object layer represents all IoT sensors and is used\
    \ to provide data and information\nfor different IoT-driven applications. It contains\
    \ all the components that make up the\nphysical system. The communication layer\
    \ provides communication network infrastructure\nto collect IoT devices and collect\
    \ data for DT. For example, a number of edge gateways can\nbe deployed to collect\
    \ and aggregate information from sensors and send the information\nto the application\
    \ layer. IoT sensors and gateways use different communication protocols\nto collect\
    \ and transmit information. After the gateway in the object layer obtains the\n\
    information, it transmits the data to the application layer. The application layer\
    \ includes\nthe digital systems of DT. At this level, the DT system ﬁrst maps\
    \ all sensor and gateway\ninformation to the digital system. At the same time,\
    \ we can use the IoT naming service\nto name the mapped IoT sensors and local\
    \ gateways, so that the digital system can locate\ndifferent resources [48]. The\
    \ digital system can then use ML/DL models to perform\nprediction and analysis.\
    \ By doing so, the digital system can control the actuators in the\ntarget layer\
    \ based on the prediction results. Furthermore, the prediction and analysis\n\
    results can provide different services in the end-user layer. The end-user layer\
    \ provides\nservices for users, who can send requests to the application layer.\
    \ After that, the digital\nsystem will analyze the information obtained and respond\
    \ with the results accordingly.\nBased on the architecture of the DT system, data\
    \ representation and communication\nprotocols are essential for data sharing within\
    \ the DT, as well the provisioning of services\nto end users.\n2.3. Data Representation\n\
    Data representation enables components to understand data from different domains\
    \ [49–51].\nSeveral commonly used data representation protocols in DT are DT Deﬁnition\
    \ Language\n(DTDL) [52], FIWARE [53], OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (OPC UA) [54,55],\
    \ and Feature-Based\nDT Framework (FDTF) [56]. In particular, DTDL is an open-standard\
    \ platform proposed by\nMicrosoft [52], which can realize data transmission within\
    \ the system or between different\nsystems. The summary of data representation\
    \ protocols is listed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Protocols of DTs.\nProtocol Name\n\
    Protocol Type\nProtocol Characteristics\nDTDL\nData Representation\nAs an open-standard\
    \ platform, it deﬁnes six characteristics\nof IoT components and enables seamless\
    \ data transmission\nbetween different DTs.\nFIWARE\nData Representation\nIt supports\
    \ DT data transmission and the processing of con-\ntextual information received\
    \ from various IoT components.\nOPC UA\nData Representation\nAs a modeling framework,\
    \ it can retrieve information from\nraw data, support data manipulation, and provide\
    \ monitor-\ning capabilities.\nFDTF\nData Representation\nAs a DT structure, it\
    \ enables the DT system to share informa-\ntion based on the data link between\
    \ DT components.\nCoAP\nCommunication\nAs a specialized web communication protocol\
    \ based on the\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP), it is tailored for resource-\nrestricted\
    \ devices, supports the transmission of data via Hy-\npertext Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP), and provides a publish and\nsubscribe mechanism to simplify the process\
    \ of obtaining\ncontinuous data from the sensor.\nMQTT\nCommunication\nAs a communication\
    \ protocol based on Transmission Con-\ntrol Protocol (TCP), it enables lightweight\
    \ way for IoT\ndevices to communicate, provides reliable data transfer,\nand can\
    \ establish a long-existing outgoing TCP protocol\nto enable transmission.\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2022, 14, 64\n8 of 25\nTable 1. Cont.\nProtocol Name\nProtocol Type\n\
    Protocol Characteristics\nModbus TCP/IP\nCommunication\nAs a communication protocol\
    \ based on Transmission Control\nProtocol (TCP), it realizes the connection between\
    \ industrial\ndevices, provides reliable data transfer, and contains built-in\n\
    checksum protection.\nURLLC\nCommunication\nAs a communication protocol, it tends\
    \ to achieve low la-\ntency and reliability in the transmission process between\n\
    IoT devices.\nDTDL [52] deﬁnes the following six characteristics of IoT components:\
    \ (i) Interface: the\nbasic information of a component (device ID, device type,\
    \ display content, etc.). Different\ninterfaces can inherit attributes from parent\
    \ interfaces (e.g., charging station components\ncan inherit some attributes of\
    \ the parking lot such as addresses); (ii) Telemetry: the data sent\nfrom any\
    \ component in the IoT-based DT (the raw data from IoT sensors, the processed\n\
    data generated by DT models, etc.); (iii) Property: the status of the components\
    \ in the\nIoT-based DT (i.e., the device is read-only or read-write). This can\
    \ also include the different\nstates between different DT (whether the data between\
    \ the two DTs are consistent, etc.); (iv)\nCommand: operations that any DT can\
    \ understand; (v) Relationship: the connection between\nthe DTs (e.g., the relationship\
    \ between the house and the cleaner is cleaned up); and (vi)\nComponent: the entities\
    \ that exist in the DT, including sensors, gateways, and digital systems.\nBased\
    \ upon these six components, DTDL can be composed of multiple DTs with a uniﬁed\n\
    structure and data, which enables seamless data transmission between different\
    \ DTs.\nFIWARE [53] is also an open-source project designed to support DT data\
    \ transmis-\nsion and the processing of contextual information received from various\
    \ IoT components.\nFIWARE developed a data modeling standard called FIWARE NGSI\
    \ that describes the\ncollection, processing, and change notiﬁcation operations\
    \ of contextual information. FI-\nWARE NGSI is an object-oriented data protocol\
    \ that uses context objects to represent\nphysical/digital objects. NGSI provides\
    \ a data model that enables data exchange between\nmultiple DTs. It also uses\
    \ NGSI-LD to represent the relationship between different objects\nand uses JSON-LD\
    \ for encoding to unify the data format.\nOPC UA [54,55] is a modeling framework\
    \ that can retrieve information from raw\ndata. OPC UA deﬁnes the data transmission\
    \ and understanding model between different\nsystems. It also has a mechanism\
    \ to traverse all data and analyze its semantics. OPC UA\nsupports data manipulation\
    \ to make it easier to manage data under the DT architecture.\nFurthermore, it\
    \ provides monitoring capabilities, enabling the DT system to manage the\nstate\
    \ of all sensors under the control.\nFDTF [56] is a DT structure that enables\
    \ the DT system to share information based on\nthe data link between DT components.\
    \ This structure realizes data sharing between digital\nsystems and physical systems,\
    \ as well as data sharing within different DT models.\n2.4. Communication Protocols\n\
    The communication protocol realizes the information transmission between IoT\n\
    devices, and between IoT systems [49–51]. There are some representative communica-\n\
    tion protocols common across IoT systems, including Constrained Application Protocol\n\
    (CoAP) [57,58], OASIS Standard Message Passing Protocol (MQTT) [59], Modbus TCP/IP\n\
    Protocol [60–64], and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) [65]. The\
    \ sum-\nmary of communication protocols are listed in Table 1.\nCoAP [57,58] is\
    \ a specialized web communication protocol based on the User Data-\ngram Protocol\
    \ (UDP), tailored for resource-restricted devices (battery-powered IoT devices,\n\
    etc.). CoAP can be used to handle communication between IoT devices. It is designed\
    \ to be\ncompatible with the transmission of data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) and is\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n9 of 25\nmore compatible with Web-based\
    \ applications. CoAP can provide a publish and subscribe\nmechanism to simplify\
    \ the process of obtaining continuous data from the sensor.\nMQTT [59] is the\
    \ communication protocol based on Transmission Control Protocol\n(TCP). It is\
    \ a lightweight way for IoT devices to communicate with each other through\nMQTT\
    \ messages. These messages are lightweight due to their optimized headers, so\n\
    that the use of network resources can be reduced. The MQTT protocol includes MQTT\n\
    clients and MQTT brokers. The MQTT client can be IoT sensors, and the MQTT broker\
    \ can\nbe deployed in an IoT gateway, which is used to manage data communication\
    \ between\nsensors and control commands to IoT actuators. Since MQTT is based\
    \ on the TCP protocol,\nit can provide reliable data transfer. Furthermore, IoT\
    \ sensors may need to establish a\nconnection with the IoT gateway within a certain\
    \ period of time. In this case, with the\nhelp of MQTT brokers, IoT sensors can\
    \ establish a long-existing outgoing TCP protocol to\nenable transmission.\nModbus\
    \ TCP/IP [60–64] is a communication protocol used in the industrial ﬁeld to\n\
    realize the connection between industrial devices. The protocol was initially\
    \ proposed\nto provide communication between Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).\
    \ Modbus\nTCP/IP uses port 502 for data transfer. Meanwhile, the protocol contains\
    \ built-in checksum\nprotection, which can ensure the reliability of the data\
    \ transmission required in IoT systems.\nWith the aid of Modbus TCP/IP protocol,\
    \ reliable operations can be supported and applied\nto the smart grid, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and other IoT systems.\nURLLC [65] is a communication protocol that can achieve\
    \ low latency and reliability\nin the transmission process between IoT devices.\
    \ Generally speaking, URLLC is based on\nthe 5G wireless protocol, which can reduce\
    \ the delay to 0.5 ms. In order to reduce the delay,\nURLLC uses a mini-slot for\
    \ smaller time resource units, removes the scheduling mechanism\nof direct channel\
    \ access, supports asynchronous upload, and adopts dynamic scheduling\nalgorithms\
    \ such as hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In order to improve reliability,\n\
    URLLC utilizes a channel estimation mechanism, a transmission diversity mechanism,\n\
    and a bit error rate reduction mechanism. With the aid of URLLC, IoT sensors can\
    \ exchange\ninformation faster and more reliably.\n3. Integrating DT in CPS\n\
    In this section, we review some existing efforts on integrating DT in different\
    \ CPS\nsuch as the smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and\
    \ smart cities. DT\nin CPS is an evolving ﬁeld of research. There have been growing\
    \ research interests on\nintegrating DT in CPS. Figure 6 shows the number of recent\
    \ publications from 2018 to 2022\nfrom IEEE Xplore on the subject of DT and CPS\
    \ from four representative CPS (smart grid,\nsmart transportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities). The included papers are\nrelated to both DT system and CPS\
    \ system in the content or in the experiment.\nFigure 6. Number of publications\
    \ related to DT and CPS in IEEE Xplore.\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n10 of 25\n\
    3.1. Framework\nFigure 7 describes an architecture option of a DT-driven smart-world\
    \ system motivated\nby the existing efforts on DT [33]. The architecture consists\
    \ of three main components:\nthe physical subsystem, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (AI) model, and the DT model. The IoT\ngateway from each physical system collects\
    \ and aggregates the data from the physical\nsystem. With the support of communication\
    \ protocols, data can be transmitted from the\nphysical system to the AI model.\
    \ The AI model is used for data analysis and model design\nbased on the states\
    \ of physical system. Then, the AI model stores its trained model as a\nDT model\
    \ to represent the digital perspective of physical system. If the conﬁguration\
    \ of\nphysical system does not change, the DT model can guide the physical system\
    \ to react\nbased on the data collected by physical system. If the conﬁguration\
    \ of physical system\nchanges or needs to respond differently to the same situation,\
    \ the AI model can update its\nmodel according to the changes of physical system\
    \ and revise the DT model to further assist\nthe operations of physical system.\
    \ Recall that DT can assist in the control and operation of\nphysical systems\
    \ [34].\nFigure 7. DT-based CPS.\n3.2. Smart Grid\nAs a key energy infrastructure,\
    \ the smart grid leverages information communication\ntechnology (i.e., cyber\
    \ system) to provide two-way communication (of both energy and\ninformation) so\
    \ that the monitoring and control of the grid can be improved and consumers\n\
    can be engaged. The physical infrastructure of the power grid is composed of power\
    \ gener-\nation facilities, transmission facilities, and power distribution facilities.\
    \ Power generation\nfacilities are responsible for generating electricity, while\
    \ transmission facilities are used\nto deliver power to distribution facilities.\
    \ Finally, power distribution facilities provide\nelectricity to consumers.\n\
    With the integration of the cyber system, the next-generation power grid, denoted\n\
    as the smart grid, has been envisioned to provide more efﬁcient energy service\
    \ for users,\nincluding reliable and intelligent distribution management, renewable\
    \ energy integration,\nenergy storage, grid monitoring and control, and the integration\
    \ of electric vehicles into\nthe grid [5]. Generally speaking, the smart grid\
    \ is a highly distributed grid system, which\nintegrates information communication\
    \ techniques, including sensing, networking commu-\nnications, data analytics,\
    \ and machine learning [66,67]. These technologies can improve the\nreliability,\
    \ efﬁciency, and security resilience of the grid system.\nThe smart grid system\
    \ is a large-scale distributed system. To improve the monitor\nand control of\
    \ the grid, it is critical to know the states of physical objects (voltage, current,\n\
    etc.) in the system. To do so, a massive quantity of sensors can be deployed in\
    \ the grid\nto measure the state of critical objects and derive the accurate and\
    \ insightful knowledge\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n11 of 25\nof physical objects\
    \ based on measurements. In the past, both static and dynamic state\nestimation\
    \ have been applied to the monitoring and control of the grid, and bad data\n\
    detection algorithms have also been designed to deal with corrupted, invalid measurement,\n\
    and/or malicious injection data, which can be generated via measurement error,\
    \ sensor\nfailure, or even cyber threats [24,25]. Note that in addition to potential\
    \ failures in the grid,\ncyber threats can directly or indirectly affect the grid’s\
    \ operations by injecting malicious\nmeasurement data and/or manipulating the\
    \ critical control information to the actuator.\nTo handle cyber threats, it is\
    \ critical to not only monitor the state of physical objects but also\nmonitor\
    \ the state of cyber components. In this regard, the DT can be a viable approach\
    \ to\nlink the objects in the physical world to the cyber world.\nDT uses a data-driven\
    \ modeling strategy to map the physical grid to the digital grid\nso that monitoring\
    \ and management operations for the entire grid can be enabled. Based\non the\
    \ DT architecture that we have discussed, the smart grid system can be divided\
    \ into\nseveral layers: object layer, communication layer, application layer,\
    \ and end-user layer.\nIn the object layer, grid components include power generation\
    \ facilities, transmission\nfacilities, and power distribution facilities. The\
    \ communication layer is responsible for\nthe communication to connect objects,\
    \ supporting data exchange between the objects and\nthe application layer, and\
    \ the data communication within the object layer. For example,\nthe gateway of\
    \ the communication layer contains the device information of object layer.\nWhen\
    \ the application layer needs data, the gateway can retrieve the data from a speciﬁc\n\
    device as required. The application layer can also construct a digital model based\
    \ on the\ndevice distribution information from the gateway.\nThe application layer\
    \ includes a digital representation of the gateways from the phys-\nical system,\
    \ which contains device information from the object layer; it communicates\nbetween\
    \ the application layer and the object layer through the communication layer.\
    \ In the\napplication layer, the AI model is trained based on the data collected\
    \ from the object layer,\nand the trained model is stored in the data storage\
    \ for future use. If the physical state of the\nobject layer changes, the application\
    \ layer can send commands to some actuators in the ob-\nject layer to control\
    \ the grid based on the current data and the trained model. If the physical\n\
    components of the object layer change, the AI model can perform model updates\
    \ to reﬂect\nthe changes as well. The end user layer uses the information processed\
    \ by the application\nlayer to provide services for end users, including smart\
    \ grid management systems, smart\ncharging systems for autonomous vehicles, and\
    \ hybrid energy management systems.\nThere are a number of research efforts on\
    \ DT for the smart grid [38,39,68–71]. For\nexample, General Electric (GE) proposed\
    \ two models related to the use of DT in wind\nfarms [68,69]. In the object layer,\
    \ a communication network was designed to enable\nwind turbines to communicate\
    \ with each other. A wind turbine control system was also\nimplemented to control\
    \ one or more wind turbines. The middleware layer includes a cloud-\nbased infrastructure\
    \ with the support of the communication network so that the data (e.g.,\nstate\
    \ of turbines) can be collected and turbines can be remotely controlled via gateways.\
    \ It\nalso includes digital models that represent digital replicas of wind turbines.\
    \ The digital\nmodel can be updated based on the information extracted from the\
    \ object layer, and the\nwind farm can be controlled through an industrial gateway.\
    \ In addition, GE designed a\ngraphical user interface (GUI) in the application\
    \ layer to show the digital representation of\nthe wind farm and perform the control\
    \ and management operations of the wind farm.\nAhmed et al. [39] proposed a microgrid\
    \ DT model based on the IoT to mitigate cyber\nattacks. The object includes microgrid,\
    \ local controller, and area controller. Real-time\nbalancing algorithms were\
    \ implemented in each controller. If some microgrids are attacked\nand go ofﬂine,\
    \ the area controller can obtain information, and the balancing algorithm will\n\
    not transfer more power to the ofﬂine area based on the tampered data. This architecture\n\
    can also mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and false injection\
    \ attacks.\nLikewise, Nikolaos et al. [38] used DT to manage a large number of\
    \ devices in the smart\ngrid system. To be speciﬁc, they used the spike neural\
    \ network (SNN) deployed on\nthe smart meter in the grid to detect fault nodes.\
    \ A transient state estimator (TSE) was\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n12 of 25\n\
    designed to reveal the dynamic state of the smart grid. William et al. [70] leveraged\
    \ deep\nlearning algorithms to analyze data from the supervisory control and data\
    \ acquisition\nsystem (SCADA) to assist the DT in detecting physical faults in\
    \ the smart grid system.\nLikewise, Payam et al. [71] proposed a DT framework\
    \ with artiﬁcial neural networks\n(ANN) for distributed smart grids to ensure\
    \ real-time model generation, veriﬁcation,\nand identiﬁcation.\n3.3. Smart Transportation\n\
    The smart transportation system can be regarded as a CPS, which provides a va-\n\
    riety of services for the transportation domain, including trafﬁc management control.\n\
    Some applications in smart transportation systems include toll payment, vehicle\
    \ operation,\nemergency, vehicle control and safety management, and maintenance\
    \ and construction\nmanagement [6,72,73]. Since the smart transportation system\
    \ requires real-time data trans-\nmission and analysis capabilities to implement\
    \ time-sensitive services such as autonomous\nvehicles, it is difﬁcult for traditional\
    \ models to complete model training under massive\ndata within a short time. It\
    \ is additionally challenging for traditional smart transportation\nsystems to\
    \ complete the collection and aggregation of all sensor data within a short time.\n\
    In this case, the DT model can use high performance cloud/edge servers in the\
    \ digital\nsystem to conduct data aggregation and model training so that real-time\
    \ processing and\ntransmission can be achieved.\nBased on the architecture of\
    \ the DT that we have discussed, DT in the transportation\nsystem consists of\
    \ four layers. The object layer contains the components of the infrastructure\n\
    and participants (e.g., drivers), including sensors on the vehicle, trafﬁc cameras,\
    \ and other\ntrafﬁc sensors. The communication layer uses a variety of gateways\
    \ to process sensor data\nfrom the object layer, and handle data transmission\
    \ between the object and application\nlayers. The application layer maps the gateway\
    \ from the communication layer to realize\ndata transmission between the communication\
    \ layer and the application layer. Based on\nthe data and sensor information from\
    \ the gateway, the DT can use ML/DL technology\nto train the model and store it\
    \ in data storage. The end-user layer can navigate based\non the data processed\
    \ by the application layer, assist the driving of autonomous vehicles,\nand cooperate\
    \ with smart cities and smart grids to reduce transportation costs, reduce\nenergy\
    \ consumption, and make the charging process of electric vehicles more efﬁcient.\n\
    There have been some research efforts on DT-driven smart transportation. For example,\n\
    Peter et al. [74] proposed a scheme for DT-driven smart transportation that attempts\
    \ to\noptimize trafﬁc ﬂows in urban areas. The proposed smart transportation system\
    \ includes an\nAI model, a digital replica of the road network, and various trafﬁc\
    \ control and management\nservices. The system obtains data from the object layer,\
    \ including trafﬁc lights, sensors,\nand cameras. After the smart transportation\
    \ system processes the data, it will build an\napplication at the end-user layer\
    \ based on the collected data, which is called the city service\ninformation system.\
    \ Then, operators can manage the entire system at a high level based on\nthe end\
    \ user’s application. Additionally, Sagar et al. [75] proposed a DT-based adaptive\n\
    trafﬁc signal control (ATSC) to reduce the waiting time at intersections, thereby\
    \ improving\nthe driver’s driving experience. In that study, the Urban Trafﬁc\
    \ Simulation (SUMO) was\nused as the simulation platform.\nAdditionally, Wang\
    \ et al. [76] designed a DT-based veriﬁcation platform to perform\nveriﬁcation\
    \ between different metro systems. The object domain includes operation center;\n\
    trackside and train information is collected, and data is transmitted to the DT\
    \ system of the\napplication layer through various communication protocols, including\
    \ 4G, 5G, Ethernet,\nand NB-IoT. The DT platform uses ML/DL, data fusion, and\
    \ data modeling to analyze all\ndata and assist the end-user level in scheduling,\
    \ train monitoring, pedestrian monitoring,\netc. Sahal et al. [77] proposed a\
    \ DT structure combined with blockchain to enable DT-\nbased intelligent transportation\
    \ systems to achieve interoperability, identity veriﬁcation,\ndistributed ML/decision-making,\
    \ and scalability and robustness. Likewise, Guo et al. [78]\ndemonstrated a DT-based\
    \ 3D collaborative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) to visualize\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2022, 14, 64\n13 of 25\nreal-time road data and use LIDAR as road sensors. They\
    \ used the ROS bridge as a\ncommunication protocol to communicate between the\
    \ physical and virtual worlds.\n3.4. Smart Manufacturing\nThe smart manufacturing\
    \ system, as a general concept, is the integration of traditional\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems and processes with information communication technologies to\nenable\
    \ advanced intelligence and process optimization and automation. The demands\n\
    of current manufacturing systems can be complex in nature, due to the challenges\
    \ of\nscalability, efﬁciency, delivery, or design requirements [79]. The smart\
    \ manufacturing\nsystem is the utilization of emerging technologies to massively\
    \ optimize production in\nterms of throughput, efﬁciency, precision, loss, resource\
    \ consumption, scale, and value [7].\nTraditional manufacturing systems are comprised\
    \ of shop ﬂoor hardware that works\nas a unit to streamline the production of\
    \ a deliverable product. In contrast, the smart\nmanufacturing system integrates\
    \ communication and computing technologies to utilize\ninformation generated from\
    \ traditional manufacturing systems to make a more complete\nrepresentation of\
    \ a product life cycle. The application of IoT to industrial systems, or Indus-\n\
    try 4.0, relies on technologies such as sensing, control, communication, computing,\
    \ and data\nscience to support information ﬂows between different components of\
    \ the manufacturing\nsystem, allowing for better system interoperability and use.\n\
    One major limitation in manufacturing systems is the ability to automate and mass\n\
    produce in a manner that is efﬁcient and cost-effective. With the shifting paradigm\
    \ in\nmanufacturing of custom user deliverables, there is an increased challenge\
    \ to provide\ncustom solutions in a method that can be massively produced by manufacturing\
    \ systems.\nA common issue in manufacturing is the ability to generate a deliverable\
    \ that is ﬂexible to\nthe user’s needs while still maintaining automated systems\
    \ that can quickly and efﬁciently\ncreate products. At scale, it is often difﬁcult\
    \ to analyze how changing requirements in\nthe product design or supply chain\
    \ will impact variables such as cost and production\ntimelines while retaining\
    \ quality and efﬁciency. Additionally, adoption rates are going\nto be a challenge\
    \ for manufacturing environments that are looking to incorporate smart\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems in their product life-cycle. A core technology for enabling smart\n\
    manufacturing is the availability of information from the physical objects (i.e.,\
    \ shop ﬂoor\nequipment) through IoT sensors connected to IoT networking infrastructure.\n\
    Implementation of DT in the smart manufacturing system can help evaluate the\n\
    effectiveness of large-scale production environments by utilizing models for analyzing\n\
    production efﬁciency and design factors. The link between the virtual and physical\
    \ rep-\nresentation of a manufacturing system (i.e., in the way of DT) can determine\
    \ whether a\ndesign is going to be cost-effective by integrating with decision\
    \ support systems such as\nsupply chain management and timeline forecasts. The\
    \ integration of smart supply chain\ntechnologies involves a real-time link between\
    \ the production environment and the sup-\npliers and distribution centers to\
    \ determine the deliverable dates [80]. Determining the\navailability of materials\
    \ required for manufacturing production will allow the system to\ngenerate a cost\
    \ model and timeline for delivering a ﬁnal product.\nMonitoring the physical production\
    \ environment with DT systems can allow for the\nreal-time analysis of system\
    \ health on physical things (i.e., equipment, tools, and hardware)\nand prevent\
    \ delays based on environmental factors. In the event of an anomaly detection\n\
    on a manufacturing system, the DT model can determine whether the work load should\
    \ be\nrerouted to another system in the manufacturing line to avoid delays in\
    \ production [81].\nIoT sensors in manufacturing equipment allow for real-time\
    \ monitoring, enabling the de-\ntection of events that could cause breakdowns\
    \ in the manufacturing system and providing\nalternative scenarios for maintaining\
    \ system efﬁciency to prevent delays in production\ntimelines [82].\nSince smart\
    \ manufacturing can apply to many different levels of technologies in\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems, it is important to consider the level of adoption for technologies\
    \ in\nIndustry 4.0 scenarios. For example, Frank et al. [80] analyzed different\
    \ levels of adoption\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n14 of 25\nin several different\
    \ manufacturing domains and concluded that the implementation of\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ technologies is interrelated and provides potential beneﬁts when more systems\n\
    are integrated with smart manufacturing processes. Additionally, the utilization\
    \ of both\nfront-end technologies and base technologies could provide more complete\
    \ integration\nbetween physical systems and virtual representations that can better\
    \ handle the challenges\nof requirement complexity and decision support systems.\n\
    With the support from the communication layer and techniques to enable data aggre-\n\
    gation, DT implementation can help with the following scenarios in a smart manufacturing\n\
    system. The ﬁrst scenario is the detection of fault tolerance and device health,\
    \ which can\nhelp smart manufacturing systems to avoid outages by predicting device\
    \ failures and\nrerouting workﬂows in the production process. In particular, cloud-based\
    \ frameworks\nthat are designed to handle large amounts of data utilize embedded\
    \ sensor systems in\nmanufacturing devices in order to monitor system health,\
    \ leading to the creation of pre-\ndictive models for avoidance procedures [83].\
    \ In the example of a robotic gripper in a\nmanufacturing production line, Redelinghuys\
    \ et al. [82] investigated anomaly detection in\nthe gripper closing speed for\
    \ detecting via pressure sensor to detect faults and degradation\nthat could lead\
    \ to failure and considered utilizing the result to reroute production trafﬁc\
    \ to\nanother assembly line. This type of fault detection compares recent samples\
    \ to historical\ndata and builds a model that determines when a device is likely\
    \ to fail in a production\nenvironment, enabling the automated scheduling of preventative\
    \ maintenance.\nThe second scenario is supporting supply chain management, which\
    \ involves the\nintegration of DT systems and the communication of real-time data\
    \ between suppliers and\ndistribution centers. The tracking of products can be\
    \ integrated into the supplier systems to\ninform the manufacturer system and\
    \ can be integrated with the customer-facing deliverable\nto accurately determine\
    \ product delivery timelines and end-to-end supply chain logistics.\nThe tracking\
    \ of goods required for a customer deliverable can be remotely monitored and\n\
    integrated between supplier and manufacturer systems to determine the availability\
    \ of\ngoods required to produce a product [84]. In the event that a good required\
    \ for a custom\ndeliverable is not available, the decision support system can\
    \ determine whether there is a\nmore suitable supplier for the product and whether\
    \ it would be cost-efﬁcient to utilize a\ndifferent supplier. By generating a\
    \ pricing and timeline model for the availability of goods,\nthe manufacturer\
    \ can determine whether the product is worth producing and provide an\naccurate\
    \ cost analysis to the customer.\nNote that one of the emerging challenges of\
    \ manufacturing systems is the ability to\ncreate highly customized products in\
    \ a manner that is efﬁcient. Manufacturing in general is\noften focused on the\
    \ mass production of a good or product in order to decrease the cost and\neffort\
    \ required per unit. This type of mass production is often associated with processes\n\
    that are easily automated to speed up the production time. With the shifting paradigm\n\
    of manufacturing trending towards more customized deliverables [85], product variety\n\
    becomes a factor when designing production systems that will maintain efﬁciency\
    \ while\nstill meeting diverse customer requirements. Integration with DT systems\
    \ can allow for\nthe application of ML/DL algorithms and modeling technologies\
    \ to determine whether a\ncustom deliverable requirement is feasible in a given\
    \ manufacturing system. Manufacturing\nsystems need to be both ﬂexible and efﬁcient\
    \ in order to be useful for custom deliverable\nobjectives [86].\nThere are some\
    \ existing research efforts on the evolution of smart manufacturing\nconcepts\
    \ and the best way to apply DT technologies for more robust manufacturing sys-\n\
    tems [30,86–88]. For example, Lu et al. [86] reviewed the standards utilized in\
    \ smart\nmanufacturing systems, applied their research toward the production of\
    \ new standards,\nand further envisioned scenarios for smart manufacturing systems,\
    \ some of which can\nbeneﬁt from the application of DT systems. Kritzinger et\
    \ al. [30] took the application of\nsmart manufacturing one step further by studying\
    \ the application of DT as an enabling\ntechnology for Industry 4.0. Likewise,\
    \ Brennet et al. [87] discussed the convergence of digi-\nFuture Internet 2022,\
    \ 14, 64\n15 of 25\ntal and physical systems for Industry 4.0 through the application\
    \ of Personalized Product\nEmergence Processes (PPEP) and additive manufacturing\
    \ technologies.\nFurthermore, the implementation of DT in smart manufacturing\
    \ systems was inves-\ntigated [81,89,90]. For example, Tao et al. [89] summarized\
    \ the deployment structure of\nDT for smart manufacturing based on the concept\
    \ of DT Workshop, which enables digital\nsystems and physical systems to synchronize\
    \ with one another. In this case, the digital\nsystem can be virtualized based\
    \ on data from the physical system, and the physical system\ncan be optimized\
    \ based on the instructions from the digital system. In order to better\nexplain\
    \ how to deploy Digital Twin Shop-Floor (DTS), DTS was divided into four parts:\n\
    physical shop-ﬂoor, virtual shop-ﬂoor, shop-ﬂoor service system, and shop-ﬂoor\
    \ DT. Like-\nwise, Kamil et al. [90] implemented a DT in an experimental assembly\
    \ quality production\ninspection system. In particular, they used radio-frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation (RFID) and cam-\neras in the physical system and used a programmable\
    \ logic controller (PLC) system to\ncollect data. The OPC UA framework was considered\
    \ to transfer data between the physical\nsystem and the digital system. The digital\
    \ model consists of a 3D model created in CAD\ndesign software and is simulated\
    \ and virtualized using the Tecnomatix platform. The cloud\nplatform was integrated\
    \ into the digital system for data analysis so that the assembly\nquality inspection\
    \ could be realized without stopping the manufacturing process. Open-\nsource\
    \ technology can also beneﬁt the development of applying DT in smart manufacturing\n\
    scenarios. For example, Aghenta et al. [91] proposed a low-cost IoT-based SCADA\
    \ system\nsolution. In addition to providing the basic functions of a traditional\
    \ SCADA system, this\nparticular system can not only support data acquisition,\
    \ transmission, and presentation\nbut also the monitoring and control of physical\
    \ objects.\n3.5. Smart Cities\nThe objective of the smart city is to leverage\
    \ information communication and data-\nrelated technologies so that resources\
    \ can be efﬁciently used, leading to better quality of\nlife, reduction of resource\
    \ input, etc. So far, the majority of focus has been on government\nand energy\
    \ initiatives, followed by transportation, building, and water, among other goals.\n\
    A number of research and development efforts on smart cities and DT applications\
    \ have\nbeen generated [92–96]. Similar to smart manufacturing, smart cities are\
    \ the combination\nof a wide range of IoT domains to address the complex challenges\
    \ in cities and must\nincorporate cloud/edge computing with big data collection\
    \ and analysis as essential\ntechniques to drive the realization of efﬁciency\
    \ and optimization [11,97].\nIt should be noted that the development of the smart\
    \ city has involved several op-\nportunities and challenges: (i) people’s expectations\
    \ are constantly changing. How can\npeople’s expectations be accounted for when\
    \ they are frequently and forever changing,\neven when real-time communication\
    \ is a reality? How can the change in expectation be\nevaluated? (ii) How can\
    \ the latest technologies be utilized to improve the efﬁciency of\nour government?\
    \ How can we forecast outcomes and avoid potential losses or mistakes?\nHow can\
    \ we mitigate the risks? These questions have become the urgent issues that a\n\
    government must consider with respect to smart cities. Similar to numerous practices\n\
    in smart manufacturing, in smart cities, we could leverage DT to detect and address\
    \ a\nproblem before it arises, reducing cost, rather than attempting to solve\
    \ a problem after it\nhas occurred. If the results from the DT match the expectation,\
    \ data can be transferred to\nreal physical objects to implement the changes in\
    \ a fast and seamless way.\nSome efforts toward integrating DT with smart cities\
    \ have already been made [98–103].\nFor example, Deng et al. [98] reviewed some\
    \ key technologies in Digital Twin City (DTCs),\nsuch as surveying and mapping,\
    \ building information model, IoT, next-generation wireless\nnetworking, and blockchain.\
    \ Shahat et al. [99] reviewed some challenges of DT cities and\ndiscussed some\
    \ research that leveraged DT into smart cities. Note that while the city DT\n\
    cannot provide solutions for addressing problems in cities, DT can provide beneﬁts\
    \ in\nseveral areas. In order to demonstrate the performance of DT, it is necessary\
    \ to conduct\nresearch on data collection, data management, the utilization of\
    \ big data, virtual reality\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n16 of 25\n(VR), IoT,\
    \ and 3D Modeling. Likewise, Shirowzhan et al. [100] discussed technologies\n\
    that can be useful for enabling smarter cities. They identiﬁed trends in geospatial\
    \ science,\nparticularly in the application of geographic information system (GIS),\
    \ and observed the\nimpacts of newly developed online applications such as ArcGIS\
    \ Urban.\nMore and more smart cities around the world are embracing DT to replicate\
    \ its\nperformance and response to changes. By the year 2020, 118 cities were\
    \ using DT in Smart\nCity projects and systems. Cities are also using DT to reduce\
    \ carbon dioxide emissions and\nmanage trafﬁc efﬁciently. According to ABI Research,\
    \ DT could assist cities in carrying out\ncost-effective urban resource planning\
    \ [104]. We believe that DT has the potential to further\nimprove upon the already\
    \ signiﬁcant gains that it has achieved.\n4. Challenges\nIntegrating DT into CPS\
    \ can not only improve the efﬁcient operation of CPS through\nincreased intelligence,\
    \ it can also assist CPS in providing more valuable service to end-\nusers. Recall\
    \ that as DT is a digital replicate of physical things, it is critical to make\
    \ DT\ncapable of representing a variety of things in a timely, accurate, and efﬁcient\
    \ manner.\nThe realization of such a DT raises numerous challenges to the networking,\
    \ computing,\ncontrol, and data analysis of IoT. Furthermore, the design of DT\
    \ shall consider the numerous\nexceptional requirements of CPS (e.g., latency,\
    \ reliability, safety, scalability, security, and\nprivacy). To address such challenges,\
    \ designing DT offers opportunities for novel and\ninterdisciplinary research\
    \ efforts.\n4.1. CPS Challenges\nAs a complex system that requires the coordination\
    \ of network, computing, and con-\ntrol, CPS has strict performance requirements\
    \ in different application scenarios. Generally\nspeaking, CPS applications require\
    \ very low latency, high reliability, and large scalability.\nTaking the smart\
    \ transportation system as an example, suppose we are designing applica-\ntions\
    \ related to autonomous driving. Vehicles need to be able to quickly collect pertinent\n\
    information. This information includes data collected by sensors, transmitted\
    \ through the\nInternet of Vehicles, and so on. Then, the vehicle needs to process\
    \ this data quickly, extract\nusable information, and control the vehicle according\
    \ to the determined situation at the\ntime. Since vehicle driving is closely related\
    \ to personal safety, there is no doubt that the\nreliability of autonomous driving\
    \ is our primary consideration. The issues that we need to\nconsider include network\
    \ failures, computing hardware failures, and many more.\nMoreover, because the\
    \ number of vehicles in each scenario will be different, we need\nto ensure the\
    \ scalability of the autonomous driving application that we design to handle\n\
    the problems caused by the large number of vehicles, such as network congestion\
    \ and high\ncontrol algorithm complexity. From this example, we can conclude that\
    \ the performance\nrequirements of CPS are very strict. The overall performance\
    \ of CPS is the result of multiple\nsubsystem (network, computing, and control)\
    \ interactions and is synthesized within the\nCPS. This interaction means that\
    \ any slight change in the performance of any one subsystem\ncan have a compounding\
    \ effect on the performance of other subsystems, thereby causing a\ncomplex impact\
    \ on the performance of the entire CPS system. Thus, when building a DT\nfor CPS,\
    \ it is challenging to not only meet all these strict performance requirements\
    \ but also\nto reﬂect the interactions between the various subsystems in a timely\
    \ manner.\n4.2. Data Science Challenges\nBuilding the DT of a complex system itself\
    \ is very challenging, involving mathematical\nmodeling and data analysis. There\
    \ are two major approaches to building an accurate DT:\nmodel-driven and data-driven.\
    \ When we adopt the model-driven approach, we use\nmathematical models to represent\
    \ physical systems. Therefore, knowing how to build\na mathematical model that\
    \ accurately represents a complex physical system in CPS is a\nchallenging problem.\
    \ Since there are many variables involved in the physical system of\nCPS, the\
    \ mathematical model will be signiﬁcantly complicated, typically with properties\n\
    Future Internet 2022, 14, 64\n17 of 25\nsuch as non-linearity, highly-coupled,\
    \ and time-variance. When we adopt a data-driven\napproach, we collect massive\
    \ amounts of data from the physical system that reﬂects its\nstatus over time.\
    \ The process of collecting and selecting these data poses some challenges.\n\
    First of all, in CPS, one type of data may be collected from multiple sources,\
    \ and the\nhardware conditions of these sources will be different, such that it\
    \ is difﬁcult to ensure that\nthe quality of all data is the same. Second, the\
    \ storage and transmission of this massive\namount of data creates signiﬁcant\
    \ overhead to the system. In order to truly reﬂect the\ntimely updates of the\
    \ physical system, we often sample the state of the physical system\nat a very\
    \ high frequency, and these data require considerable storage space and pose\n\
    signiﬁcant overhead for networking and computing infrastructures with strict performance\n\
    requirements. Therefore, one fundamental data science problem is how to collect\
    \ the\nleast amount of data without signiﬁcantly and negatively impacting the\
    \ efﬁcacy of DT.\nIn conclusion, how to effectively construct a DT for the complex\
    \ system with the least\namount of data is a challenging problem that needs to\
    \ consider both mathematical modeling\nand data science aspects.\n4.3. Optimization\
    \ Challenges\nRealizing a DT in CPS that accounts for the interactions of computing,\
    \ control, commu-\nnication, and data analysis modules in an end-to-end chain\
    \ is challenging. The communica-\ntion resource allocation algorithms, such as\
    \ time and frequency resource scheduling, are\nvery complex, especially when combined\
    \ with massively distributed networking devices\nand low latency requirements.\
    \ In addition, the computing resource allocation, such as\ntask-ofﬂoading in an\
    \ edge/cloud computing architecture, is another optimization problem\nwith stringent\
    \ performance constraints. Furthermore, the control mechanism, possibly\nevent-triggered\
    \ or time-triggered control, or both, yields still another optimization prob-\n\
    lem. In addition, analysis of the collected data is highly complex, requiring\
    \ prodigious\nfeature extraction, and training (or at least validation), coupled\
    \ with potentially continual\nprediction or classiﬁcation to satisfy real-time\
    \ requirements.\nThe DT is a combination of the real-time computing, real-time\
    \ control, and real-time\ncommunication, which generates the joint/integrated\
    \ optimization problem of computing,\ncontrol, and communication. Consider VR-supported\
    \ smart manufacturing as an example.\nFirst, we need to deliver massive amounts\
    \ of sensing data with required latency. Then,\nwe need to use the graphics engine\
    \ to generate the digital model in real time. Finally, we\nneed to execute the\
    \ control command within the latency constraint. Since any problem in\nthis chain\
    \ will directly affect the performance of the other, even in a centralized system\n\
    with superior hardware conditions, it is very challenging to perform joint optimization\n\
    on this VR system. Further, the distributed system of CPS only makes the problem\
    \ of\njoint optimization much harder. For example, in our previous work [105],\
    \ we adopted\ndeep reinforcement learning to help conﬁgure the network and dynamically\
    \ change the\nsensor sampling rate at the same time to improve the control performance\
    \ of a distributed\nsmart manufacturing system. However, by introducing DT to\
    \ the CPS, there are more\nprocesses that need to be considered. For example,\
    \ in the control process, there are two\nprocesses, such as the domain expert\
    \ controlling DT and DT controlling the physical objects.\nThe computing of DT\
    \ in CPS needs to consider three computing processes, such as the\ncomputing process\
    \ of generating a digital copy of a physical object, the computing process\nof\
    \ the interaction between DTs in a simulated scenario, and the computing process\
    \ of actual\nCPS tasks. The communication of DT in CPS needs to consider the communication\
    \ between\nthe physical object and the virtual clone, the communication between\
    \ the DT and other\nDTs, and the communication between the DT and the human control\
    \ interface. These extra\nprocesses make the optimization problem more difﬁcult\
    \ to solve.\nTaking into account the limited resources of the CPS system, we also\
    \ need to optimize\nthe large amount of data generated in these processes from\
    \ the perspective of data gen-\neration, data storage, and data transmission.\
    \ From a data generation perspective, when\nwe generate the data needed to build\
    \ a DT in CPS, the quality of the data is a major issue.\nFuture Internet 2022,\
    \ 14, 64\n18 of 25\nBecause we need to deploy a massive number of CPS devices,\
    \ the hardware conditions of a\nsingle CPS device are often very limited. In addition,\
    \ in the CPS environment, one type\nof data may be collected by multiple sources.\
    \ Thus, how to effectively select data sources\nfor different CPS applications\
    \ is a challenging problem. From a data storage perspective,\nwhen we are building\
    \ the DT, in order to truly reﬂect the timely update of physical objects,\nwe\
    \ often sample the state of physical objects at a relatively high frequency. Inevitably,\n\
    an incredible volume of data will be collected on the DT server side. On one hand,\
    \ these\ndata can be used to assist in the development of other DT systems; on\
    \ the other hand, these\ndata take up signiﬁcant storage space. Because there\
    \ is not a simple linear relationship\nbetween the amount of stored data and the\
    \ performance of the DT system, the question of\nhow to accurately select useful\
    \ data for storage has always been difﬁcult to answer. From a\ndata transmission\
    \ perspective, due to the heterogeneity of CPS systems, IoT/CPS devices\nuse different\
    \ communication technologies. When we need to transmit data between these\ndevices,\
    \ we usually deploy a gateway with various radio interfaces for data exchange.\
    \ This\nsolution will bring additional hardware costs and potential network bottlenecks.\
    \ Con-\nsidering that the DT system has very strict requirements on timing and\
    \ latency, it is very\nchallenging to design networking infrastructure to support\
    \ real-time communications so\nthat the information between different components\
    \ can be delivered quickly and efﬁciently.\n4.4. Security and Privacy Challenges\n\
    We now discuss the security and privacy challenges. Since DT needs to update the\n\
    state of physical objects in real time through network communications, DT will\
    \ be subject\nto cyber attacks, such as integrity attacks on physical hardware\
    \ and sensors, transmission,\nand digital systems. Taking the data integrity attack\
    \ as an example, the adversary can\ndirectly attack IoT devices as data collectors,\
    \ causing them to upload invalid/misleading\ndata. Alternatively, an adversary\
    \ can attack the gateway, to which the IoT device uploads\ndata, mixing the invalid/misleading\
    \ data with the correct data collected by IoT devices.\nFinally, the adversary\
    \ could directly inject false data into the DT. Because the DT and\nphysical objects\
    \ are closely connected, any one of these attacks will yield a signiﬁcant\nimpact\
    \ on the integrity of the entire system.\nAdditionally, from the perspective of\
    \ conﬁdentiality, the DT applications contain\na large amount of privacy-sensitive\
    \ information, such as medical records, autonomous\nvehicle sensing information,\
    \ and real-time smart grid operation information. Therefore,\nit is not only necessary\
    \ to implement an authentication mechanism for physical objects\nbut also an authentication\
    \ mechanism for digital communication and machine-to-machine\ntransmission. Nonetheless,\
    \ it can be costly to implement authentication mechanisms on\nlow-energy IoT devices.\
    \ In this case, knowing how to handle the authentication process\non devices with\
    \ limited power has become a challenge. From a usability point of view,\nDT applications\
    \ rely on sensor information from the object layer to help the DT build\nthe digital\
    \ clone of the physical system. In this case, adversaries can launch attacks on\n\
    sensor or gateway, such as a denial of service (DoS) attack or malware propagation.\
    \ Once\nthe gateway or sensor is compromised, it is difﬁcult for DT to obtain\
    \ the overall states of\nthe physical system. For this reason, it is important\
    \ to propose and validate mitigation\nmechanisms to reduce the impact of such\
    \ attacks.\n5. Research Directions\nIn extending the DT to IoT scenarios, promising\
    \ new ﬁelds arise that are worthy of\nfurther investigation. We will discuss the\
    \ future research directions from the following as-\npects: performance, new DT-driven\
    \ services, modeling and machine learning, and security\nand privacy.\n5.1. Performance\n\
    As we discussed in Section 4, the DT in CPS has very strict performance requirements\n\
    to achieve real-time computing, real-time control, and real-time communication.\
    \ We believe\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n19 of 25\nthat the joint optimization\
    \ of sensing, control, networking, computing, and data analysis is\ncritically\
    \ important for DT to meet these performance requirements. There have been some\n\
    works focused on one of these optimization targets (sensing, control, networking,\
    \ or data\nanalysis), and some results have been achieved. However, if we need\
    \ to maximize the\noverall performance of the system, we must study the interaction\
    \ between all components\nand design a joint optimization strategy. Taking the\
    \ intelligent transportation system as\nan example, suppose we are generating\
    \ DT for moving vehicles in a certain area to better\nmanage trafﬁc. We use sensor\
    \ data from both vehicles and cities to build DT. When we\nselect data, simply\
    \ having more data is not optimal. Instead, the pre-processing of the data\nshould\
    \ account for the quality of the data, the bandwidth of the network, the computing\n\
    power of the infrastructure, and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of\
    \ the speciﬁc\napplication. Similarly, when we are transmitting the data, we need\
    \ to consider not only\nthe current communication environment but also the mobility\
    \ of the vehicle, and the data\nstorage space of the vehicle, among others.\n\
    5.2. New DT-Driven Services\nBy combining DT and IoT search services, we can interconnect\
    \ different CPS systems\nand provide more services. Speciﬁcally, the DT bridges\
    \ CPS in disparate domains, such\nas transportation, energy, and manufacturing,\
    \ to obtain a ubiquitous connection. The DT\nenables more data sharing to create\
    \ abundant content that improves the IoT search results.\nFor example, the DT\
    \ bridges electric cars that primarily consume energy with the smart grid\nthat\
    \ primarily generates and stores electricity. With DT, electric cars can obtain\
    \ seamless\nand efﬁcient energy supply via the information from digitized charging\
    \ piles, solar planes,\nand so on. IoT search services such as location-based\
    \ search and content-based search can\nalso help us ﬁnd IoT devices and data to\
    \ build DTs [48,106]. This is particularly important\nin the rapidly changing\
    \ CPS environment.\nFor example, in the smart transportation system, suppose we\
    \ are using smart cameras\nto build digital clones of vehicles. After a few seconds,\
    \ the vehicle drives out of the range\nof the smart camera. We can use the location-based\
    \ IoT search service to ﬁnd other cameras\naround the vehicle to ensure that DT\
    \ can continue to work. As another example, if we want\nto know the moving trajectory\
    \ of vehicle, we can use a content-based IoT search service to\nﬁnd all the information\
    \ that contains the vehicle license plate. Finally, some new services\ncan be\
    \ provided by DT on different CPS. For example, in the smart manufacturing system,\n\
    operators can check DT through algorithms to quickly perform quality inspections\
    \ on a\nlarge number of products. In the smart home, users can integrate smart\
    \ cameras and VR\ndevices to provide holographic remote social interaction. In\
    \ the smart grid, DT can be used\nto monitor the status of infrastructures in\
    \ real time. In smart health care, DT can be used to\nmonitor and record the vital\
    \ signs of patients so that doctors can make better treatment\nplans. Likewise,\
    \ in the smart transportation system, DT can be used to dynamically plan\nroutes\
    \ and provide additional driving assistance functions such as blind spot monitoring,\n\
    brake warning, etc.\n5.3. Modeling and Machine Learning\nConsidering the challenges\
    \ of modeling a complex system in Section 4.2, a modeling\nmethodology that can\
    \ be adapted to different CPS systems is worth studying. There are\ntwo major\
    \ directions that should be investigated: model-based DT and model-free DT.\n\
    For model-based DT, the main problem is that the CPS system is difﬁcult to mathe-\n\
    matically model, and there are signiﬁcant differences between different CPS. Therefore,\n\
    any model that works and is complete for one CPS will need to be re-modeled every\
    \ time\nthe CPS changes. To address this problem, one solution is modular DT.\
    \ This focuses on\nbuilding the DT of the small objects of the system and combining\
    \ them to form the DT of\nthe entire system, instead of building the entire system\
    \ from the beginning. This not only\nreduces the complexity of building a DT model\
    \ but also uses the constructed DT models to\ncreate a different combination DT\
    \ systems.\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n20 of 25\nIn model-free DT, we establish\
    \ DT by frequently collecting information on physical\nobjects. Because this kind\
    \ of DT completely relies on observations and disregards mathe-\nmatical model\
    \ support, it is difﬁcult for us to predict the state of the system, which greatly\n\
    affects the control and optimization of the DT system. Therefore, we consider\
    \ using DL to\ngenerate a neural network-based model by learning data collected\
    \ from the CPS devices.\nIn this case, even for very complex systems that are\
    \ difﬁcult to model, we can still use DL\nmodels to build DT. Nonetheless, one\
    \ problem is that ML/DL algorithms usually require a\nlarge amount of data, which\
    \ is sometimes difﬁcult to provide for CPS devices with limited\nresources. Therefore,\
    \ it is worth investigating the best way to design DL models that\nwork for small\
    \ amounts of data. Moreover, training a DL model requires considerable\ncomputing\
    \ power, and trained models need to be retrained once the environment changes,\n\
    both of which are obviously too demanding for CPS devices. To solve these problems,\
    \ we\nbelieve that using transfer learning is a promising solution [107]. Transfer\
    \ learning is an ML\ntechnology that can transfer the learned knowledge from one\
    \ a well-trained model to a new\nlearning model. Speciﬁcally, with transfer learning,\
    \ we can use a generic DL model trained\nwith large amount of the data as the\
    \ source model and replace several of the last (terminal)\nlayers in the network\
    \ to construct a new model. During the training phase, we only update\nthe replaced\
    \ layers. By using this transfer learning technique, we can use less training\
    \ data\nto obtain better performance than training from scratch. Because there\
    \ are fewer network\nparameters that need to be trained, this method also reduces\
    \ the requirements for device\ncomputing power and storage space. Therefore, it\
    \ is suitable for real-time computing,\nreal-time control, and real-time communication\
    \ in a large-scale distributed CPS system.\nFinally, we should consider the integration\
    \ of model-based DT and model-free DT\ninto a hybrid-model DT. Even in the most\
    \ complex cps system, there will be components\nthat can be easily mathematically\
    \ modeled. Therefore, we can mathematically model those\ncomponents of the system\
    \ that are easily modeled and use a model-free approach such as\nDL to model the\
    \ remaining components. Once a DL-based model is trained, it can be treated\n\
    as a modular model and directly integrated with other model-based DTs in a modular\n\
    DT system. For example, in the smart transportation system, we can mathematically\n\
    model the mobility of vehicles and use DL to model the Internet of Vehicle communication.\n\
    By combining these two components together, we can obtain a complete DT of moving\n\
    vehicles in CPS.\n5.4. Security and Privacy\nDT applications rely on data provided\
    \ by IoT sensors and gateways. In this case, data\nand communication security\
    \ and privacy are an important research direction. In consider-\ning security,\
    \ we discuss the research from several perspectives: conﬁdentiality, integrity,\n\
    and availability.\nIn terms of conﬁdentiality, we now take the smart transportation\
    \ system as an example.\nDT obtains data from IoT sensors installed near roads,\
    \ vehicles, etc. At the same time, IoT\nsensors may belong to different organizations/operators.\
    \ In this case, different organiza-\ntions/operators need to ensure the conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data through some authentication\nand secured communication protocols. In\
    \ addition, some data stored in the application\nlayer, such as vehicle location\
    \ and trafﬁc camera data, are sensitive. Thus, access control\nneeds to be in\
    \ place to protect user privacy. At the same time, some information security\n\
    regulations can protect user privacy and achieve data conﬁdentiality by restricting\
    \ data\nsharing, especially on the end-user layer. For example, in the ﬁeld of\
    \ healthcare, Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) will\
    \ be used to regulate the sharing\nand conﬁdentiality of user medical data.\n\
    For the sake of integrity, some DT applications, including smart grid, smart transporta-\n\
    tion, smart manufacturing, and smart cities, require real-time data to build a\
    \ digital model\nof the DT system. In this case, data integrity is essential for\
    \ the DT system to correctly\nmodel and guide the physical system in response\
    \ to changes in the environment. Based\non the DT architecture, we discuss the\
    \ integrity of the four layers. For the object layer,\nFuture Internet 2022, 14,\
    \ 64\n21 of 25\nthe sensors need to communicate with the gateways. In this case,\
    \ the communication\nfrom sensor to gateway and gateway to sensor at the application\
    \ layer needs to be secured\nto prevent an adversary from hijacking the communication\
    \ using a man-in-the-middle\n(MITM) attack or others. In addition, authentication\
    \ and other security mechanisms must\nbe in place to restrict unauthorized users\
    \ from modifying data. At the same time, at the\napplication layer, anomaly detection\
    \ can be used to detect manipulated data to ensure data\nintegrity. Finally, an\
    \ authentication system can be implemented at the end user level to\nprevent unauthorized\
    \ users from accessing DT.\nFinally, availability is key to real-time DT. Certain\
    \ types of cyber attacks, including\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) and\
    \ malware propagation, can target sensors and\ngateways. In this case, mitigation\
    \ schemes need to be implemented on the gateways to\nﬁlter malicious trafﬁc and\
    \ reduce the impact of attacks. At the same time, an adversary can\nsend time-consuming\
    \ queries or massive queries through the end user layer to overload the\nDT. To\
    \ deal with such threats, mitigation schemes can be deployed at the application\
    \ layer\nto avert the affects. Moreover, in a certain period of time, there may\
    \ be multiple normal\nusers accessing the same service at the same time. In this\
    \ case, load balancing algorithms\ncan be deployed on the gateway. If a gateway\
    \ is overloaded, the algorithm can use nearby\nlow-load gateways to process the\
    \ request, leading to a highly resilient system.\n6. Final Remarks\nWith the rapid\
    \ advance of big data and ML/DL techniques, the cyber replica of a real\nphysical\
    \ system has been considered as a viable digital platform to emulate lifecycle\
    \ use\ncases for CPS. DT is the cyber replica of the real physical system, which\
    \ consists of real-time\ncomputing, real-time control, and real-time communication.\
    \ By leveraging the DT with\na physical system, we can imitate real-world cases\
    \ in physical systems, without directly\noperating the real-world system, to optimize\
    \ system performance. DT can also simulate\nemergency situations of the system,\
    \ allowing system operators to practice emergency plans.\nFurthermore, DT could\
    \ enable data sharing to support more data-oriented services on\nCPS. DT needs\
    \ to represent things in a timely, accurate, and efﬁcient manner, which poses\n\
    numerous challenges to the networking, control, computing, and data analysis of\
    \ CPS.\nFurthermore, the design of DT shall consider numerous exceptional requirements\
    \ of CPS\n(e.g., latency, reliability, safety, scalability, security, and privacy).\
    \ In this paper, we have\nﬁrst reviewed the principles of DT (architecture, data\
    \ presentation, and protocols). We\nhave then presented how to integrate DT in\
    \ different CPS, including smart grid, smart\ntransportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities. We have further discussed some\nchallenges from CPS, data\
    \ science, optimization, and security perspectives. Finally, we have\noutlined\
    \ future research directions from the perspectives of performance, new DT-driven\n\
    services, modeling and machine learning, and security and privacy.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: With a rising emphasis on public safety and quality of life, there is
    an urgent need to ensure

    optimal air quality, both indoors and outdoors. Detecting toxic gaseous compounds
    plays a pivotal role

    in shaping our sustainable future. This review aims to elucidate the advancements
    in smart wearable

    (nano)sensors for monitoring harmful gaseous pollutants, such as ammonia (NH3),
    nitric oxide (NO),

    nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide
    (CO2), hydrogen

    sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), hydrocarbons (CxHy), and hydrogen
    fluoride (HF).

    Differentiating this review from its predecessors, we shed light on the challenges
    faced in enhancing

    sensor performance and offer a deep dive into the evolution of sensing materials,
    wearable substrates,

    electrodes, and types of sensors. Noteworthy materials for robust detection systems
    encompass 2D

    nanostructures, carbon nanomaterials, conducting polymers, nanohybrids, and metal
    oxide semicon-

    ductors. A dedicated section dissects the significance of circuit integration,
    miniaturization, real-time

    sensing, repeatability, reusability, power efficiency, gas-sensitive material
    deposition, selectivity, sensi-

    tivity, stability, and response/recovery time, pinpointing gaps in the current
    knowledge and offering

    avenues for further research. To conclude, we provide insights and suggestions
    for the prospective

    trajectory of smart wearable nanosensors in addressing the extant challenges.

    1. Introduction

    Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, the world is facing the problem
    of

    severe air pollution. This is witnessed by the increasingly large amounts of toxic
    and

    pollutant gases released into the environment, one of the negative aspects of
    the industrial

    revolution. The demand to improve public safety and quality of life due to the
    development

    of different industry sectors and the issues related to air pollution are signiﬁcantly
    growing.

    These pollutants usually contain toxic gases such as CO, SO2, NO2, and H2S that
    can harm

    humans, their surrounding atmosphere, and the environment through ozone depletion,

    acid rain, and the greenhouse effect [1]. The harmful effects of such gases on
    human health

    are so severe that industrial workers exposed to such gases need a safety gas
    alert system

    capable of detecting and quantifying harmful chemicals and gases. Detecting dangerous

    gases is becoming increasingly important for indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring
    in

    houses, ofﬁce buildings and factories, public safety, and mining and energy industries
    [2].

    Gas sensors are also widely used to measure greenhouse gases. Furthermore, studies

    are being undertaken to detect some of these gases in breath, including nitric
    oxide (NO),

    ethane, and NH3, for diagnostic applications. They also act as biomarkers for
    different

    pathologies [3,4]. The detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is thus
    of signiﬁcant

    importance [5]. There is a tremendous need for simple and portable sensors that
    can

    measure gases sensitively, selectively, and easily in real time to analyze gases
    efﬁciently. As

    a result, simple, on-site, real-time monitoring of air quality and pollutant content
    is vital

    for protecting human health from poisonous and dangerous gases. Meanwhile, there
    is

    also a need for such devices to safeguard human health in various situations,
    including

    food protection and public security. As a result, the demand for developing small-sized,

    lightweight, and portable sensing devices has drastically increased. The global
    gas sensors

    market is projected to reach USD 2.1 billion by 2027, growing at a compound annual

    growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9% [6]. For this purpose, numerous sensing techniques,
    such as

    calorimetric, thermoelectric, optical, and chromatographic methods, have been
    applied [7].

    However, most of these techniques have disadvantages, such as relatively high
    cost, low

    sensitivity and selectivity, poor design, and a need for additional equipment;
    some even

    lack portability [7].

    In terms of their mechanical properties, sensors can generally be categorized
    as either

    rigid, ﬂexible, or stretchable depending on the properties of the main substrate
    of the sensor.

    All three categories can be used in wearable applications, depending on the requirements

    and speciﬁcations (e.g., lifetime, duration of use, and mechanical perturbation
    that can

    be tolerated) of the application and the body area on which they are intended
    to be worn.

    Flexible and stretchable sensors can be composed of several rigid parts interconnected
    with

    ﬂexible/stretchable electrical interconnects in an island-bridge approach. Rigid
    substrates

    and devices can be thinned to make them ﬂexible to some extent, while use of intrinsically

    rigid devices can be worn on body areas not susceptible to mechanical deformations

    (bending) such as the lower back, the head, and areas away from joints. In addition,
    making

    a device sufﬁciently small compared to the scale of mechanical deformation and
    motion

    can render a rigid device wearable and insensitive to the motion of the body.
    For example,

    see Section 4.4 on microelectronics approaches. When device scales are larger
    than the

    body curvature, and not much mechanical deformation due to body motion is expected,

    ﬂexible devices are needed. However, when large deformations are expected as in
    joints

    and during exercise routines and sports, stretchability is required. In addition,
    large rigid

    devices, due to the signiﬁcant difference in their mechanical properties with
    skin and the

    underlying tissue, will lead to injuries for the wearer, while the rigid device
    will also become

    damaged and will malfunction. Consequently, when the overall sensing system size
    cannot

    be sufﬁciently small, the development of low-cost, ﬂexible, or stretchable wearable
    and

    high-performance ﬂexible gas sensors is necessary. Wearable sensors can also be
    integrated

    into clothing or accessories, in addition to being worn directly on the skin,
    depending on

    the needs of the intended use. In the past ten years, major developments have
    occurred in

    the wearable sensor research ﬁeld [8]. The market for wearable technology has
    experienced

    exponential growth in recent years. Wearable sensors allow the non-invasive monitoring
    of

    human activity and health. This has given access to vast amounts of information
    and new

    knowledge. The most popular wearable devices are ear-worn devices, smartwatches,
    and

    wristbands. These devices can easily connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth or
    a wireless

    network, enabling real-time data transmission, cloud computing, and big data analytics
    for

    large sensor networks and data, and remote monitoring [9]. With computational
    capabilities,

    on-node real-time information processing is becoming a reality. Wearable technologies

    can potentially improve occupational health and safety management, making real-time

    health and environmental data available to users, inspectors, and personnel responding
    to

    emergencies. This information can pertain to air pollution, indoor air quality,

    aerosols, or the identiﬁcation of biohazardous agents in the workplace, allowing
    informed

    decisions to be made [10]. Recent advances in smart wearable electronics and sensors

    are allowing more precise, less noisy, pervasive, and non-intrusive environmental
    data

    collection that can consistently monitor human physiology and environmental factors
    and

    are contributing to the rapid development and evolution of the Internet of Things
    (IoTs)

    that is currently underway [11].

    The realm of gas sensing has been extensively explored in several reviews [12–15].
    Yet,

    a comprehensive examination of wearable gas-sensing devices, along with their
    associated

    challenges, remains conspicuously absent, particularly from a holistic standpoint.
    This gap

    is noteworthy, especially as the future trajectory is evidently leaning towards
    the integration

    of gas sensing with smart wearable personalized technologies. Notably, there has
    been a

    review on the recent advancements in ﬂexible room-temperature gas sensors grounded

    on metal oxide semiconductors [16]. Furthermore, cutting-edge methodologies solely

    centered on metal-oxide-based heterostructures for room temperature gas sensors
    have

    been discussed [17]. Additionally, a detailed analysis has been undertaken regarding
    gas

    sensors and the dynamics that impact their sensing mechanisms, with a special
    emphasis on

    metal oxide semiconductors [18]. The uniqueness of our paper lies in its broad
    perspective,

    bridging the existing literature gap and highlighting the novel integration of
    wearable

    technology in the gas-sensing domain.

    This paper presents a cutting-edge review of advancements made since 2020 in the

    realm of smart wearable (nano)sensors tailored for the environmental monitoring
    of gaseous

    pollutants. Notably, this comprehensive survey underscores the pioneering nature
    of these

    wearables in tackling key challenges associated with their development and commercial-

    ization. These challenges encompass sensor sensitivity, selectivity, wearability,
    integration,

    miniaturization, cost implications, power consumption, and the quest for high-performance,

    biocompatible power supplies. Such power sources must closely align with the sensing

    device in terms of weight, ﬂexibility, durability, and other vital attributes
    [19].

    This review is systematically structured into distinct sections for ease of understanding:

    1.

    Gas-Sensing Materials: This section delves into a variety of materials, including
    2D

    nanostructures, carbon nanomaterials, conducting polymers (CPs), nanohybrids,
    and

    metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs).

    2.

    Wearable Substrates and Electrodes: Here, different substrates such as paper-based

    (PB) mediums, polymeric materials, textiles, and stretchable electronics have
    been

    explored that can serve as pivotal components in wearable sensors.

    3.

    Sensor Types: This section covers an in-depth analysis of diverse sensors—from
    colori-

    metric, chem-optical, and electrochemical, to transistors and chemiresistors.
    Emphasis

    is laid on the critical role these sensors play in monitoring environmental gaseous
    pol-

    lutants, including but not limited to ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous
    oxide

    (N2O), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, H2S, sulfur dioxide
    (SO2),

    ozone (O3), hydrocarbons (CxHy), and hydrogen fluoride (HF). The significance
    of

    deploying proficient detection methods for these pollutants is accentuated.

    Challenges in Gas Sensor Optimization: Distinct from existing literature, this
    section

    offers a meticulous discussion on challenges that have remained largely unexplored.

    Topics such as circuit integration, real-time sensing, repeatability, power consumption,

    gas-sensitive material deposition, and stability, among others, are examined in
    detail.

    The uniqueness of this review paper lies in its holistic approach, addressing
    numerous

    facets of gas sensor technology in a singular, comprehensive document. We envision
    that

    this will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt researchers and industry experts, steering them
    towards

    pioneering the next generation of gas sensors. In the following sections, various
    materials,

    device architectures, and sensing approaches are reviewed and are discussed and
    presented

    with regard to gas-sensing parameters that mainly include sensor response, sensitivity,

    response/recovery times, selectivity, detection limit, and stability.

    2. Sensing Materials

    Various sensing materials, including 2D nanostructures, carbon nanomaterials,
    CPs,

    nanohybrids, and MOSs, have been reported to allow a reliable detection system
    for the

    advanced monitoring of gaseous pollutants. These are discussed in the following
    sections.

    2.1. 2D Nanostructures

    The latest developments in the use of two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures for
    sensors

    for monitoring gaseous pollutants are discussed in this section. These 2D nanostructures

    have gained broad interest owing to their superior electronic and material properties
    and

    high photo-response. Numerous studies have shown the exceptional physical/chemical

    properties of 2D nanostructures and their wide range of applications in healthcare,
    defence,

    environmental monitoring, and food safety. These 2D nanostructures, such as graphene,

    graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), poly-types of transition-metal dichalcogenides
    (TMDC

    or TMD) materials (for example, MoS2 and WS2), and oxides of group B elements
    such as

    MoO3, WO3, and MnO2, can have exceptional electrical, chemical, physical, and
    optical

    properties, with high electrical conductivity, electron mobility, and a large
    surface area.

    These are attributes that are highly beneﬁcial in sensing applications [20], allowing
    the

    use of these materials in photoelectrochemical, ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET),
    ﬂuorescence,

    surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetric biosensors [21].

    Graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M, transi-

    tion metal; X, chalcogen atom), have dominated the spotlight. For instance, the
    application

    of 2D titanium carbide MXenes for detecting various gases pollutants is proposed
    by Si-

    monenko et al. to take advantage of lowering response and recovery times, increasing

    sensitivity and stability, and improving sensitive functionality in humid atmospheres
    [22].

    The latest advancements in device integration, microfabrication, and material
    and de-

    vice processing make it possible to integrate materials such as Ti3C2Tx MXene-loaded

    3D-substrates into lab-on-a-chip systems, which can analyze multiple analytes
    in the gas

    form [23]. Additionally, layered 2D nanomaterials, so-called layered metal disulﬁdes

    (LMDs) such as SnSe2, an anisotropic binary layered material with a hexagonal
    structure,

    have been used in the gassensing ﬁeld as they offer unique electronic characteristics,
    high

    sensitivity, rapid response, good selectivity, and low operating temperature.
    Chemiresistive

    SnSe2 sensors have demonstrated a signiﬁcant response of 60% to 1 ppm NO2 at room

    temperature (RT) [24]. Despite these attributions that make them an ideal candidate
    for

    wearable gas sensors compared to ZnO, their performance is limited in harsh environmental

    conditions [25–27].

    2.2. Carbon Nanomaterials

    Developing sensitive nanomaterials with a rapid response to detect and quantify

    low concentrations of gaseous pollutants is a big challenge. Carbon nanomaterials
    have

    shown great potential to be efﬁcient sensing materials due to their exceptional
    character-

    istics like great sensitivity, high solid–gas interactions, and a superior surface-to-volume

    ratio [28]. Optimizing key factors such as the physical structure and surface
    architec-

    ture of the deposited carbon nanomaterials on the electrodes/substrates (e.g.,
    porosity,

    thickness, and interface properties) should be deeply considered to achieve the
    best de-

    vice performance [29]. On the other hand, two other key factors affect the sensitivity
    of

    carbon nanomaterial-based gas sensors: surface area and electrical conductivity.
    These

    factors can be improved through the chemical modiﬁcation of the surface (e.g.,
    surface

    functionalization with other nanoparticles, metal atoms, polymers, ionic liquids,
    enzymes,

    etc.) [28]. Carbon-based nanomaterials are generally classiﬁed based on their
    geometric

    structures into three types of fullerenes (spheres as in C60 (soccer ball) or
    ellipsoids as

    in C70 (rugby ball)), carbon nanotubes (CNTs, tube-shaped), and graphene (single
    sheets

    of carbon atoms) [30]. Gas sensors using such materials and their derivatives
    have been

    widely demonstrated [31].

    2.2.1. Fullerenes

    With 60 π-electrons in their structure and high electron mobility, fullerenes
    have earned

    prominent notice in sensing applications due to their exceptional charge transport
    and

    separation, unique photophysical properties, and high electrical conductivity.
    They tend to

    improve polymeric sensors’ overall sensitivity and sensing performance for health
    care and

    environment monitoring [32]. Particularly in the gas-sensing area, the curvature
    effects of

    C60 make it a top candidate for the physical adsorption of small molecules such
    as CO2 via

    van der Waals interactions [33].

    Some approaches have been veriﬁed to improve fullerenes’ surface reactivity and

    adsorption capacity. In a recent study, boron-functionalized C60 fullerene decorated
    with

    Sc was studied to adsorb CO2 efﬁciently. The boron atoms chemically doped with
    C60

    (C48B12) make it a powerful electron acceptor to bond strongly with Sc atoms.
    The large

    energy barrier provided by this metal-incorporated system prevents aggregation
    even at

    critically high temperatures. Moreover, Sc atoms, the lightest transition metal
    atoms, offer a

    larger capacity for reversible CO2 adsorption at ambient temperature in the ﬁnal
    form of Sc-

    decorated C48B12 due to polarization and charge transfer effects. Each decorated
    Sc atom

    is capable of capturing four CO2 molecules resulting in a 52% of gravimetric density.
    This

    system can also be employed efﬁciently to separate CO2 from its mixtures with
    N2, H2, and

    CH4 [33]. In the case of chemiresistive gas sensing, providing a chemically heterogeneous

    nanocomposite can affect the hole density of the fullerenes and, consequently,
    increase

    the gas adsorption. In another study, a chemiresistive sensing composite of brominated

    fullerene and single-walled carbon nanotubes (C60Br24/SWCNT) was proposed [34].
    While

    SWCNTs bring about a conductive composite, Br atoms make it capable of bonding
    with

    H atoms of gas molecules through medium-strength halogen bonds. Different SWCNTs

    loadings (2, 5, 8, and 10 wt%) were tested. Based on results and DFT calculations,
    the

    best sensing performance was demonstrated by halogenated C60 composites mixed
    with

    SWCNT (10 wt%) compared to pristine fullerene composites (Figure 1). At RT, a
    trace

    amount (50 ppb) of H2S was selectively detected in the presence of CO or NO with
    a superb

    response of 1.75% [34].

    2.2.2. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)

    CNTs, a family of 1D nanomaterials, have been widely used in gas-sensing applications

    due to their hollow core, high electrical conductivity, chemical inertness, and
    high surface

    area. CNTs perform like p-type semiconductors since oxidation states and defects
    are

    formed in their synthesis and puriﬁcation steps. However, they have sites with
    a few defects

    in their nanoscale architecture, which can be a drawback [35]. The interactions
    between

    CNTs and the target gas are either van der Waals or donor–acceptor. Gas-adsorption-

    induced charge transfer has been veriﬁed as the primary sensing mechanism for
    CNT-based

    gas sensors. As CNTs bridge the sensor electrodes, each CNT performs as a conductive

    channel, capable of adsorbing the gas species. Different approaches have been
    described to

    form these CNT channels, including single CNT bridging, dielectrophoretic (DEP)
    assembly,

    and dispersed CNT network formation [36]. SWCNTs have been used in ultra-sensitive

    FETs to monitor ppm to ppb amounts of gases due to their capability to be applied
    in

    miniaturized devices under low temperatures. A remarkable device response of 10
    ppm

    to 100 ppb was achieved for detecting NO2 gas using a SWCNT-FET platform (Figure
    2).

    This superior low limit of detection (LOD) is due to the increase in the Schottky
    barrier

    modulation generated by the smart conﬁguration of the sensor in which an individual

    semiconducting SWCNT is directly connected between the interdigitated source and
    drain

    electrodes. As it is the ﬁrst and most sensitive unfunctionalized carbon-nanomaterial-

    based gas sensor operating at RT, it can offer valuable knowledge for constructing
    the next

    generation of CNT-based gas sensors [37].

    Semiconducting CNTs have also been decorated with tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles

    via a two-step dielectrophoretic assembly, ﬁrst to form CNT channels between the
    comb-

    shaped electrodes, and then to attach SnO2 nanoparticles onto the CNT surfaces.
    This

    sensor could successfully detect trace amounts of NO2 gas (10 ppb) due to the
    p-n hetero-

    junctions between the CNTs and the SnO2 nanoparticles, which caused a sharp increase
    in

    the resistance [38].

    A sol–gel-based composite ﬁlm of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in an

    alumina (Al2O3) matrix has revealed a high gas-sensing response (7.3%) to CO2
    concen-

    trations from 450 ppm to 50 ppm. The change in resistance was considered an indicator

    for the gas measurements. Due to the charge transfer mechanism between MWCNTs
    and

    gas molecules, a considerable increase occurred in the resistance level upon CO2
    exposure.

    Furthermore, UV light and heat were applied as different recovery modes, resulting
    in

    fast desorption times of CO2. This fast-response (~50 s) and stable sensor can
    be used

    in multiple gas-analyte-sensing applications as an economical and reliable method
    [39].

    As another example of the application of functionalized SnO2/CNT-based gas-sensing

    materials, a highly sensitive copper-nanoparticle-coated SnO2/CNT composite ﬁlm
    was

    used to detect H2S at RT. While CNTs are applied to transmit charge, the p-CuO/n-SnO2

    interface causes a high resistance in the sensing materials by creating a charge-carrier

    depletion layer. Selectivity of the sensor in 40 ppm H2S with a faster maximum
    response

    of 19% was veriﬁed in the presence of the same gas amount of NH3 (4.1%), CO (0.2%),

    and SO2 (0.1%). In the presence of different concentrations of H2S, the sensor
    showed

    stable performance, outstanding repeatability, and a considerable decrease in
    resistivity.

    The sensor also revealed a fast response of 4 min for low concentrations of H2S
    (10 ppm)

    with a sensitivity of 4.41 and a recovery time of 10 min [40]. Combining single-
    (75%)

    and multi- (25%) walled CNTs has recently been employed to detect NH3 and NO2
    using

    impedance spectroscopy. Functionalizing these CNTs with pyrene led to a more sensitive

    ﬁlm to both gases than the bare forms. Sensing layers reveal different impedance
    responses

    upon exposure to different gases. In addition, since a wide range of frequencies
    is required

    for analyzing the signal responses of the ﬁlms to the gases, it is possible not
    only to identify

    but also quantify the concentration levels of the gases [41].

    2.2.3. Graphene

    Various production methods have been reported for graphene-based gas sensors over

    the last few years owing to graphene’s beneﬁts, including superb optical transparency,

    conductivity, mechanical strength, fast charge transfer, and low surface area.
    However,

    the lack of defective sites in pure graphene and its reduced surface area due
    to simple

    aggregation may limit the recovery speed of the sensor and its stability in humid
    condi-

    tions. Thus, to achieve the next generation of commercialized graphene-based gas
    sensors,

    different ways of optimizing the use of graphene should be investigated. Graphene
    is

    considered the basic structure for other carbon nanomaterials, which can be stacked
    up

    to form graphite, wrapped up to produce fullerenes, and rolled to shape nanotubes
    [42].

    Surface modiﬁcation techniques have effectively enhanced the gas-sensing properties
    of

    graphene. In addition, FETs have also been proven to be valuable platforms for
    fabricating

    ultra-sensitive graphene-based gas sensors [43].

    Hydrophobic polymer brush insertion was applied to graphene FETs as a surface

    treatment to rapidly detect gaseous pollutants of NO2, NH3, and CO2 [44]. This
    ultrathin

    surface modiﬁcation layer boosted graphene-sensing performance for NO2 to 5.3
    times

    more with a LOD of 4.8 ppb by covering the charged impurities on the SiO2/Si substrates.

    C and Si atoms belong to the same group with similar chemical properties, with
    only

    a larger atomic radius for Si atoms than carbon. Thus, by doping Si atoms into
    the C

    network of graphene, the atomic arrangement becomes more crowded, which leads
    to the

    modiﬁcation of its chemical properties by changing the electronic structure of
    graphene.

    As the ideal performance of Si-doped graphene gas sensors for NO and NO2 was veriﬁed

    theoretically through ab initio DFT; experimental studies were also conducted
    to approve

    the whole concept. In another study, active sites of Si atoms were well-doped
    into the

    carbon network of graphene nanosheets in a high-temperature annealing process
    at 400 ◦C

    between graphene oxide (GO) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) [45]. The prepared sensing

    material revealed unique selectivity and sensitivity to NOx with a response value
    of 21.5%

    (50 ppm NO2) and response and recovery time of 126 s and 378 s, respectively.
    In addition,

    these chemiresistive sensors allowed the detection of a wide NO2 gas concentration
    range

    from 300 ppm to 18 ppb [45]. Graphene has also been employed as the source electrode
    in

    fabricating a vertical graphene ﬁeld effect transistor (VGr-FET) for the gas-phase
    sensing of

    ammonia, isoprene, oxygen, and water vapor [46]. Thin layers of C60 as the semiconductor

    ﬁlm and Al as the drain electrode were coupled with graphene to make a graphene/C60/Al

    structure. Analyzing the I–V response curves of the heterojunction diode model,
    the

    energy barrier height between graphene and polycrystalline fullerene was determined.

    The lowest LOD of 86 ppb was achieved for NH3 compared to isoprene (420 ppb).
    This is

    due to the donor nature of the adsorbed NH3 on p-type graphene, which causes a
    positive

    gating effect in the VGr-FET. The authors recommended their facile economical
    sensor as a

    promising quick-response device for diagnostic applications in the early stages
    of severe

    lung cancer [46].

    2.3. Conductive Polymers

    Polymers are macromolecules with repeating structural units united by covalent

    connections. Although traditional aliphatic polymers are usually insulators, polymers
    can

    also be electrically conducting. The conjugated backbones of CPs are their primary
    building

    blocks. Due to the delocalization of electrons in a continuously π-overlapped
    orbital along

    the polymer backbone, CPs, which are also referred to as conjugated polymers,
    possess

    some of the most interesting electrical and optical properties. These properties
    are a result

    of the polymer backbone [47]. As a result of their outstanding chemical and environmental

    stability, biocompatibility, and unique optical and electrical properties, CPs
    have attracted

    considerable attention in a wide range of scientiﬁc domains, such as chemistry,
    biology,

    electronics, and materials science [48].

    The attractive and distinctive optoelectronic features of CPs allow them to be
    ex-

    ploited for numerous applications, including gas detection. Flexible gas sensors
    that are

    constructed out of CP-sensing materials have drawn a lot of attention due to their
    many

    advantageous properties. These properties include RT operation, tunable conductivity,

    ﬂexibility, environmental stability, low cost, and various functionalization options
    [49]. A

    conjugated arrangement with alternating single and double bonds, or a conjugated
    system

    linked with atoms which generate orbitals for a continuing orbital overlap, appears
    to be an

    essential requirement for a polymer to conduct inherently. For polymers to be
    electronically

    conducting, charge carriers and the orbital system that enables these carriers
    to move freely

    are necessary, similar to the free electron movement associated with high conductivity
    in

    metals [50]. Since the 1980s, CPs that are solution-processable aromatic polymers
    such

    as poly(p-phenylene) (PPP), polypyrrole (Ppy), polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene
    (PT),

    poly(3,4-ethyelenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their derivatives have been utilized
    as ac-

    tive layers [51]. There are several ways to modify CP conductivity to achieve
    desired results.

    Doping modiﬁes a polymer’s structure chemically. Alternatively, CPs can be mixed
    with ad-

    ditives, including metals, semiconductors, acids, or surfactants. In a study,
    an NH3-sensing

    composite was prepared by coating polymer sulfonic-acid-doped PANI with bacterial
    cel-

    lulose (BC) nanoﬁbers and co-doped with dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and
    poly

    (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS) [52]. BC/PANI-DBSA/PAMPS

    was successfully synthesized using an in situ chemical oxidation polymerization
    technique.

    This synthesis method produced a profound structure of a nanoscale PANI layer
    connected

    to the BC backbone, as shown in Figure 3a. The homogenously coated three-dimensional

    network structure enabled faster gas adsorption/desorption and electrical signaling.

    Furthermore, a macromolecular sulfonic acid, PAMPS, made closer connections be-

    tween the crystal islands because of various interactions. Additionally, more
    sensing sites

    were created on the surface of the PANI, which enhanced the structural stability
    of the

    DBSA doping and strengthened the conduction signaling of the material. The produced

    chemiresistive sensor based on this macroscopic ﬁlm had a simple device conﬁguration.

    It displayed a sensing response (deﬁned as the ratio of the device’s intrinsic
    resistance

    to that in the presence of the target gas) of 6.1 up to 100 ppm, high selectivity,
    and rapid

    response/recovery time of 10.2 s/8.6 s for 100 ppm with a LOD of 200 ppb to NH3
    at RT.

    This easy and versatile method for building sensing materials on nanoﬁber templates
    has

    potential in NH3-exposed areas.

    The effectiveness of a nanohybrid sensor based on PANI, silver oxide (Ag2O), and

    GO (PANI-Ag2O-GO) was evaluated for NO2 sensing [53]. The dispersed graphene and

    PANI/Ag2O solutions in deionized water were combined to make the composite sensor.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    11 of 73

    The resulting solution was then dropped and dried over platinum microelectrodes
    attached

    to alumina ceramic chips. A computerized characterization instrument was used
    to deter-

    mine the sensor’s capabilities (Figure 3b–d). A data-collecting system recorded
    the readings

    after introducing the target gas to the sensor via the gas cylinder. When subjected
    to 25 ppm

    NO2 at 100 ◦C, the results showed that the PANI-Ag2O-GO sensor (5.85) had a two-fold

    higher response than the PANI (2.5) and PANI-Ag2O (3.25) sensors. The charge transfers

    between the adsorbed NO2 gas molecules and the nanohybrid surface were attributed
    to

    the increased gas-sensing response of the nanohybrid sensor (PANI-Ag2O-GO). On
    the

    surface of PANI-Ag2O-GO, the adsorbed NO2 molecules decomposed into nitric oxide

    (NO) or dinitrogen oxide (N2O). The formation of a π–π conjugation system between
    PANI

    and Ag2O/GO aided the dissociation of NO2 molecules, resulting in a large electronic

    cloud and excellent electron transport channel. As a result, the proposed sensor
    can be

    used to detect NO2 gas at low temperatures [53].

    A capacitive-type nanohybrid sensor for detecting CO2 gas was investigated and

    constructed using Ppy and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) [54]. Initially, Ppy was
    made

    from its monomer using a single-step reaction of chemical oxidative polymerization.
    This

    reaction was carried out in hydrochloric acid (HCl) and used ammonium persulfate
    (APS).

    Then, an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization process produced the nanohybrid

    (Ppy-CuPc) at a temperature between 0–5 ◦C with or without the inclusion of a
    cationic

    surfactant called cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). Incorporating CTAB
    into

    the Ppy-CuPc mixture led to an interconnected network of nanoﬁbers resulting in
    higher

    response and sensitivity than Ppy-CuPc nanohybrids and Ppy. The CTAB-based enhanced

    sensing performance of Ppy-CuPc nanohybrids was attributed to the porous structure
    of

    the sensing layer facilitating the diffusion of gas molecules, the high surface-to-volume
    ratio

    of the nano-ﬁbrous structure of Ppy, the highly interconnected network of Ppy
    nanoﬁbers,

    and the synergistic effects of the properties of individual components of Ppy
    and CuPc [54].

    Another example is a Ppy-modiﬁed TiO2 deposited on Cu-interdigitated electrodes

    that was exploited as a chemiresistive CO gas sensor with high sensitivity and
    rapid

    response even at ambient temperature. Ppy/TiO2 was directly synthesized via an
    in

    situ chemical polymerization. The CO response measurements were carried out on
    active

    Ppy/TiO2 ﬁlms by exposing them to CO gas of 1–320 ppm at RT. The sensor’s demonstrated

    response and recovery times were fast (36 and 38 s, respectively) and dependent
    on the

    ﬁlm composition [55].

    2.4. Nanohybrids

    Detection of low traces of harmful toxic gases using nanohybrid sensors is increasing

    due to their low cost, feasibility, low maintenance, simple structures, and capability
    to

    sense various types of gases [56]. The conjugation of organic and inorganic nanomaterials

    has introduced a new class of hybrid nanomaterials [57]. In contrast to single-component

    nanomaterials, nanohybrids offer versatile chemical and physical functionalities
    that are

    advantageous in various ﬁelds [58]. Nanohybrid sensors beneﬁt from increased conductiv-

    ity, porosity, catalytic activity, and optical and electrical potential, with
    a low LOD for gases

    even at ppm concentrations [57–59].

    Semiconductor-based gas sensors such as ZnO, SnO2, NiO, and CuO have attracted

    signiﬁcant attention owing to their good sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and
    capability to

    detect a wide range of toxic gases. However, semiconductor-based gas sensors suffer

    from low selectivity, surface defects, weak adsorption potential, and low anti-corrosive

    properties [60]. Nanohybrid-based sensors offer a new paradigm to attain selectivity
    with

    enhanced sensitivity. Polymers such as PT, polyacetylene (PA), PEDOT, poly (phenylene

    vinylene) (PPV), PANI, and Ppy are among the CPs with potential use in gas sensing
    as

    their conductivity changes upon exposure to gas molecules [61]. Utilizing such
    polymers

    has the beneﬁts of high functionality, low cost, excellent stability, rapid response
    time,

    remarkable recovery, facile synthesis, and high surface area. However, poor sensitivity,

    selectivity, response, and recovery restrict their gas-sensing capabilities. Incorporating

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    12 of 73

    semiconductors and inorganic nanomaterials in polymer-based nanohybrid sensors,
    such

    as metal oxides and metal oxide semiconductors, enhances their sensitivity, stability,
    and

    response by increasing the surface area and allowing the detection of a wide range
    of

    gases [62,63]. Generally, immiscible polymers are without speciﬁc interactions;
    therefore,

    developing miscible composite polymers is of great concern. For instance, polymeric

    hybrids may possess weak bonding interactions like hydrogen bonds and van der
    Waals

    forces between organic and inorganic parts.

    In contrast, few organic/inorganic hybrids contain strong chemical bonds at the

    interface. These interactions depend on nanoparticle size, dispersion form, shape,
    and

    size distribution. To synthesize polymeric/inorganic nanohybrids sensors for detecting

    harmful gases such as hydrogen (H2), NH3, H2S, CO2, CO, NO2, and liqueﬁed petroleum

    gas (LPG), different methods such as physical, chemical, and electrochemical techniques

    have been used [64–66].

    2.5. Metal Oxide Semiconductors

    MOS materials have been extensively used in gas sensing due to their simple struc-

    ture, simple and established manufacturing process, compatibility with microelectronics

    manufacturing, low-cost, excellent response, and long-term stability [67]. As
    a result, MOS

    materials and their use in gas sensing have been extensively studied over several
    decades.

    The use of metal oxide gas sensors goes back to 1962, and it was realised that
    the resistance

    of such ﬁlms changes in the presence of CO2, toluene, and propane gases at a speciﬁc

    temperature [68]. This chemiresistive characteristic of semiconductor materials
    has made

    them ideal candidates for gas sensing. Initially, MOS gas sensors suffered from
    high power

    consumption and complicated fabrication processes, which hindered their application.

    However, in 1986, gas sensors based on SnO2 were commercialized [69,70].

    The adsorption/desorption of gas molecules onto the surface of semiconductor-based

    sensors leads to changes in electrical parameters, which determine the presence
    of analyte

    molecules in the environment. Subsequently, the analyte’s composition and chemical

    structure and the semiconductor materials’ morphology signiﬁcantly impact the
    operation

    of chemical gas sensors. Therefore, the right sensing material choice is critical
    in detecting

    gaseous compounds in the environment [71–74]. The use of MOSs to detect SO2 gas

    in wearable sensors is increasing. MOSs such as ZnO, SnO2, and In2O3 are relatively

    inexpensive, highly sensitive, and easy to fabricate [75]. Nanostructured ZnO-based
    MOS

    gas sensors, representative of n-type semiconductors, offer certain advantages
    including

    non-toxicity, cost-efﬁciency, rapid response, and stability. These attributes
    make them

    notable candidates in the realm of gas sensing, especially for wearable devices.
    The 1D

    ZnO nanostructure-based sensors have demonstrated the ability to detect gases
    like NO2,

    NH3, CH4, H2, and C3H8, though the sensitivity largely depends on speciﬁc operating

    temperatures [76,77]. However, it is crucial to highlight that the choice of the
    best material

    is inﬂuenced by application-speciﬁc requirements. Comparing the performance of
    ZnO

    with other metal oxide materials under standardized conditions would be imperative
    for

    a comprehensive analysis. In addition to ZnO-based 1D nanomaterials, advancements

    in gas sensing also focus on other one-dimensional semiconductors, such as Pd-doped

    1D tungsten oxide nanowires [78]. Overall, metal oxide nanowires have been gaining

    attention for their stable chemical properties and considerable surface-to-volume
    ratio.

    By increasing the surface area, these studies have shown enhanced adsorption of
    analyte

    molecules, subsequently improving the gas-sensing response of the device. For
    a holistic

    understanding, it is essential to consider parameters like sensor temperature
    and gas

    concentration when evaluating the magnitude of the response.

    Moreover, it has been realized that the electrical properties of chemiresistive
    structures

    are highly affected by the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules when the
    size of the

    sensing material is proportional to its Debye length. Additionally, recent advancements

    in the ﬁeld of two-dimensional nanomaterials such as metal–organic frameworks
    (MOFs),

    graphene, and TMDs, with a thickness of a few atomic layers to tens of nanometers,
    due

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    13 of 73

    to unique physical (large surface area), chemical, and electronic properties,
    have made

    them suitable structures for the development of functional devices [79–81]. As
    reviewed

    elsewhere, MOSs (e.g., CuO, ZnO, TiO2, SnO2, In2O3, etc.) have also been exploited

    as a sensing interface in surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based detection of gases
    such as

    NOx, NH3, and H2S [82]. However, nanostructured n-type TiO2 has gained extensive

    interest because of its exceptional advantages of nontoxicity, wide bandgap (~3.1
    eV), cost-

    effectiveness, and high chemical stability, attributions that are pivotal in gas
    sensing [83,84].

    3. Wearable Substrates and Conducting Electrodes

    There has been a lot of interest in ﬂexible sensors due to their potential application

    in wearable chemical-sensing applications [85], especially in the disciplines
    of sports [86],

    health [87], medicine, and workplace safety [88]. Real-time monitoring of the
    body’s

    condition and surrounding environment enables a rapid response during an accident
    [89].

    Since they may signiﬁcantly affect people’s well-being, the gases produced as
    a byproduct

    of natural and industrial processes must be identiﬁed and monitored. A vital requirement

    for the practical use of wearable sensors is determining which substrate best
    matches the

    requisite wearable and ﬂexible features. Therefore, numerous attempts have been
    made to

    design smart, ﬂexible substrates for wearable applications. So far, different
    PB, polymeric,

    textile, and stretchable electronic substrates have been proposed for wearable
    sensing

    platforms. However, their characteristics should be carefully examined before
    choosing

    one for a speciﬁc application, as each offers different electrical and mechanical
    properties

    and production costs. At the same time, their processability can also be an issue
    [90].

    3.1. Paper-Based (PB)

    A PB substrate can also be employed as a starting substrate for manufacturing
    ﬂexible

    and wearable gas sensors. Paper is becoming more popular in electronic devices
    as a ﬂexible,

    low-cost, lightweight, tailorable, environmentally friendly, degradable, and renewable

    material. Since they degrade quickly, they can reduce the quantity of electronic
    garbage

    created for future generations. In recent years, numerous PB sensors have been
    described

    for wearable applications. PB gas, humidity, and strain sensors are among the
    most widely

    researched PB sensors. In general, electrodes are required for PB sensors. When
    compared

    to other substrates, PB substrates have an increased surface roughness and the
    existence

    of holes, both of which prevent them from being compatible with high-quality thin
    ﬁlm

    deposition and transfer. Compared to other substrates, PB electrodes may be made
    using

    several processes, including printing, magnetron sputtering, conductive tape pasting,
    and

    pencil drawing [90]. Electrode production techniques such as printing, and magnetron

    sputtering can be applied on various substrates. Simple, low-cost, solvent-free
    processing

    methods such as pencil drawing and conductive tape pasting, which take advantage
    of the

    rough surface of the paper, can be used to make the electrodes of PB sensors.
    The sensing

    materials employed to construct PB gas sensors include carbon compounds and derivatives,

    MOS, and organic materials. Among these sensing materials, carbon compounds and
    their

    derivatives are particularly helpful. Because paper is not resistant to heat,
    traditional MOS

    gas-sensing materials that perform well at high temperatures are challenging.
    Furthermore,

    PB substrates are unsuitable for detecting VOCs due to their high hygroscopicity.
    This

    is because absorbed humidity affects conductivity more than the presence of the
    target

    VOCs [91]. PB moisture sensors have been demonstrated for tracking respiration
    rates and

    patterns [92]. These sensors are based on the propensity of paper to absorb moisture
    from

    its surroundings. Gas sensing has a wide range of applications, and it would be
    simple to

    print and attach a sensor like this to a human body.

    Write printing is a method of printing that involves applying a solution of functional

    components to a surface with pens or other writing implements. When expelled from

    the nozzle tip, functional ink for write printing must harden fast. Printed ink
    should

    meet electrical, mechanical, and thermal standards to produce high-performance
    wearable

    sensors. For example, write printing technology has created PB wearable gas sensors
    of

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    14 of 73

    nearly “zero cost” [90]. These PB wearable gas sensors can achieve sufﬁcient precision,

    ecological sustainability, and durable operation under high relative humidity
    (RH) settings

    due to appropriate printing materials and structural design.

    A simple, low-cost, light hydrocarbon gas sensor has also been proposed based
    on bending

    a PB cantilever generated by polymer swelling [93]. A smartphone camera was employed
    for

    data reading. The functional layer of the sensory cantilever was made of polyethylene
    film, the

    adhesive layer of the sensory cantilever was made of double-sided sticky tape,
    and the substrate

    of the sensory cantilever was made of weighing paper. The hydrocarbons used to
    investigate the

    sensor’s performance were Xylene, n-hexane, benzene, ethylbenzene, and toluene
    (BTEX). The

    sensor demonstrated an excellent linear response to hydrocarbon content and a
    wide detection

    range, low detection, and rapid response performance.

    3.2. Polymer-Based Sensors

    Polymeric materials have gained popularity in sensing applications due to their

    processibility, durability, and low cost [57]. A recent study on polymeric sensors
    focuses on

    a nanocomposite of polypyrrole and TiO2 to detect volatile gas analytes such as
    ammonia,

    acetone, and ethanol. The distinguishing characteristic of this nanocomposite
    is that it is

    wrapped in poly-methyl methacrylate. Synthesis of polypyrrole was achieved through

    chemical oxidative polymerization of the pyrrole monomer. Gaseous analytes were
    detected

    with TiO2 nanoparticles in the composite structure. TiO2 is advantageous as it
    can endure

    temperatures as high as 600 ◦C, is abundant, has good stability, and is easy to
    process [94].

    After the individual components of the composite material were prepared, the ternary

    nanocomposite was designed through physical methods such as grinding and mixing.
    The

    stoichiometric ratio of TiO2 to polypyrrole was taken as [1:1]. This ratio is
    critical as it helps

    obtain a composite of strong adsorption after 30 min of manual grinding. The gas-sensing

    performance of the nanocomposite was assessed with three different gases, as mentioned

    previously. The composite material was subjected to an air atmosphere to simulate
    real

    application conditions. The resulting composite material shows the highest sensitivity

    to NH3. Although this study does not propose a wearable solution for gas-monitoring

    technologies as it is a ﬁber-optic sensor, it is nevertheless easy and fast to
    fabricate, and it is

    a promising technology and approach for future wearable sensor technologies [94].

    A wearable chemiresistive CP-based NH3 sensor was developed by constructing

    porous and neural-network-like electrospun ﬁlms [95]. The intriguing characteristic
    of

    this sensor is that Au/Ppy was employed. The structure of the developed material
    (3D

    interconnections), the porous structure, and the synergistic effects between Au
    and Ppy

    nanoparticles make a sensitive sensor for NH3 detection and monitoring. The neural-

    network-like structure of the composite provides a practical pathway for signal
    transferring

    throughout the ﬁlm, resulting in the effective transfer of electric signals from
    NH3-Ppy

    active sites to the working electrodes. The porous and hollow capsule-like structure
    is the

    key to fast and responsive detection of NH3. This structure allows for fast doping
    and

    re-doping between NH3 and Ppy capsules. This is especially important for detecting
    NH3

    in the atmosphere quickly and effectively. Furthermore, the synergistic effects
    between Ppy

    and Au nanoparticles are essential for the number of active sites for NH3 to bind
    and to

    be detected by the sensor. This unique system promises a great future in wearable
    sensor

    technology applications due to its enhanced mechanical and electronic properties
    [95].

    Another area of polymeric material research focused on fabricating cellulose acetate

    (CA)-based nanoﬁbers and nanoﬁlms [96]. The study aimed to detect H2S, which is
    crucial

    as it leads to respiratory problems [97]. The study’s novelty was using an environmentally

    friendly CA and an ionic liquid (glycerol) to facilitate charge transfer within
    the composite

    matrix. Ppy, a CP, and tungsten oxide (WO3) doping achieved the sensor’s conducting

    properties. Chemiresistive sensing nanoﬁlms were prepared by solution casting,
    whereas

    nanoﬁbers were prepared by electrospinning. The ﬁnal sensor was fabricated and
    assem-

    bled by placing ﬁlms/ﬁbers between two plates of copper (bottom) and stainless
    steel (top).

    Stainless steel was chosen as the top contact as it is resistant to the corrosive
    effect of H2S.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    15 of 73

    Heatprooﬁng of the sensor was accomplished by using a conductive silver paste
    covering

    all the layers. Assessment of the H2S sensing capabilities of the sensor was carried
    out

    with a mass ﬂowmeter, subjecting the sensor to H2S ﬂows at a ﬁxed rate and different

    concentrations (1–50 ppm). In addition, the sensor’s performance was tested under
    varying

    temperature conditions. This allows the testing of the sensor under different
    weather

    conditions. Test results revealed that nanoﬁlm and nanoﬁber sensors could operate
    above

    20 ◦C and have a minimum LOD of 1 ppm. In addition, the sensors showed a fast
    response

    time, nearly half a minute, with a quicker response time of 22.8 s. The sensors’
    distinctive

    reproducibility properties, long-term stability, and low humidity dependence make
    them

    great candidates for application in outdoor and indoor atmospheres [96].

    A selective sensor for NO2 detection was developed with a triazine-based 2D or-

    ganic polymer [98]. A covalent triazine framework (CTF) was designed with a nanoscale

    thickness and intrinsic and periodic pore structures. In addition, this material
    possesses

    abundant functional groups, aiding the detection process. The outstanding property
    of this

    design is the ultrahigh sensitivity to NO2 in the atmosphere. The results showed
    that the

    response time of the material is between 35–47 s, and sensitivity to NO2 is at
    452.6 ppm−1.

    Assessment of the gas-sensing performance of this triazine-based 2D organic polymer

    (T-2DP) was carried out together with a sensitivity assessment. Before the tests,
    T-2DP

    sheets were assembled into a thin ﬁlm to act as the chemiresistive gas sensor.
    Various

    targets were used in these tests, including inorganics and organics. Some inorganic
    targets

    were NO2, NH3, and SO2, and the organic ones include methanol, ethanol, and acetone.
    It

    is crucial to mention that the detection and monitoring tests were carried out
    at RT. Sensing

    performance was evaluated using the variations in relative conductance of the
    material

    before and after exposure to the target gas. The highest response was observed
    for NO2,

    with a response of 505% [98].

    On the other hand, the material showed extremely low sensitivity to H2S (9.8%).
    In

    addition to sensitivity testing, response time was also tested, and similar results
    were ob-

    tained, strengthening the basis for NO2 detection. Response time was dependent
    on the gas

    concentration, and, upon NO2 exposure, response time was measured as 47 s for
    150 ppb

    and 35 s for 5 ppb. Tests also revealed that the sensing behavior of T-2DP is
    reversible

    and reproducible. Even after 15 cycles, only a 4% variation in detection performance
    was

    observed during exposure to 1 ppm NO2. Finally, the mechanical durability of the
    sensor

    was tested by performing a bending test. The sensor was bent for multiple cycles
    with an

    angle of 45◦. The 2D nanosheets provide inherent ﬂexibility to the material; thus,
    the sensor

    displayed continuous constant conductance during bending. As a result, NO2 detection

    was observed to be stable for 500 cycles with only a 2.5% degradation after 1000
    complete

    cycles. Overall, T-2DP was proven to be an excellent selective sensor for NO2
    due to its

    reproducibility, durability, and sensitivity, making it a promising solution for
    the wearable

    detection of atmospheric pollutants [98].

    3.3. Textiles

    Textiles are a suitable substrate for the realization of wearable gaseous pollutant
    sen-

    sors, as such an approach would render the integration of such sensors with clothing
    trivial.

    Several characteristics make textiles attractive. These include their durability,
    breathability,

    and washability. Due to their availability, silk and cotton are the most commonly
    preferred

    textile fabrics [99,100]. Cotton fabrics have gathered signiﬁcant attention due
    to their high

    ﬂexibility, low cost, high moisture absorption, strong mechanical strength, good
    biocom-

    patibility, and biodegradability. They can also be integrated into smart clothing
    [101].

    Furthermore, encapsulation is essential in wearable sensor technologies regarding
    atmo-

    spheric conditions. Encapsulation of electronic sensors ensures a waterproof coating
    and

    acts as a shielding layer for human skin [102].

    Graphene shows excellent performance in gas sensing; however, it also displays
    poor

    adhesion when used on textile materials. Research addressing this gap used amyloid

    nanoﬁbrils to fabricate graphene-based electronic textiles (e-textile) [103].
    Amyloid nanoﬁb-

    rils were used as a bio-inspired adhesive, promoting adhesion between the graphene
    ﬂakes

    and the cotton yarn. Graphene ﬂakes provide active sites for NO2 molecules to
    absorb,

    enabling the detection of pollutant gas in the environment. These interactions
    induce an

    increase in the electrical conductance of graphene. Figure 4a shows a schematic
    illustration

    of the fabrication process of different composite textile yarns.

    Response characteristics of the e-textile yarns were measured through exposure
    to a

    constant concentration of NO2 (100 ppm) over 15 min, and electrical current differences

    were plotted (∆I = I − I0). Among all textile composites examined, RGO/FBLG/CY

    had the best monitoring performance regarding NO2. In addition, the sensitivity
    of all

    materials was investigated by exposing them to NO2 between the concentration range

    of 0–100 ppm. The results show that, similarly to the results in monitoring performance,

    RGO/FBLG/CY achieved the highest sensitivity of 1 ppm, whereas the following best

    composite showed sensitivity between 3–5 ppm. RGO/FBLG/CY has the best performance

    among all ﬁve examined materials because amyloid nanoﬁbrils retained the best
    afﬁnity for

    GO ﬂakes, as the GO ﬂakes provided large binding sites for NO2 molecules. The
    selectivity

    tests were performed, and RGO/FBLG/CY showed a high response to NO2 and no reaction

    for N2, acetone, CO, CO2, NH3, and NO. The negative response to NH3 exposure can
    be

    attributed to the electron donor characteristics of NH3 on the rGO ﬂakes, which
    results in

    decreased electrical conductivity. Finally, the humidity test revealed that RGO/FBLG/CY

    does not exhibit any change in electrical conductivity under humidity.

    Consequently, RGO/FBLG/CY is a promising composite e-textile material for envi-

    ronmental gas monitoring with reliable performance. A schematic of the assembly
    and

    operation of the gas chamber is shown in Figure 4b, into which the e-textile gas
    sensor

    was embedded before NO2 exposure. Flow rate and concentration of NO2 were controlled

    through an MFC (Figure 4c). As shown in Figure 4d, the red LED light is not lit
    before NO2

    exposure while it is turned on after exposure to NO2 (10 ppm) for 4 min (Figure
    4e).

    As graphene shows signiﬁcant NO2-sensing characteristics, various study platforms

    exploited this material. Another textile application for NO2 detection was achieved
    by de-

    veloping a dopamine–graphene hybrid with highly conductive and ﬂexible properties
    [104].

    As previously discussed, graphene needs an adhesive agent to be used in textile
    applica-

    tions. In this study, dopamine was employed as the adhesive biomolecule. Dopamine’s

    adhesive properties come from the structure of catechol and amine groups. E-textile
    yarns

    were exposed to NO2 to test their feasibility in gas monitoring. Electrical current
    differ-

    ences (∆I) were plotted during the exposure (100 ppm). The plot shows that the
    electrical

    currents of DGY increased exponentially over time, whereas rGO-coated yarn displayed

    almost no increase. For both materials, saturation time was calculated, and DGY
    had a

    response time of ~1.5 min, whereas rGO-coated yarn had a 4 min response time.
    The

    materials’ sensitivity was characterized by exposing them to various concentrations
    of NO2

    ranging between 0–100 ppm and measuring their electrical conductivity. Although
    both

    materials display a linear increase, DGY showed greater sensitivity than the rGO-coated

    yarn, indicating the fabrication of a superior material regarding sensitivity
    to NO2. This is

    one of the key characteristics provided by dopamine, as rGO ﬂakes are attached
    more to

    DGY than rGO-coated yarn. The high sensitivity of DGY allows detection at levels
    as low

    as 0–10 ppm NO2. Reproducibility tests were also performed to assess the performance

    of the fabricated DGYs under repeated applications. Tests were conducted under
    10 ppm

    NO2 (exposure limit) and 2 min of exposure time, followed by 3 min of N2 gas.
    This cycle

    was repeated ﬁve times for both samples. These results conclude that DGY can be
    applied

    for wearable sensing applications, as it is reliable and durable. In addition,
    washability

    tests were conducted to conﬁrm DGY’s use for human applications. Like the reliability

    test, washability was tested in ﬁve cycles using soapy water. After ﬁve cycles
    of washing,

    DGYs did not display a signiﬁcant decrease in electrical conductivity (2.96% variation).

    Fabricated DGYs offer excellent durability, washability, and sensing characteristics,
    making

    them great candidates for wearable e-textiles for gaseous pollution monitoring
    systems.

    Regarding wearable textile sensors, colorimetric detection is also applied. Colorimetric

    detection provides easy and fast detection of gaseous pollutants in the environment.
    A

    study regarding colorimetric detection was conducted for the simultaneous detection
    of

    NH3 and HCl gases [105]. Combined detection of gaseous pollutants is essential
    and should

    be further investigated. There are also textile sensor applications for the dual
    detection

    of NO2 and NH3 in the literature. For instance, polyester textile was employed
    in the

    sensor. The sensor was graphene-based, and the detection of gases from human breath
    was

    aimed [106]. Overall, colorimetric detection of these gaseous pollutants is critical
    as they

    are colorless and spread quickly.

    3.4. Stretchable Electronics

    Standard electronics and microelectronics are primarily based on thick, rigid,
    and

    fragile substrates. For example, traditional printed circuit boards (PCBs) typically
    use

    ﬂame retardant (e.g., FR4) or other substrate materials. At the same time, bipolar
    junction

    transistor (BJT), bipolar complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (BiCMOS), and
    CMOS

    technologies are traditionally based on silicon wafers. Wearable applications
    necessitate

    a move away from these technologies and into devices and systems that are ﬂexible

    and ideally stretchable. The human body and skin are not ﬂat, rigid surfaces;
    they are

    in constant motion and soft, ﬂexible, and stretchable. The inconsistency between
    the

    mechanical properties of skin and electronic devices can lead to many issues;
    for example,

    the wearable device might get damaged due to the continuous motions and can fail
    or

    become detached from the skin or the wearer can also become injured from prolonged

    device use. Depending on the sensing modality, it can also lead to recording noise
    signals

    and motion artefacts. Other issues are related to the wearability and intrusiveness
    of the

    devices, which can create emotional stress for the wearer or a feeling of intrusiveness.

    In contrast, recorded data may be biased by the wearability factor, as the device
    itself

    may prohibit the wearer from performing daily tasks [107]. First-generation wearable
    de-

    vices have become widely available over the last ten years. However, these are
    rigid devices

    that are limited in functionality. It has, thus, become obvious, driven by current
    market

    and societal needs, that advanced next-generation technologies are needed to improve

    wearable devices’ wearability, form factor, un-intrusiveness, and ubiquity. Flexibility
    and

    stretchability are key factors in this direction. Technologies and devices can
    be divided

    into techniques and devices realized through standard clean-room-based microfabrication

    and additive manufacturing approaches. Microfabrication techniques (thin-ﬁlm deposition

    methods, photolithography, etc.) can lead to high-quality and performance devices
    with

    high resolution. However, they require high-cost, complex fabrication tools and
    facili-

    ties. Additive fabrication techniques (stencil screen, inkjet, extrusion-based
    printing, laser

    carbonization, etc.) are lower-cost simpler technologies, which, however, are
    limited in

    resolution [107–110]. Many devices have been demonstrated using such techniques,
    includ-

    ing strain/pressure sensors, interconnects, and electrodes. Hybrid technologies
    exploiting

    the advantages of each of these families of technologies but also in combination
    with stan-

    dard rigid technologies have emerged to address the challenges of wearable applications,

    particularly since the performance and level of integration of traditional microelectronics

    technologies cannot yet be rivalled. For example, the island-bridge approach can
    be used to

    allow some components and the electrical interconnects to be highly ﬂexible and
    stretchable

    and rigid components to sit on islands, thus allowing a hybrid implementation
    [110].

    As the substrates of on-body types of wearable gas sensors are in direct contact
    with

    the skin surface, they must be light, thin, ﬂexible, and, most importantly, breathable
    to

    avoid airﬂow blockage and inﬂammation resulting from sweating. A sufﬁcient stretchabil-

    ity provides appropriate stability to the sensor during movements. However, conventional

    ﬂexible substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyimide have low stretchabil-

    ity in the ﬂat ﬁlm form, so their suitability for epidermal electronics is low.
    Similarly, PB

    and textile substrates are unsuitable for manufacturing high-density circuits.
    They also

    cannot be used for the deposition of high-quality sensing materials. Therefore,
    designing

    advanced stretchable substrates with proper stability and durability becomes crucial
    in

    fabricating wearable sensing devices [111]. Various studies have reported the
    advance-

    ment of nanomaterial-based stretchable substrates and their application in stretchable

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    19 of 73

    electronics [112,113]. However, the major challenge lies in the ability of a device
    to be

    stretchable and, at the same time, allow electronic circuits and devices to retain
    electrical

    function and performance even under strain. Various unconventional materials have
    been

    used to construct functional device components and electronic circuits to overcome
    this

    issue. Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoﬂex (types of platinum-catalyzed
    silicones)

    are the two most common soft substrates used in the fabrication of stretchable
    electron-

    ics [114]. Other popular candidates as elastic substrates include poly(styrene-co-ethylene

    butylene-co-styrene) (SEBS)- and polyurethane (PU)-based elastomers [115]. A thin
    layer

    of soft PDMS and a strip of Ecoﬂex has also been tested to produce a stretchable,
    low-

    temperature, and ultrasensitive MoS2/rGO-based sensor for detecting NO2 at 10
    ppb. The

    nanocomposite was integrated directly into a conductive laser-induced graphene
    pattern to

    avoid using an interdigitated electrode. Due to the enhanced contact with the
    gas-sensing

    nanomaterials, these stretchable porous 3D patterns yielded exceptional selectivity
    and

    robust operation upon mechanical deformation. Moreover, the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite

    provides a controlled highly speciﬁc surface area and overcomes the drawbacks
    of pristine

    MoS2 in NO2 sensing, including low conductivity [116] (Figure 5).

    4. Sensor Types

    Conventional equipment to detect quantitatively, characterize, and classify differ-

    ent gases are based on gas chromatography (GC), mass spectrometry (MS), ion mobility

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    20 of 73

    spectrometry (IMS), pellistors, semiconductor gas sensors, or electrochemical
    devices [4].

    Although these methods of gas detection are stable and reliable, their use outside
    laborato-

    ries are limited due to their massive power consumption, cost, and size [117,118].
    As the

    demand for portable gas sensor devices with low power consumption and accurate
    sensing

    performance increases, alternative methods, such as the cantilever-based, capacitive-based,

    thermometric, optical, ﬁeld-effect transistor, solid-state electrochemical, and
    chemiresistive

    or colorimetric gas sensors, have gained a lot of attention [118].

    4.1. Colorimetric

    Colorimetric-based gas sensors can detect the presence of gaseous analytes and
    the

    concentration of the analytes through chemical reactions, resulting in color changes
    in the

    sensor [118]. The use of colorimetric gas sensors, such as thread-based washable
    textile

    gas sensors, is increasing due to their low power consumption and low LOD, low
    cost,

    selectivity, and multiplexity [119]. Additionally, the color changing of these
    sensors is easy

    to visualize and, hence, is intuitive, attributions that make them ideal for application
    in

    monitoring of air quality, personal exposure tracking, assessment of food quality,
    detection

    of hazardous chemicals, and breath analysis. In addition, using a smartphone camera

    to analyze their response quantitatively is another attractive characteristic.
    Colorimetric

    sensors typically employ various organic compounds for capturing target molecules,
    such

    as dyes, fetal organic complexes, and polymers [118]. Colorimetric sensors operate
    based on

    various mechanisms. One is based on the ring opening and closing reactions [117].
    Various

    dyes and organic compounds of aromatic structures with several conjugated π-systems
    can

    be used as colorimetric sensors based on the ring opening and closing reactions.
    This leads

    to a change in the number of conjugated π-bindings.

    Change in the number of conjugated π-systems or lengthening/extending of a conju-

    gated system leads to a shift in the absorbance spectra of a material; i.e., the
    wavelength of

    the photon captured is affected. Thus, speciﬁc photons are captured, leading to
    a measur-

    able change in the material’s color and, therefore, the detection of a target
    analyte. Another

    mechanism exploited for colorimetric sensors is based on functional groups. These
    are

    speciﬁc moieties that can enrich the characteristic features of organic compounds
    and

    increase reactivity [117]. One such example is organic compounds with hydroxyl
    groups

    that can oxidise quickly. Reaction with a target gas changes these functional
    groups to other

    functional groups, leading to a detectable material color change. In a different
    colorimetric

    sensor mechanism, ligand exchange is exploited. Electronic transitions in the
    energy level

    of d-orbitals deﬁne the color of transition metal complexes. Ligands around transition

    metal ions can affect these. If they are changed or substituted, the interaction
    between the

    d-orbitals of the transition metal and the electron cloud of the ligand is affected,
    changing

    the electrons’ state, thus leading to the absorption of different wavelengths
    of light and,

    hence, to a color change. Another common approach is based on phase transition.
    Vari-

    ous inorganic compounds can react with gases in a catalytic reaction that leads
    to phase

    transition and, thus, a change in color. One example is iron oxidized in air to
    produce iron

    oxide [117]. Though, the real-world applications of colorimetric gas sensors are
    limited by

    the interference of humidity and their variability. To tackle the interference
    of humidity,

    the use of hydrophobic substrates is suggested. Proposed materials to serve this
    purpose

    include reverse-phase silica thin-layer-chromatography plates, polyvinylidene
    ﬂuoride

    membranes, and polyethylene terephthalate ﬁlms. However, the main drawback of
    colori-

    metric sensors is that they are limited to ionic compound detectors, making them
    less ideal

    for effectively sensing gaseous hazardous and toxic substances [120–124].

    4.2. Optical

    Optical-based gas sensors have the advantages of fast response (allowing rapid
    real-time

    detection) with minimum drift (owing to absorption of gas molecules at a specific
    wavelength)

    and extreme gas specificity and sensitivity without disturbing the gas sample.
    If they are

    appropriately designed, cross-response to other gases can be eliminated, which
    makes optical

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    21 of 73

    gas sensors inherently reliable [125,126]. Furthermore, optical gas sensors can
    distinguish

    various gas species by comparing their unique gas optical fingerprints. Optical
    gas sensors,

    thus, exhibit remarkably high selectivity, with exceptional physical and chemical
    stability

    compared to chemiresistive metal oxide sensors. There are several different optical
    techniques

    available that are suitable for gas sensing. These include non-dispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    sensing, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS), tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy

    (TDLAS), and spectrophotometry, some of that are discussed below.

    NDIR gas sensing is a popular optical technique. The gas sample is kept in a small

    compartment, and an IR light source is passed through it, reaching an IR detector.
    The

    recorded spectrum provides indicative peaks at different wavelengths corresponding
    to

    absorption bands speciﬁc for different analytes [127–129]. This arises from vibrations
    of the

    gas atoms and allows the selective detection of multiple gases simultaneously,
    provided

    there is no overlap in their ﬁngerprint absorption spectra. Most toxic gases demonstrate

    strong absorption in the mid-IR (2.5–14 µm), about 100 times more than in the
    near-IR

    region [127]. The stability/drift of the light source is recognized as a factor
    that can

    negatively impact measurement precision in these systems, together with noise
    in the

    detector, humidity, and the optical path required [127,129]. When analyzing gas
    mixtures, a

    long optical path is needed that can consist of multiple detectors, optical beam
    splitters and

    ﬁlters, and other components, increasing the overall system size, complexity and
    cost [128].

    While such systems have become small and more portable, their wearable implementation

    can be challenging.

    A multi-pass multi-channel system was proposed for multi-gas detection [130].
    Using

    a single broadband incandescent light source and three optical path lengths of
    24, 36,

    and 48 cm, three different gases could be detected: CO2, CH4, or N2O with sub-ppm

    resolution, combined with H2O and CO2 for monitoring with a 1 ppm resolution.
    Three

    wavelength-selective detectors were mounted to one of the two facing mirrors of
    the optical

    cell, separated by a complete propagation cycle between the spherical mirrors
    and at

    each path length. The device’s response time was measured to be in the region
    of 15 s.

    Measurement precision was found to be better than 0.1 ppm for CO2 and N2O, about

    0.4 ppm for CH4, and 2 ppm for H2O. In addition, the system’s power consumption
    was

    below 0.5 W, and the device size was equal to 4 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm.

    Spectroscopic measurements using quantum cascade laser (QCL) technology are also

    typical [128]. These are stacked atomic-level thickness semiconductor lasers in
    the mid-

    IR, focused using several lenses. However, they require vacuum pumps, alignment
    of

    their optics, chambers, and overall large, costly embodiments, making them unsuitable

    for wearable applications. Therefore, QCLs have been combined with PAS, tunable
    IR

    laser differential absorption spectroscopy (TIL-DAS), wavelength modulation spectroscopy

    (WMS), and quartz enhancement, among others, to reduce their overall size and
    improve

    portability [128]. In one approach, an external-cavity QCL (EC-QCL) was developed
    for

    the simultaneous detection of CH4, N2O, and H2O vapor using off-beam quartz-enhanced

    photoacoustic spectroscopy (OB-QEPAS) [131]. The excitation wavelength was scanned

    over the three absorption lines of CH4 (1260.81 cm−1), N2O (1261.06 cm−1), and
    H2O vapor

    (1261.58 cm−1) by tuning the grating of the EC-QCL with a piezoelectric actuator.
    The

    impact in the generation of QEPAS signals due to light absorption by CH4 and N2O
    was

    investigated in the mid-IR region around 8 µm. Water vapor has a beneﬁcial inﬂuence,

    which enhanced the QEPAS signals by three times for CH4 in the air and by 20%
    for N2O in

    the air compared to those in dry samples. It is, thus, essential to monitor the
    water content

    in measured samples when using this method. This approach achieved LODs of 98
    ppbv

    for CH4, 12 ppbv for N2O, and 750 ppmv for H2O vapor in humidiﬁed gas mixtures.
    When

    applying a real-time Kalman ﬁlter to improve measurement precision by a factor
    of ~4

    while keeping the same temporal resolution, these numbers changed to 60 ppbv for
    CH4,

    10 ppbv for N2O, and 0.07% for H2O in the measurements of 1.99 ppmv CH4 and 312
    ppbv

    N2O humidiﬁed with 2.8% H2O vapor.

    Optical-ﬁber-based gas sensors also operate at RT. One such example is the multi-

    mode interference of single-mode—no-core—single-mode ﬁber (SNS) structure with
    MoS2

    nanosheets as the sensitive ﬁlm presented in [126] and allowed measurements of
    formic

    acid from 0 to 250 ppm in 50 ppm steps. Another optical approach is quartz-enhanced

    photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) and its variant beat-frequency quartz-enhanced
    pho-

    toacoustic spectroscopy (BF-QEPAS) using a quartz tuning fork (QTF) as a resonant
    acoustic

    transducer operating at the mid-infrared (MIR) with a quantum cascade laser. BF-QEPAS

    allows rapidly and simultaneously obtaining the resonance frequency and Q-factor
    of the

    QTF and the trace gas concentration. For example, examining the adsorption–desorption
    ef-

    fect and optimizing the modulation depth and frequency has enabled an ammonia
    detection

    limit of 9.5 ppb with an integration time of 3 ms with BF-QEPAS [125].

    Mid-wave infrared (MWIR) absorption spectroscopy is another gas-sensing method

    worth mentioning, as it is suitable for mass-producing compact and inexpensive
    devices

    and systems [132]. A MWIR graphene photodetector was recently proposed that is
    inte-

    grated into silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) slot waveguides for on-chip absorption spectroscopy

    measurements of gases. Simulations indicated that the detection of CO2, CH4, and
    N2O

    with an LOD below ppb levels (0.14, 0.72, and 0.52 ppb, respectively, at 2 mW
    source power)

    could be achievable with the proposed device [132].

    Additionally, incorporating functional nanomaterials such as polymers, noble metal/metal

    oxide composites, graphene, and its derivatives into optical gas sensors can enable
    gas inter-

    action with the sensitive evanescent field of the transmitted optical mode by
    the adsorbed

    gas molecules [133,134]. However, sophisticated interferometers or resonators
    such as Mach–

    Zehnder interferometers (MZI) and Bragg gratings are needed to correct the sensor
    output

    based on the wavelength shifts. This can considerably increase the design and
    fabrication

    cost [135]. As an alternative, fiber-optic-based gas sensors such as fiber tips
    and tapered/D-

    shaped fibers are relatively more straightforward in design and fabrication [4].

    Generally speaking, optical approaches are not the most suitable sensing techniques

    for wearable applications, due to their overall size, especially when considering
    a complete

    system, their power consumption, and aspects related to wearability (ﬂexibility,
    stretchabil-

    ity, mechanical robustness, etc.). However, they are discussed herein for completeness
    and

    in an effort to stimulate future research into the wearability of such sensing
    approaches.

    4.3. Electrochemical

    Compared to traditional instrumentation approaches, which require specialized
    appa-

    ratus and complicated protocols, electrochemical sensors have several distinct
    advantages

    when it comes to detecting environmental contaminants. As a result, they have
    been

    applied in various applications, including clinical diagnostics, food safety and
    quality,

    biological analysis, and environmental monitoring. These advantages include ease
    of

    use, low cost and power consumption, high miniaturization, and relatively simple
    instru-

    mentation [136]. When it comes to wearable sensors, biocompatibility is an additional

    consideration. Electrochemical gas sensors are relatively more speciﬁc than other
    methods

    to detect individual gases and have ppm- or ppb-level sensitivity. However, similarly
    to

    semiconductor-based sensors, they suffer from cross-response issues and have a
    limited

    lifetime [137–139]. In addition, they are susceptible to temperature ﬂuctuations;
    thus, the

    temperature should be kept constant and ideally known [140].

    Like other types of sensors, the electrode materials should have high conductivity.

    However, they should also have an excellent electrochemical potential window and
    catalytic

    activity. The electrochemical interaction at the analyte–electrode interface leads
    to an

    electrically detectable signal proportional to the concentration of the analyte
    that was

    engaged in the process. There are several different electrochemical methods. The
    most

    commonly used in gas-sensing applications are cyclic voltammetry (CV, where a
    cycling

    triangular voltage excitation is applied to the electrochemical cell and a resulting
    current

    is measured) and amperometry, where a constant potential known to facilitate a
    redox

    reaction in the studied system is applied, and the resulting current is again
    measured.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    23 of 73

    Typically, a three-electrode cell is used in these electrochemical techniques,
    composed of

    a working (WE), a counter (CE), and a reference electrode (RE). The CE, typically
    made

    of Pt, should ideally have a surface area 10 times greater than the WE, so its
    interfacial

    impedance does not become a signiﬁcant part of the measurement. The RE is typically
    a

    standard Ag/AgCl electrode. If the current can be made small and the ohmic drop
    between

    CE and RE can be made inﬁnitesimal by placing the electrode very closely together
    through

    their miniaturization, then two electrodes, a WE and a CE, can also be used [128,141].

    Depending on the applications, CV can be exploited as a ﬁrst step to identify
    the redox

    potential required for amperometric measurements, which can serve as the main
    detection

    method, as it is a simpler method. It is important to note that different gases
    have different

    redox potentials. For example, O2 and CO2 have less negative reduction potentials
    than

    N2O, while N2 has higher [128].

    Amperometric gas sensors are often based on electrochemical fuel cell technology.

    Catalysts that are highly loaded with Pt are typically used to catalyze the oxidation
    re-

    action of the targeted gases at the WE and the oxygen reduction reaction at the
    CE [142].

    Nevertheless, Pt is expensive, and another disadvantage is its poisoning by various
    gases

    when used in ambient conditions, which hampers sensor performance over time. Other

    common electrode materials include Rh, Ru, Pd, Au, Ir, and Ag. Nevertheless, carbon-based

    materials are also common. Typically, the WE is either within a sensing chamber
    or is itself

    porous. In any case, some kind of porous diffusion barrier is often employed.
    Increase

    of the applied potential leads to an increase in the reaction rate until it reaches
    a plateau,

    where the diffusion ﬂow of the target gas is maximized. Another electrochemical
    method

    that can be exploited for gas detection is potentiometry. This method requires
    the use of

    only two electrodes and relies on the measurement of the difference in the polarization

    potential between two electrodes, one indifferent (RE) electrode whose potential
    is ideally

    always stable and unaffected by changes in its electrochemical environment and
    a WE,

    where the actual detection of target analytes takes place.

    In contrast to amperometry and CV, in potentiometry, there is no current ﬂow.
    The

    open circuit potential formed at the electrode interfaces is deﬁned by the Nernst
    equation

    and it is, thus, logarithmically related to gas concentration. It is, thus, less
    sensitive to

    low concentrations, in contrast to amperometric sensors, where the limiting current
    is

    linearly related to the gas concentration. One common potentiometric gas sensor
    example

    is the lambda sensor employed for the detection of oxygen in exhaust gases with
    a solid

    oxide electrolyte (YSZ, discussed further below). Another type of sensors are
    mixed

    potential gas sensors, where multiple reactions take place, leading to a non-Nernstian

    response that does not reach equilibrium as in potentiometric sensors, and a mixed
    potential

    is observed. This method is typically used for measurements in non-equilibrium
    gas

    mixtures containing H2, CO, CO2, hydrocarbons, SO2, NOx, NH3, and H2S [143]. Primarily

    portable and benchtop mixed potential sensors have been demonstrated [144–148].
    An

    investigation towards wearable and room-temperature realizations of such gas-sensing

    devices could be a promising research direction. In addition to the above, there
    are also

    mixed amperometric/potentiometric sensing systems composed of two cells, as a
    means

    of improving overall system sensing performance. Finally, electrochemical impedance

    spectroscopy (EIS) gas sensors are another approach often used, where the electrochemical

    cell is excited with a sinusoidal voltage of varying frequency. EIS is typically
    used with

    semiconductor-based and solid-oxide-based sensors.

    At this point, it is also important to highlight that the two or three electrodes
    are

    spatially separated. A conductive medium is required to close the circuit and
    allow the

    current ﬂow or to establish the polarization potentials at each electrode. This
    is typically

    achieved through an electrolyte, which can be either in liquid or solid forms,
    with the latter

    preferred for portable and wearable instrumentation. These are known as solid-electrolyte-

    based electrochemical gas sensors. Some solid electrolytes demonstrating ionic
    conductivity

    include AgS, Cu2S, 85 mass% zirconia and 15 mass% yttria (YSZ), or ﬂuorites such
    as ZrO2

    that is stabilized with Y, Yb, Ca, and Sc oxides, or their mixture, CeO2-based
    materials doped

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    24 of 73

    with lanthanides, and lanthanum gallate (LaGaO3)-based materials, LaYO3 and SrZrO3,
    and

    BaCeO3 and yttria-doped BaCeO3, although these can be properties encountered at
    elevated

    temperatures (e.g., 600 ◦C), unsuitable for wearable applications [143]. Care
    must be taken

    to increase the selectivity and speciﬁcity of a particular gas. Several approaches
    have been

    exploited to achieve this. One approach involves the use of two electrochemical
    cells. In the

    ﬁrst, a reduction potential is used that is below that for the target gas, the
    reduction potential

    of which is used in the second cell. This potential can reduce other species in
    the mixture.

    The difference in the recorded current can thus indicate the target gas concentration.

    Alternatively, reducing interfering gases can be used to completely remove them
    from the

    gas mixture, such that sensing of the target gas can be facilitated in a subsequent
    chamber.

    Another approach involves the choice of the electrolyte used. Scavengers of interfering

    gases can be exploited in one- or two-compartment devices to eliminate them from
    the

    measurement. For example, scavengers of O2 include alkaline ascorbate solutions
    and

    diphenylphosphine in propylene carbonate. Several recent electrochemical gas sensor

    examples were recently reviewed elsewhere [143].

    One recent example is a platform for the selective electrochemical sensing of
    nitrite

    based on SnO2/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si [149]. The sensor was produced by depositing a material

    composed of SnO2 onto a substrate consisting of SiO2/Si. Synthesis of SnO2 was
    accom-

    plished through the microwave irradiation method (MW), and the coating of SnO2
    on the

    substrate was found to generate free electrons. By depositing a Ti/Pt interlayer
    on the

    substrate, the adherence of the SnO2 coating can be further improved. In addition
    to that

    function, this interlayer served as the metallic contact electrode layer. The
    sensor exhibited

    the highest level of electrochemical sensing when exposed to nitrite. In addition,
    it can be

    utilized to analyze nitrite levels in samples of beer, milk, municipal water,
    and mineral

    water. A linear response and a lower LOD of approximately 10–400 µM and 1.7 (±0.1)
    µM

    were achieved. The MW approach provides a route for synthesizing SnO2 that is
    quick

    and reproducible. In addition, the MW-based SnO2 coatings had a higher conductivity
    and

    sensitivity than those created using the traditional sol-gel process.

    4.4. Transistors

    In these types of sensors, sensing is achieved through a transistor, mainly using
    the

    MOS FET. One advantage of transistor-based sensors is that they have the potential
    for high

    miniaturization and a high level of integration with all the necessary readout
    electronics

    in the form of a standalone integrated circuit. Consequently, they are highly
    suited for

    wearable applications. Furthermore, they have the potential to overcome limitations
    found

    in other technologies concerning size, power consumption, dynamic range, and sensitiv-

    ity [150]. On the other hand, although semiconductor-based gas sensors are susceptible

    at the low ppm level, they suffer from changing humidity levels which can cause
    drift

    and cross-response to other gases [151–153]. The subject and fundamental operation
    of

    the various approaches for FET-based sensing were recently reviewed [154], and,
    thus,

    here, we will focus on recent developments. Brieﬂy, we will summarize the basic
    strategies

    proposed for FET-based gas sensing. As it will be further elucidated, there are
    two main

    approaches to achieving FET-based gas sensing. Sensing can either be performed
    (a) via

    the gate or (b) directly through the semiconducting channel.

    4.4.1. Gate Sensing

    Often, detection is performed at the gate of a MOSFET. For example, one of the
    tran-

    sistors in a differential input pair of an instrumentation or operational ampliﬁer
    can be a

    gas-sensing transistor, allowing the direct measurement of an analyte by transforming
    a

    change in transistor gate potential relevant to a reference potential into a proportional
    drain

    current based on the device’s IV characteristics. Gas sensors are often based
    on a resistance

    change from gas-oxide redox reactions on transition metal-oxides [150]. Alternatively,

    instead of directly reacting with the metal oxide, the detected gas reacts with
    the surround-

    ing oxygen, improving stability for long-term use. A sensing ﬁlm is required to
    enhance

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    25 of 73

    sensitivity and selectivity. Various 2D materials have been proposed for chemiresistive-type

    NOx gas sensors. These include TMDs, graphene, and black phosphorous [150].

    As discussed elsewhere in detail [154], gate-based FET sensing can be achieved
    via

    multiple approaches. The earliest approach is based on the catalytic metal-gate
    FET [155].

    Detection is based on changes in the dipole moment formed at the interface between

    the metal gate and the gate insulator. This dipole layer is formed through the
    catalytic

    reaction at the gate that leads to penetration of the gas molecules through the
    metal. This

    modulates the threshold voltage and, thus, the channel current of the device.
    However, the

    applicability of this approach is limited by the molecular size of the target
    gas. To address

    this, the suspended-gate FET (SGFET) was proposed. This structure employs an air
    gap

    that allows gases of any molecular size to be detected. However, the SGFET is
    challenging

    to manufacture; thus, various variations of this architecture have been proposed.
    One is

    the capacitively coupled FET (CCFET), which can reduce the operating voltage required

    and increase sensitivity through enhanced gate coupling [154].

    An air gap is still present, but, in contrast to the SGFET, a portion of the gate
    is in

    contact with the gate oxide. Essentially, there is a capacitor, with one of its
    plates covered

    with a sensing layer and a ﬂoating potential, coupled to the gate electrode of
    the FET.

    The other has a well-deﬁned potential and acts as the source electrode. Adsorption
    of

    gas molecules on the ﬂoating gate changes its potential, changing the channel
    current.

    Finally, the horizontal ﬂoating-gate FET (HFGFET) is the most recent and probably
    the

    most common approach that combines many of the aforementioned approaches [154].
    A

    control and a ﬂoating gate are horizontally fabricated in the same place. The
    control gate is

    directly connected to the sensing layer, and the ﬂoating gate is insulated. The
    sensing layer

    sits on top of both, allowing a higher coupling ratio between these two layers.
    As a result,

    gases of any molecular size can be sensed, and, since there is no need for an
    air gap, the

    manufacturing challenges faced by the SGFET and CCFET are eliminated. In addition,
    like

    the catalytic gate FET, the HFGFET is more compatible with standard CMOS processes.
    A

    similar approach has recently been exploited, as explained below.

    SnSe2 is a TMD with a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and it has been used
    in

    CMOS-compatible gas sensors. Recently, a fully CMOS-technology-compatible gas
    sensing

    system was presented [150]. This work proposed ﬂoating-gate devices composed of
    two

    inputs. This highly integrated CMOS chip was designed and fabricated with a standard

    commercial 28 nm CMOS technology node and post-processed for incorporating a SnSe2

    ﬁlm. Figure 6a illustrates the proposed approach, and the technology nodes’ metal
    layers

    and the interdigital electrodes used. The proposed structure was composed of a
    reading

    gate (RG), a sensing gate (SG) used for the detection of NO2, and a ﬂoating gate
    (FG).

    The potential in the SG is coupled with the FG, which alters the FET’s channel
    current.

    Changing the SG-to-RG coupling ratio adjusts the coupled potential. An interdigital

    metal–oxide–metal (MOM) capacitor structure was used to couple the FG, RG, and
    SG, as

    shown in Figure 6a,b. Such a structure possesses a relatively high aspect ratio,
    providing a

    strong capacitive coupling effect that further enhances sensitivity. Several readout
    circuit

    approaches were proposed. The ﬁrst involved a potential divider formed with a
    standard

    resistor and a SnSe2-sensing ﬁlm. The varying potential was coupled to the FGMOS
    circuit

    of Figure 6c with the RG set to 0V, leading to an overall sensitivity of 15.42%.
    Different

    sensing gate coupling ratios lead to a diverse range of measured currents as a
    function of

    gas concentration (Figure 6d). In another approach, the threshold voltage was
    exploited

    to ﬁx the channel current through a self-balanced circuit (Figure 6f) comprised
    of the

    FGMOS transistor and an operational ampliﬁer (opamp) in negative feedback feeding

    the RG potential. This approach achieved a 102 mV ppm-1 sensitivity in the 1–25
    ppm

    NOx range. RT operation was conducted by optimizing the coupling capacitors and
    the

    sensing ﬁlm thickness. At the same time, process variations could be calibrated
    by adjusting

    the sensing range of the circuit through the reference voltage in the opamp-based
    circuit

    of Figure 6e,f. The 3 × 3 and 16 × 16 gas sensing arrays with peripheral circuits
    were

    demonstrated to detect multiple gases simultaneously, showing a unique and complete

    Gas-sensing FETs often perform sensing through the semiconducting channel. How-

    ever, this may impact the intrinsic properties of the device, hindering its operation
    as an

    active circuit element. Thus, isolating it from the gas and performing detection
    at the gate

    allows us to exploit the stable properties of the FET for processing the gas-depended
    signal

    arising at the gate. This was demonstrated by using a CNT ﬁlm as the semiconducting

    channel, and a Y2O3 dielectric layer, with the detection of HCHO, achieved at
    a Pd/Au cat-

    alytic metal gate and leading to a 20 ppb LOD at RT between 20 to 800 ppb. The
    device has

    a hole mobility of 1812 cm2/Vs. The high sensitivity at RT is attributed to the
    ampliﬁcation

    achieved with the device.

    Nevertheless, at RT, the sensor does not fully recover to baseline values and
    drifts

    upwards at 18.5% over time. However, operating the sensor at 150 ◦C allows complete

    recovery (97%), a lower LOD of 10 ppb, improved linearity from 0.86 to 0.99 (linear

    correlation coefﬁcient, R), and minimization of the baseline drift. The speciﬁc
    operating

    temperature and gate material allow selectivity towards HCHO. The humidity did
    not affect

    the device operation (up to 80% RH), while the device also demonstrated long-term
    stability

    in 20-day measurements at 80 ppb [155]. Work function variations due to gas adsorption

    on the gate change the channel current. When physisorption takes place, a dipole
    layer is

    formed on the gate, increasing the work function of the gate, and shrinking the
    conductive

    channel due to additional holes induced around the semiconducting CNT surface,
    leading

    to a smaller channel current. At elevated temperatures, where chemisorption occurs,
    the

    current trend is reversed. Due to the difference in chemical potentials between
    the Pd/Au

    gate and the gas, chemical reactions take place. The gate will dissociate chemisorbed
    HCHO

    molecules to yield hydrogen that diffuses between the gate and the dielectric
    forming a

    dipole layer. This broadens the conductive channel and, thus, increases the channel
    current.

    The stacked Pd-Au gate plays a crucial role in the device’s performance; Au is
    the chemical

    sensitizer, while the synergistic effect of the bimetallic structure enhances
    sensitivity by

    promoting the chemical reaction of HCHO [155] (Figure 7).

    4.4.2. Channel Sensing

    Alternatively, the transistor channel can be sensorized, allowing a direct change
    in

    the drain-source current due to a transduction mechanism for a deﬁned gate potential.

    To ensure that the measured response is only due to the channel, all other areas
    of the

    device, especially source and drain metal contacts, must be sufﬁciently passivated.
    Much

    of the research focuses on developing novel transistor architectures and materials
    for the

    transduction mechanism. One material that holds great promise in many electronics
    and

    sensing applications is graphene. As a transistor channel material, it has also
    been explored

    for gas sensing. One such approach involved the development of n-doped graphene

    with ethylene amines that increase the device’s carrier mobility and creates speciﬁcity
    and

    sensitivity in the channel current to oxidizing gases [156]. Upon exposure to
    oxidizing gases

    such as NO2 at a ﬁxed 0 V gate voltage, the channel current decrease depends strongly
    on

    the number of amine functional groups in various ethylene amines. Non-destructive
    vapor-

    phase molecular doping under applied heat with diethylenetriamine (DETA) has been

    reported to lead to a high response, recovery, and long-term sensing stability
    to NO2 when

    compared to other doping agents such as ethylenediamine (EDA) and triethylenetetramine

    (TETA). An average LOD of 0.83 parts per quadrillion (ppq, 10−15) was reported
    due to the

    attractive electrostatic interaction between electron-rich graphene and electron-deﬁcient

    NO2 [157]. Oxidizing gas molecules of NO2 or SO2 introduced charged impurities
    leading

    to an enhanced decrease in the channel current. On the other hand, the absence
    of such a

    strong interaction between DETA-n-doped graphene and NH3, combined with different

    effects, leads to insensitivity to NH3 [156].

    InGaZnO (IGZO) is a promising material for thin-ﬁlm transistor realization, especially

    for ﬂexible transistors on thin, ﬂexible substrates [157]. IGZO has also been
    exploited for

    gas sensing. A top contact bottom gate IGZO transistor with a 107 on/off ratio
    and a charge

    carrier mobility of 7.6 cm2V−1s−1 has been used for sensing NO2 [158]. In the
    presence

    of NO2, measurable changes in the threshold voltage (VTh) and drain current (ID)
    of the

    device were observed due to the adsorption of the gas onto the IGZO channel. Adsorption

    due to the high electronic afﬁnity of NO2 and its electrophilic nature leads to
    the oxidation

    of IGZO and a resulting charge carrier depletion. Illumination with a blue (450
    nm) LED at

    1 mW/cm2 restored the device to its condition before NO2 gas exposure [158]. The
    required

    illumination duration depends on the NO2 gas concentration. The exposed (unpassivated)

    sensing IGZO was diode-connected, generating a current for a set VDD proportional
    to the

    NO2 concentration. The rest of the transistors were insulated to ensure their
    characteristics

    remained unaltered in the presence of NO2. A simple NMOS current mirror was realized

    with two passivated IGZO transistors copying the sensing IGZO current into a second

    branch. A third passivated IGZO was diode-connected and set to a VDD1 voltage
    to

    create a competing current that would trigger an inverter when the NO2 concentration

    exceeded an established limit. This, thus, created a 1-bit detector. Copying the
    current to

    branches with a different current, thus, allows thresholding at different levels
    and, thus,

    increases the system’s sensing resolution (bits) to detect various gas levels
    [159]. Power

    consumption was in the µW range for the complete readout system, which did not
    require

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    29 of 73

    additional ampliﬁers or analogue-to-digital converters. The LOD of the IGZO RT
    sensor

    was 100 ppb [158].

    Organic gas-sensing FETs (OFTs) have also been proposed, where gas sensing is

    achieved through the exposure of the organic semiconductor and the corresponding
    change

    of drain current due to a speciﬁc gas. Doping of the organic semiconductor, change
    of its

    dipole moment, or change in the morphology of the organic ﬁlm are various mechanisms

    that have been proposed to explain gas sensing with such devices [159]. One advantage

    of organic ﬁeld effect transistors is that they can be operated in RT and can
    be solution-

    processed using inexpensive methods (e.g., spin-coating) and fabricated on ﬂexible
    plastic

    substrates. Nevertheless, a common barrier to their widespread use arises due
    to the dete-

    rioration of these devices by humid air. In n-type organic semiconductors, humidity
    can

    generate electron traps at the edge of the conduction band. At the same time,
    in p-type ma-

    terials, it acts as a dopant that increases the off-current of the device [159].
    Typically, OFTs

    are encapsulated to address this issue. However, this is not possible in gas-sensing
    applica-

    tions, as the channel needs to be exposed, and, thus, they will be exposed to
    humidity. This

    was recently addressed with the use of molecular additives of tetracyanoquinodimethane

    (TCNQ) and 4-aminobenzonitrile (ABN) in an indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole

    (IDT-BT) semiconductor. This approach eliminates moisture adsorption, leading
    to a re-

    versible, stable response for NH3 sensors that can operate for over 5 h continuously
    and

    in humid air for 16 days [159]. Detection is performed by the n-type doping effect
    of the

    IDT-BT channel by amine in the NH3 gas.

    A bottom gate architecture, which allowed the organic channel to be exposed and
    on

    the top of the device (W/L = 1 mm/100 µm), was implemented using a ﬂexible plastic

    PEN substrate. The bare IDT-BT sensor demonstrated a sensitivity of 20%, a recovery
    of

    37%, and high degradation in the air. The IDT-BT:ABN achieved a sensitivity of
    17.53%

    in 100 ppm NH3 and 100% recovery in N2 and the air, and it reached the most extended

    lifetime of 84 days in the air. Finally, the IDT-BT:TCNQ sensor achieved a 23.14%
    sensitivity

    at 10 ppm NH3 gas and a 100% recovery in N2 and air, characteristics that were
    maintained

    for over 16 days and after 1200 bending cycles. Thus, IDT-BT:TCNQ OFET sensors
    achieved

    the best sensing performance and air stability. Greater reliability and air stability
    with the

    ABN and TCNQ additives were achieved due to the replacement of moisture present
    in

    the IDT-BT ﬁlms generated from the solvents used during ﬁlm deposition that can
    remain

    even after the annealing steps. In examinations regarding speciﬁcity, the sensors
    did not

    yield a distinct response in the presence of CO, CO2, and NO2, apart from NO [159].

    SWCNTs acting as a gas-sensitive semiconducting channel in SWCNT-FETs have

    also been demonstrated [37,160].

    As described previously, detection is primarily at-

    tributed to modifying the Schottky barrier at the SWCNT/electrode junction or
    doping

    the SWCNT [37,160]. SWCNT-FETs have enhanced reactivity to electron-donor gases,
    such

    as NO2 [160]. Such gas-sensing SWCNT-FETs have been manufactured on ﬂexible plastic

    substrates for wearable applications [160]. Controlling the number of SWCNTs and,
    thus,

    their density, as well as their length, and the removal of metallic tubes by applying
    selec-

    tive electrical breakdown, allow control of the semiconducting properties of the
    channel.

    Several isolated individual SWCNTs connected between source and drain interdigitated

    electrodes lead to an enhanced response when compared to using a single SWCNT
    (limited

    NO2 active site) or large randomly deposited dense networks (junctions between
    SWCNTs

    and or metallic tubes hinder or suppress the effect of the Schottky barrier modulation).

    Such devices can have on/off current ratio of 105 [37].

    NO2 gas sensing leads to measurable changes in the depletion-mode current and
    the

    threshold voltage. The latter should not be used, as trapped charges may modify
    it. An

    exponential relationship with a second power law relationship in a log–log plot
    has been

    found. Adsorption of NO2 leads to an increase in the work function of the Pd electrodes

    and, thus, a reduction in the barrier height to hole carriers, leading to an increase
    in the off

    current as a function of NO2 concentration [37]. Characterizing the transfer characteristics

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    30 of 73

    of such devices can be challenging since the channel current can vary within the
    range of

    10−12 to 10−3 A [160].

    In addition, looking at the SWCNT-FET as a standalone device is challenging since

    many device characteristics can change simultaneously, such as the shape or slope
    of the

    transfer characteristics, the threshold voltage, the drain current, and the on/off
    currents. It

    is, thus, a tedious procedure to monitor and interpret all these parameters. This
    comes with

    challenges in using these devices as a standalone element, requiring large power-hungry

    implementations. To address this, the gas-sensing transistor was implemented as
    part

    of an electronic circuit, an inverter, and an elementary digital circuit [160].
    In this way,

    the readout implementation and interpretation of the results are greatly simpliﬁed.
    This

    inverter combined two SWCNT-FETs, a p-type SWCNT-FET sensing device and an n-type

    SWCNT-FET, resulting in a complementary structure (CMOS), and, thus, the output
    to

    be monitored is now a voltage rather than a current that was sensitive to NO2.
    Detection

    was, therefore, performed by monitoring the change in the amplitude of the square
    wave

    output of the inverter. The n-type device was rendered insensitive to NO2 within
    the 0.6 to

    10 ppm range through the deposition of a thick PEI hermetic sealing ﬁlm, so detection
    is

    only due to the p-type device. The sensing device is fully reversible. However,
    the time

    required for it to return to baseline values depends on the amount of NO2 it is
    exposed to;

    at 10 ppm, this is 5 h. This can be reduced either through heating or UV exposure.
    As the

    gas concentration increased, a decrease in the output square wave amplitude was
    observed.

    The sensitivity and LOD of the inverter depended on the supply voltage with an
    optimum

    of 4 V leading to an LOD of 0.57 ppm and the smallest error, and similar behaviors
    for 6 V.

    Due to the higher sensitivity at these supply voltages, a 2 V supply should be
    used for high

    gas concentrations as the other examined supplies would saturate [160].

    Another recently proposed approach involves the use of MoS2. This atomic layer

    material can take several forms based on its processing. Chemical exfoliation
    to isolate

    MoS2 through lithium intercalation is one approach to obtaining this auspicious
    monolayer

    material. Charge transfer from lithium-ion to monolayer MoS2 leads to a phase
    transition

    from a direct bandgap semiconducting trigonal prismatic (2H) to a metastable conducting

    octahedral (1T) co-ordination [161]. However, 1T-MoS2 is thermodynamically unstable
    and

    transforms into the 2H form at elevated temperatures. The metastable 1T phase
    has higher

    conductivity for charge transfer and adsorption energy for NOx, making it suitable
    for gas

    sensing. At the same time, it leads to smaller contact resistances in FET devices.
    The 2H has

    a large 1.8 V bandgap impeding gas adsorption, but it is thermodynamically more
    stable

    and has a chemically active surface and edge sites for catalytic activities [161].

    Consequently, one approach could involve combining both phases into a 1T/2H MoS2

    heterostructure to exploit the advantages of gas sensing of NO2. Gas-sensing behavior
    is

    highly dependent on the 1T/2H ratio, which has to be tuned via thermal annealing
    to a

    ratio of 0.67 that yields the best performance of a sensitivity of 25% at 2 ppm
    and a response

    time of 10 s [161]. Then, 300 nm of SiO2 served as the gate oxide, and a bottom
    gate top

    channel architecture was once again used to allow direct exposure of the channel
    to the gas.

    The Si substrate served as the device’s back gate, and the MoS2 was deposited
    between

    the interdigitated source/drain Au electrodes. Thermal annealing was used to convert

    1T to 2H. Nevertheless, even at RT, there is a 2H phase present in the material
    (about

    30%). Raising the temperature to 100 ◦C increases that to 61%, and it further
    increases to

    96% at 300 ◦C. This p-type device arises from water and/or oxygen adsorption during

    the monolayer fabrication steps and through the heterostructure. Thermal annealing
    at

    100 ◦C also improves the electrical contact between the monolayer and the electrodes

    by reducing its resistance. However, further temperature increases increase the
    device

    resistance due to the lower conductivity of the 2H phase. Thermal annealing at
    100 ◦C

    also improves the on/off current ratio, improving the device performance (from
    1.29 to

    1.47). Sensor sensitivity is maximized at that annealing temperature, and the
    response

    times are improved (20 s at 2 ppm). At 25 ppb NO2, representing the LOD, more
    than

    1% sensitivity is achieved through monitoring the channel current. The recovery
    time,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    31 of 73

    however, reaches the worst performance compared to other annealing temperatures.
    At RT,

    the device demonstrated high selectivity to NO2 [161].

    Large arrays of MoS2-based FETs have also been demonstrated [162]. In contrast
    to

    chemical exfoliation, which has poor reproducibility and leads to ﬁlms of poor
    uniformity,

    radio frequency magnetron sputtering was used with a subsequent step of thermal
    sul-

    furization for the MoS2 layer of the transistors. In the presence of NO2 at RT,
    the device

    exhibited a reduction in mobility and a positive threshold voltage shift; the
    channel current

    is reduced with increasing NO2 concentration due to the decrease in the conductivity
    of the

    semiconducting channel. A W/L of 20 µm/7 µm was used, and the devices demonstrated

    a threshold voltage of 13.5 V; thus, the VGS of 0 V pushed the device into the
    subthreshold

    operating regime, where MoS2 FETs typically exhibit a higher response. VDS was
    kept at

    1 V. An on/off current ratio of 2 × 106 was also achieved. In addition, a response
    of 0.5%

    was achieved for 1 ppm NO2, representing this device’s LOD, which also demonstrated

    rapid recovery and good reproducibility when comparing the response of nine identical

    devices. Measurements up to 256 ppm were demonstrated. This approach was used
    to

    create large active-matrix arrays of gas-sensing FETs with 7 × 6 pixels, each
    being individ-

    ually addressed with a MoS2 switch. A local bottom gate separated from the back
    gate

    was used to control the devices fabricated with an 80 nm-thick aluminum oxide
    (Al2O3)

    gate dielectric. An encapsulating 20 nm thick SiO2 dielectric layer was used to
    insulate and

    protect the MoS2 channel of the matrix switches to prevent them from being exposed
    to

    NO2 and, thus, also change [162].

    Hybrid MoOx/graphene FETs have also been proposed, exploiting shadow mask tech-

    niques as a low-cost manufacturing approach. NH3 sensing at 12 ppm was demonstrated

    with such FETs [163]. Graphene channels of 2 mm × 1.5 mm were realized with 3
    nm Mo

    layers covering the graphene by different percentages from 25% to 100% in 25%
    steps. Oxi-

    dation of Mo took place naturally in the air. Ohmic contact was formed between
    graphene

    and S/D contacts, and a p-type behavior was achieved with all devices; this is
    maintained

    through the range of applied voltages from −75 to 100 V. Increasing the graphene
    coverage

    by MoOx increases the relative change in the channel current when the devices
    are exposed

    to a set NO2 concentration while also affecting their recovery. The difference
    is more

    pronounced and faster at higher applied voltages and the better the recovery.
    No heating or

    illumination is required for RT sensing and recovery. A −18.1% response, recovery
    time of

    356 s, repeatability of 12 cycles at 12 ppm after 3 min exposure to NO2, a LOD
    of 310 ppb, a

    sensitivity of 0.1% ppm−1, and complete recovery, all at RT, were achieved with
    the 100%

    covered device. After a 55-month air exposure period, sensing response decreased
    from

    −18.1% to −3.52%, but responses were still observable. Humidity also seems to
    affect the

    response and recovery time of the device [163].

    4.5. Chemiresistors

    Chemiresistive sensing is the most popular sensing approach. The use of chemire-

    sistors has been accelerated in recent decades due to their relatively suitable
    amenability

    for inexpensive portable devices. Gas-sensing approaches achieving higher accuracy
    are

    typically more expensive and complicated and may even be unsuitable for wearable
    appli-

    cations. The mechanism of gas response is based on the change in surface resistance
    due to

    gas interaction [164]. In most printed gas sensors, chemiresistive structures
    are employed to

    detect trace gas amounts due to their response principles to gas analytes through
    changes

    in channel conductance. The structure of a chemiresistor contains two pairs of
    electrodes

    linked together by a ﬁlm of sensing materials, e.g., metals or semiconductors.
    Interdigitated

    electrodes (IDEs) are often employed to boost the sensing response. A known constant

    current or potential can be applied across electrode pairs. The resulting voltage
    or current

    is then measured upon exposure to gaseous analytes to obtain the ﬁlm’s resistance
    through

    Ohm’s law, which is a function of a target gas’s concentration [90].

    The MOS family, including materials such as SnO2, ZnO, In2O3, TiO2, and WO3, is

    frequently used in chemiresistive gas sensors. While CeO2, Fe2O3, CdO, and CuO
    are also

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    32 of 73

    employed in various sensor applications, their primary use in chemiresistive gas
    sensors is

    often as catalytic additives rather than primary sensing materials.

    These materials can be deposited using a wide variety of manufacturing methods,

    such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), hydrothermal growth, co-precipitation,
    thermal

    evaporation, the sol–gel method, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), radio frequency
    (RF),

    and direct current (DC) sputtering. The operational sensing principle of MOSs
    (based on

    the oxygen adsorption and desorption model) is better understood than with other,
    more

    complex materials. At the same time, they also typically offer a higher sensitivity
    and

    faster response and recovery times. MOSs exhibits a change in resistance when
    exposed

    to a target gas, arising from oxidative interactions with the negatively charged
    adsorbed

    oxygen [128]. Whether the MOS is n-type or p-type will deﬁne the polarity of this
    change.

    Under normal atmospheric conditions, atmospheric O2 is adsorbed or chemisorbed
    on the

    material’s surface. An electron-depletion zone is formed due to the extraction
    of electrons

    from the conduction band arising from the adsorption of O2. Consequently, in n-type

    material, reducing agents will release back electrons to the conduction band,
    decreasing

    electrical resistance. On the other hand, in a p-type material (e.g., CoO and
    NiO), O2

    adsorption results in the formation of a hole accumulation region. Exposure to
    reducing

    analytes will then lead to an increase in resistance. The opposite occurs when
    the material

    is in the presence of oxidative agents [128].

    In summary, n-type materials in the presence of an oxidizing agent will demonstrate

    a resistance increase, while, in the presence of a reducing gas, they will demonstrate
    a

    resistance decrease; p-type materials in the presence of an oxidizing agent will
    demonstrate

    a resistance decrease, while, with a reducing agent, they will demonstrate a resistance

    increase. Oxidizing gases act as electron acceptors while reducing gases act as
    donors.

    Between the two types, n-type MOSs (such as materials based on SnO2, In2O3, ZnO,

    TiO2, and WO3) are more common, possibly because they lead to stronger responses.
    A

    drawback of MOSs is the requirement for operation in high temperatures (e.g.,
    100 to

    300 ◦C). The adsorbed oxygen requires high temperatures to become an oxygen anion,
    so it

    can migrate and remove electrons, thus changing the material’s conductivity. To
    improve

    the performance of chemiresistive sensors, the types of sensing materials employed,
    and

    the device fabrication methods should be developed via novel strategies [11].
    Using

    photoexcitation or metal−organic frameworks and noble metals or organic-coated
    MOSs

    can reduce the required operational temperature and modify the sensing mechanism.
    The

    MOS crystal structure, grain size, porosity, the existence of catalysts, the manufacturing

    approach, the sensing ﬁlm thickness, the nano-structuring, and the use of nanomaterials

    of the material can also inﬂuence sensitivity, reaction rate, selectivity, and
    operational

    temperature [128,165].

    Another approach is using two or more metal oxides to form a heterojunction interface.

    For example, amorphous materials synthesized in RT with a higher carbon content,
    or a

    NW-structure have shown improved performance. Some examples include nanocrystalline

    Mg0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 for N2O, graphene−CeO2 for CO, MWCNTs/WO3 for SO2, In2O3 nanocubes,

    Ti3C2Tx MXene composites for methanol sensing, photoactivated MOS for NO2, CuFe2O4
    for

    ethanol, ZnSnO3 for H2S, and p-type Na0.44MnO2 nanoribbons for ethanol [128].

    ple to detect toxic amounts of NO2 is a chemiresistive gas sensor based on a polyethyleneimine

    (PEI)-functionalized SWCNTs thin film on a SiO2 substrate, with improved selectivity
    and sensi-

    tivity towards strong electron-rappeler atoms [166]. A repeatable response with
    a sensitivity of

    37% was observed for the modified SWCNTs compared to the bare ones in the studied
    concen-

    tration range. SnO2 NW-based stripe (1–100 µm stripes) chemoresistors grown through
    CVD on

    micro-hotplates for CO and NO2 detection with a gas response increase by a factor
    of 500 [167].

    Graphene-based sensors realized by drop-casting graphene-based nanomaterial solutions
    on

    silver interdigitated electrodes (7 mm × 13.4 mm overall area composed of 7 +
    7 digits with a

    width of 210 µm) were able to detect several gases (NH3, (CH3)2CO, C2H6O, (CH3)2CHOH),

    and NaOCl) in the ppb range [168]. Five different inks were each dispensed on
    top of the

    electrodes. These were a graphene dispersion (1 mg/mL in DMF), graphene nanoplatelet

    (1 mg/mL, water dispersion), Fe3O4/graphene nanocomposite (10 mg/mL acetone dispersion,

    Fe3O4 NPs size: 5–25 nm), CoPt/graphene nanocomposite (10 mg/mL acetone dispersion,

    CoPt NPs size: 2–5 nm), and TiO2/graphene nanocomposite (10 mg/mL, acetone dispersion,

    TiO2 NPs size: 10–40 nm). Principal component analysis of the sensor responses
    allows discrim-

    ination of the different gases, while linear discriminant analysis demonstrated
    the ability of the

    sensor array to recognize unknown data with a high accuracy.

    4.6. Self-Powered Triboelectric Gas Sensors

    Triboelectric nanogenerator-based (TENG) self-powered gas sensors have gained
    inter-

    est as they enable the development of portable gas sensors that do not require
    an external

    power source. These sensors require no maintenance and are able to be miniaturized

    and portable [169,170]. Self-powered active gas sensors function simultaneously
    as an

    energy source and sensor. The TENG-based self-powered wearable gas sensors response

    is due to changing the TENG output as the triboelectric charge density varies
    upon gas

    exposure [171]. Since triboelectricity involves temporary electrostatic charge,
    which is a

    common phenomenon in most materials, the use of various material options is possible.

    Triboelectricity is simply a friction-generated static electrical charge [172].
    Metal oxide

    semiconductors and conducting polymers are commonly used as sensing materials
    in the

    fabrication of TENGs [173].

    Self-powered high-performance MXene-based ﬂexible wearable sensors driven by

    triboelectric–electromagnetic nanogenerators are developed as multifunctional
    detection

    systems for gas and movement monitoring [174]. The Ti3C2Tx MXene/Ag-based TENGs

    fabricated by microelectronic printer and electrospinning devices performed successfully
    on

    the ﬁnger and knee with high selectivity to ethanol with a long-term stability
    up to 30 days.

    The sensor response to ethanol was also ~25 higher than that of chemiresistors
    [174].

    To obtain fully ﬂexible wearable gas-monitoring TENGs, a good combination of high

    performance and miniaturized circuits is required, which makes it challenging
    to develop

    with low power consumption in environmental gas measurements. To overcome this

    challenge, a wearable rechargeable and self-powered polyacrylamide hydrogel patch
    has

    recently been developed for remote wireless detection of NO2 with remarkable performance.

    With an ultrahigh selectivity and sensitivity in high humidity and at subzero
    temperatures,

    this sensor revealed outstanding performance (for sub-ppm) compared to existing
    self-

    powered NO2 sensors [175].

    Due to the importance of miniaturization in the development of self-powered gas

    sensors and in an effort to achieve real-time monitoring, an RT high-performance
    self-

    powered TENG sensor was developed for the detection of formaldehyde [176]. A surface

    modiﬁcation strategy was applied to exploit the functionalized triboelectric layer
    as the

    active sensing layer followed by incorporation of the seed layer of the Ag electrode.
    As the

    ﬁrst self-powered TENG-based formaldehyde sensor, superior selectivity, and ultra-fast

    response time of 5 s to a sub-ppm level were achieved, which are superior to those
    of

    state-of-the-art formaldehyde sensors [176]. In summary, the research on self-powered

    TENG sensors for environmental gas monitoring is still in its early stage, and
    the selection

    of sensing materials, device stability, device design, and other aspects offer
    signiﬁcant

    scope for new developments.

    5. Environmental Gaseous Pollutants Monitoring

    This section discusses several critical gaseous contaminants, highlighting their
    impor-

    tance and effect on humanity and the planet.

    5.1. Ammonia (NH3)

    NH3 is a dangerous gaseous chemical with serious health consequences. Exposure

    to excessive amounts of NH3 can result in life-threatening effects. It is an odorless,
    water-

    soluble, and poisonous gas that can pollute the environment and cause severe lung
    condi-

    tions [177]. It has a high solubility in water-rich environments and contact with
    its vapors

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    34 of 73

    causes acute irritation of the eyes, mucous membranes, and respiratory system.
    Despite the

    essential industrial role of NH3 in petrochemical, plastics, textiles, explosives,
    and nitric

    acid manufacture, it is one of the most hazardous gaseous pollutants. The USA
    National

    Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has deﬁned legal safety limits for
    NH3 expo-

    sure, with a concentration limit of 25 ppm for long-term exposure of 8 h and 35
    ppm for

    short-term exposure of 15 min. However, prolonged exposure to higher concentrations
    of

    NH3 gas can cause signiﬁcant injuries or even death [178]. Thus, it is vital to
    identify low

    levels of this gas by providing sensors with superior precision and performance,
    specif-

    ically in small dimensions for environmental purposes. Furthermore, NH3 is reported

    as a general marker in many illnesses (e.g., kidney failure), as well as an index
    for food

    quality monitoring (e.g., ﬁsh) since some bacteria produce it as part of their
    metabolic

    processes [179]. Various sensing approaches based on various nanomaterials have
    been

    proposed to detect NH3. Such examples have already been discussed in previous
    sections,

    and a few more examples are highlighted here. Another example is a chemiresistive
    RT

    graphene quantum dot-based gas sensor that has shown a quick response to NH3 with
    a

    linear concentration range of 10 to 500 ppm [180]. After chemisorption of oxygen
    species in

    the air on the surface of the OH-modiﬁed sensing ﬁlm, NH3 vapor molecules react
    with

    these oxygen species and transfer electrons to the n-type sensing surface. This
    electron

    transfer decreases the resistance by increasing the density of the electron carrier.
    Here,

    edge functionalization of graphene quantum dots with hydroxyl groups by drop casting

    improves the sensor’s performance with high selectivity to NH3 gas [180].

    Three-dimensional maze-like graphene nano-sheets with improved structure and

    thickness were prepared from two-dimensional graphene nanosheets by plasma-enhanced

    CVD and applied for the chemiresistive RT detection of NH3 gas. Due to H2 plasma

    etching, the surface area and the number of defect sites were enhanced, which
    led to an

    excellent performance of this platform with small-sized crystalline sensing nanomateri-

    als [181]. Trace amounts of NH3 gas (10 ppm) were also measured at 40 ◦C on a
    polyaniline

    nanoﬁber/SWCNT composite. Compared to pristine SWCNT-based sensors, higher re-

    peatability and long-term stability were observed for the chemiresistive sensor
    [182]. The

    importance of the functionalization of GO sheets in the sensing performance of
    NH3 sensors

    has also been investigated. Meta-toluic acid was modiﬁed on GO thin ﬁlms via esteriﬁca-

    tion, leading to a lower sensor resistance from RT to 600 ◦C than bare GO sheets.
    Sufﬁcient

    sensor response of 32.7% and a response time of 10 s were obtained for 100 ppm
    NH3

    gas [183]. The application of non-covalent functionalized pyrrole/phthalocyanine
    with

    MWCNTs has also been veriﬁed in ultrafast detection (11.7 s) of NH3 gas with a
    recovery

    time of 91.8 s. The improved chemiresistive sensing performance of the platform
    to 50 ppm

    NH3 gas at RT was ascribed to the synergistic optimization and recombination of
    pyrrole,

    phthalocyanine, and MWCNT [184]. The performance of ZnO-based chemiresistive sensors

    towards NH3 has been efﬁciently improved by MWCNT decoration compared to bare
    ZnO

    sensors. As the porous space between ZnO nanoparticles is ﬁlled with CNTs, the
    roughness

    of the available contact surface area for gas adsorption increases, consequently
    improving

    the sensor’s gas detection capability. High and stable selectivity and sensitivity
    of the

    sensor to NH3 in the presence of CH4 and CO were also veriﬁed at low concentrations

    of NH3 (10 and 20 ppm). The sensor architecture and sensing mechanism, as well
    as the

    experimental setup used, are illustrated in Figure 8. The sensor achieved a response
    of

    1.022, a response time of 13.687 s, and a recovery time of 107.109 s [185].

    Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy is well-known as a promising fast-

    response optical gas-sensing technique with sufﬁcient selectivity and sensitivity.
    In a

    recent survey, the effect of three different carbon-based nanosensing materials,
    including

    CNTs, GO, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), coated on a quartz tuning fork (i.e.,
    the

    detector of the system), was studied by measuring trace amounts of NH3 gas. This
    low-

    cost sensing device revealed the minimum LOD of 7.27 ppm for NH3 gas at optimized

    conditions for the rGO-coated sensor [186].

    As one of the best organic n-type semiconductors, non-toxic sulfur-containing
    C60

    fullerene derivatives have been applied as green gas-sensing materials in organic
    ﬁeld-effect

    transistors for NH3 detection. This rather sensitive device could respond to 1
    ppm NH3

    after a 7% increase in the source-drain current. The response and recovery time
    of the sensor

    were ~30 and 120 s, respectively. This simple, environmentally friendly approach
    can also be

    designed and developed to fabricate ﬂexible electrical circuits [187]. In a different
    approach,

    a sensor was made up of the organic semiconductor poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):

    poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS), electrochemically deposited iridium oxide
    particles

    (IrOx), and an agarose hydrogel sheet that aids the electrochemical sensing mechanism
    of

    the proposed device [188]. The working principle is based on the potentiometric
    response

    of IrOx, which is embedded within the organic semiconductor and responds to local
    pH

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    36 of 73

    variations in the hydrogel, modulating the doping state of the semiconductor.
    This is a

    signiﬁcant departure from the majority of current NH3 gas sensors. The hydrogel
    interface

    is the most critical aspect of the sensor construction for achieving a reversible
    and selective

    response. This is because it is here that the gaseous analyte dissolves and absorbs
    reversibly,

    causing pH shifts. Its composition, acid-base characteristics, and shape were
    all ﬁnely

    tuned to achieve self-healing properties, the desired porosity, substrate adherence,
    and

    humidity stability.

    Furthermore, the material’s self-healing characteristics were achieved by ﬁnely
    tuning

    the material’s acid–base properties. On a ﬂexible plastic foil, the PEDOT: PSS/IrOx/hydrogel

    sensor was successfully constructed and tested in a wearable conﬁguration with
    wireless

    communication to a smartphone. The sensor could be implemented on a ﬂexible plastic

    foil due to the dependability of the analytical response, the simple two-terminal
    structure,

    and the low power consumption of 0.1 mW. With a sensitivity of 60 ± 8 µA decade−1
    in a

    wide concentration range of 17–7899 ppm, the wearable sensor displayed robustness
    to

    mechanical deformations and good analytical results [188].

    5.2. Nitric Oxide (NO)

    One of the most hazardous gaseous pollutants is nitric oxide (NO). It contributes
    to

    acid rain deposition and participates in ozone layer depletion. It is formed by
    lightning

    in thunderstorms and combustion systems, such as car engines and various industrial

    processes. Exposure to even inﬁnitesimal concentrations (ppb-ppm) of NO can signiﬁcantly

    impact the environment and human health. NO is a colorless gas, and, along with
    CO,

    it is known as a silent killer and irritates the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.
    At the

    same time, it also increases the risks of respiratory and cardiopulmonary diseases
    [189,190].

    The USA Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has deﬁned a safety

    limit at the workplace of 25 ppm over an eight-hour workday; above this limit,
    it reduces

    the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Above 100 ppm, it becomes immediately

    dangerous. NO is a signaling molecule in several physiological and pathological
    processes

    in humans and other mammals. It can diffuse freely across cell membranes; it is,
    for exam-

    ple, a cardiovascular signaling molecule. It increases vasodilation and blood
    ﬂow while

    playing a strong role in angiogenesis. In almost all types of organisms, it is
    a byproduct. As

    a diagnostic biomarker, its measurement in exhaled breath can be exploited for
    diagnosing

    digestive diseases and inﬂammation in the stomach (gastritis, hepatitis, and colitis),
    liver

    transplant rejection, cystic ﬁbrosis, encephalopathy, helicobacter pylon digestive
    cancer,

    and respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
    and

    asthma [191]. Hence, converting NO into harmless nitrogen species through catalytic

    reactions has gained attention [192,193]. Therefore, the production and development
    of gas

    sensors has become a signiﬁcant concern for researchers and scientists. Carbon
    structures

    such as fullerene (C60), graphene, graphene nanoribbons, graphene quantum dots,
    and

    CNTs have been proposed for sensing CO, NO, and NH3 gases [194]. Although various
    al-

    lotropes of carbon, such as armchair graphene nanoribbons, zigzag graphene nanoribbons,

    graphene quantum dots, and graphene sheets, have promising capabilities concerning
    gas

    adsorption, similar to graphene and CNTs, it has been shown that functionalization
    of

    carbon allotropes (doping) with Sc, Ti, V, Cr, and Al remarkably improves their
    sensing

    ability [195]. In one such example, an SWNT-based gas sensor that operates at
    RT was

    proposed [191]. The SWCNTs were formed between Au electrodes and were functionalized

    with en-APTAS. A chemiresistive change of 28.64% with a 100-ppb concentration
    of NO

    gas was achieved, presenting no sensitivity to CO and VOCs. An SWCNT dispersion

    was spray-coated on a semiconductive wafer that was ﬁrst oxygen-plasma-treated
    and

    then coated with APTES. The device was then coated with en-APTAS and then washed

    in ethanol. Sputtering Au through a shadow mask enabled the patterning of interdigi-

    tated electrodes above the sensing ﬁlm. In a different study, graphitic carbon-doped
    SnO2

    nanosheet-wrapped tubes were proposed for chemiresistive ppb-level RT NO sensing
    [196].

    This approach enabled a response of 256.3 towards 1 ppm NO at 50 ◦C, a short recovery

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    37 of 73

    time of 42 s, an LOD of 50 ppb, and long-term stability. The chemiresistive sensing
    ﬁlm

    was manufactured using wooden hydrangea petals as a biotemplate.

    In another chemiresistive approach, iron oxide nanorods prepared by oxidizing
    a

    stainless-steel mesh by a wet oxidation technique were demonstrated [197]. This
    sensor

    operated at 250 ◦C, where, with a 1 mV applied voltage, NO sensing between 0.5
    ppm

    and 2.75 ppm was demonstrated. The device response was found to be between 1.49%

    for 0.5 ppm and 15.2% for 2.75 ppm, with a response and recovery time of less
    than 10 s.

    Another exciting approach involved pulsed laser ablation in a liquid environment
    and

    subsequent thermal annealing to synthesize CuO ligand-free nanoparticles [198].
    These

    were then drop-casted on an interdigitated electrode structure on an alumina substrate.

    The produced chemiresistive sensor demonstrated a fast (response time of 2.5 s,
    recovery

    time of 278 s) and selective NO sensor, with a sensitivity of 0.0044 R/Ro ppm−1
    and an

    LOD of 10 ppm, when operating at 50 ◦C.

    5.3. Nitrous Oxide (N2O)

    N2O is a toxic gas that ﬁnds widespread use in medicine, speciﬁcally in surgery
    and

    dentistry, due to its anesthetic and analgesic properties. It is commonly known
    as ‘laughing

    gas’ due to its euphoric effects upon inhaling it, which can cause slight hallucinations.

    As a result, it is also used as a recreational substance. Nevertheless, it is
    neurotoxic and

    can cause irreversible neurological damage, while it has also been associated
    with DNA

    damage. It is a non-ﬂammable and colorless gas with a sweet smell and taste; it
    is stable at

    RT and easy to store. At elevated temperatures, it is a powerful oxidizer, and
    it is thus used

    in motor racing and rockets as a propellant. It is also extensively used as a
    food additive as

    an aerosol spray propellant for cooking sprays and aerosol whipped cream. N2O
    is known

    to be a primary ozone scavenger in the stratosphere, contributing signiﬁcantly
    to global

    warming, especially since it is the third most important long-lived greenhouse
    gas. CO and

    N2O are critical greenhouse gases that play a crucial role in air pollution, with
    N2O being

    ~300 times more damaging and having a longer lifetime in the atmosphere than CO2
    [128].

    N2O is primarily generated in industrialized agriculture, animal farms, and through

    excessive use of synthetic fertilizers [199]. Its concentration in the atmosphere
    increases

    annually by approximately 1 ppb, and, in 2020, it reached a value of 333 ppb.
    About 40%

    of emissions between 2006 and 2016 are estimated to be due to human activity,
    primarily

    from emerging economies’ industrial and agricultural sectors. The above highlight
    the

    necessity for developing reliable methods to monitor N2O. Currently, N2O is analyzed

    using several methods, such as infrared laser spectroscopy using QCL, gas chromatography,

    (MEMS)-based approaches, NDIR adsorption, and chemiresistive and electrochemical

    methods (e.g., amperometry) [128]. Gas chromatography, however, requires the removal
    of

    moisture and particles and dilution steps that increase measurement uncertainty,
    making

    this approach unsuitable for real-time measurements of N2O [200]. There are several

    commercial NDIR N2O gas sensors. N2O has its highest IR active absorption wavelength

    at 4.5 µm, the lowest possible perturbation energy required to identify it. As
    a result,

    an LED can be used. Nevertheless, the absorption wavelengths of NO at 5.3 µm and

    CO at 4.3 µm lead to interference and overlap in the recorded spectra, thus leading
    to

    ambiguities in the measurement. In another optical approach, PAS has been combined
    with

    a 4.53 µm wavelength QCL to enhance its sensitivity and to achieve a minimum detection

    limit of 28 ppbv in 1 s and a measurement precision of 34 ppbv [201]. The performance

    was improved by humidifying the gas sample and reﬂecting the transmitted laser
    light

    back to the PAS cell. Kalman adaptive ﬁltering improved measurement precision
    by

    2.3 times without affecting the time resolution of the measurement. In a different
    approach,

    Zifarelli et al. achieved a minimum LOD of 6, 7, and 70 ppm at 100 ms of integration

    time for CO, N2O, and CO2, respectively, via the implementation of a quartz-enhanced

    photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) system [202].

    As discussed previously, electrochemical amperometric sensors require a polarization

    potential for reducing a target gas and measuring the resulting current related
    to its con-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    38 of 73

    centration. Different gases have different redox potentials, and, as mentioned
    before, O2

    and CO2 have less negative reduction potentials than N2O, while N2 has higher.
    More-

    over, N2O has a potential higher than that of dioxygen [200,203]. Consequently,
    various

    methods must be applied to improve speciﬁcity. Several of these were discussed
    earlier

    and included using multiple compartments where different reduction potentials
    are ap-

    plied or electrolytes that act as scavengers for the interferants. Different materials
    can be

    used for the sensing cathode of the electrochemical cell for N2O detection. These
    include

    silver and indium, the most common choice due to their catalytic activity toward
    N2O

    reduction. Other choices include palladium, tetraaminophthalocyanato cobalt (II),
    and

    metal porphyrins [128]. TCN (II)–KOH/rGO deposited by drop casting on carbon felt
    has

    demonstrated a capability of detecting N2O at different concentrations and increased
    gas

    ﬂow rate compared to the GC sensors [203]. The sensor achieved a wide sensing
    range from

    1 ppm to 16 ppm and an LOD of 1 ppm. The electrochemical cell was composed of
    a Pt

    counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode that was positioned within
    a 0.5 M

    H2SO4 solution. The carbon-felt-based working electrode was placed in a different
    chamber

    separated by a Naﬁon membrane where the gas was introduced. The above discussion

    considered direct detection of N2O; however, indirect detection through the reduction
    of

    O2 produced through the decomposition of N2O at temperatures between 500–700 ◦C
    is

    another approach [128]. This can be facilitated by using a solid-state electrolyte
    such as

    yttrium-stabilized zirconium, which is not a suitable approach for wearable applications

    due to the very high temperature required.

    5.4. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

    NO2 is a highly reactive gas and one of the most prevalent atmospheric gaseous

    pollutants, ranking second among the hazardous pollutants produced by automobiles.
    It is

    mainly produced by fossil fuel combustion, automobile exhaust, power plant emissions,

    and industrial activities. It is considered one of the most hazardous environmental
    and

    biological pollutants. It can cause severe respiratory problems, such as asthma,
    lung inﬂam-

    mation, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, even at short-term
    exposures

    and low (ppm) concentration levels. Some non-respiratory system problems caused
    by NO2

    exposure are diabetes, hypertension, and heart and cardiovascular diseases [204].
    It is also

    a threat towards animals, plants, and the environment, and also one of the primary
    factors

    producing photochemical pollution and acid rain [4]. Therefore, it is of utmost
    importance

    to develop high-performance gas sensors that can precisely monitor concentrations
    of NO2

    at the parts per billion (ppb) level. MOS gas sensors, such as those based on
    ZnO, SnO2,

    TiO2, In2O3, MoO3, and WO3, have garnered signiﬁcant attention for their low cost,
    high

    sensitivity, and abundance [205–208]. MOSs commonly requires elevated temperatures,

    which enable them to achieve considerable sensing performance. However, this also
    results

    in higher power consumption, making their use impractical for portable applications
    like

    wearable devices.

    On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) metal sulﬁdes have emerged as high-

    performance and power-saving materials for gas sensing but have received relatively
    little

    attention. However, doping of 2D metal sulﬁdes has been shown to enhance gas interaction

    properties, particularly at RT. For example, Cheng et al. synthesized three-dimensional

    (3D) micro-combs from 2D N-doped In2S3 via hydrothermal synthesis, resulting in
    an RT

    reversible NO2 gas sensor [209]. They have shown that N-doping signiﬁcantly enhances
    the

    electronic band structure of In2S3, which enables hybridization with NO2 molecular
    orbitals.

    In addition, gas sensors based on chemiresistive tin oxide (SnO2) have received
    widespread

    attention due to their high oxygen vacancies, intrinsic non-stoichiometry, broad
    bandgap,

    high charge carrier mobility, and high thermal and chemical stability [210]. However,
    their

    application, mainly in wearable devices, is restricted by elevated operating temperatures

    and high-power consumption [211,212]. Various strategies have been employed to
    address

    these issues, including doping, phase-controlled modiﬁcations, nanostructuring,
    and het-

    erojunctions with metals and metal oxides. For example, a low-temperature SnO2
    sensor

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    39 of 73

    has been developed by doping Ni into the SnO2 nanoparticle matrix, which yielded
    a high

    response at a low concentration level of 3 ppm NO2 at RT [213,214]. The utilization
    of dif-

    ferent dopants, such as Pd, has allowed low detection concentrations (0.35–5 ppm)
    of NO2

    at 100 ◦C. Additionally, researchers have demonstrated that doping SnO2 thin ﬁlms
    with

    rare earth elements (Y and Er) produces a considerable amount of oxygen vacancies
    that

    intensify the adsorption of NO2 molecules. This results in an enhanced response
    at a lower

    gas concentration while also resolving the requirement of high operating temperatures,

    thus reducing power consumption [211,215,216].

    5.5. Carbon Monoxide (CO)

    CO is one of six primary air pollutants the World Health Organization (WHO) iden-

    tiﬁed. CO is a colorless and odorless gas that is less dense than air. It is produced
    by

    the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, gas from automobiles, aeroplanes, natural
    gas

    emissions, coal mines, ﬁres, industrial waste, sewage leaks, solid fuel appliances,
    water

    heaters, open ﬂames, and other biological activities [217]. This pollutant harms
    all natural

    resources, including the air, water, earth, and all living organisms. Therefore,
    several

    attempts have been made to reduce and prevent exposure to harmful pollutants.
    As CO

    is an industrial-based chemical gas that is widely used in fuel production and
    other ap-

    plications, the WHO has set an exposure limit of 9 ppm for CO for 8 h. Mild exposure

    to CO can cause breathing problems, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue
    [218,219].

    However, more deadly symptoms are triggered when a person is exposed to a greater

    CO concentration [220]. When exposed to CO gas, CO molecules displace the oxygen
    in

    the body, leading to poisoning. CO rise in blood carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) is
    the best

    biomarker to characterize CO poisoning [221].

    On the other hand, the most probable direct cause of mortality is the buildup
    of

    CO in tissues. Apart from gas chromatography, there is no dependable technology
    that

    can accurately assess the amount of CO present in tissues. A synthetic supramolecular

    molecule called hemoCD1, consisting of an iron(II) porphyrin and a cyclodextrin
    dimer,

    was utilized as a reagent in a simple colorimetric test to measure the concentration
    of CO in

    biological samples [221]. The test was validated in various organ tissues obtained
    from rats

    under standard settings and after exposure to CO. The kinetic proﬁle of CO in
    blood and

    tissues after CO treatment revealed that CO buildup in tissues was avoided by
    circulating

    Hb, suggesting a protective function of Hb in CO intoxication. This ﬁnding was
    based

    on the kinetic proﬁle of CO in blood and tissues after CO treatment. According
    to the

    ﬁndings, the buildup of CO-Hb and CO in tissues in vivo is accelerated when CO
    gas is

    inhaled. Even while air or O2 ventilation can return CO-Hb levels to baseline
    levels, it is

    challenging to eliminate CO from tissues, particularly in the brain. This is especially
    the

    case for accumulation. Furthermore, scientists have demonstrated how the CO content
    in

    tissues reaches a plateau rapidly during CO exposure, despite CO-Hb levels in
    the blood

    continuing to increase over time. This ﬁnding raises signiﬁcant concerns regarding
    the role

    of Hb as a potential molecular shield that safeguards tissues from accumulating
    harmful

    levels of CO. The data on CO concentration in tissues and organs were obtained
    using a

    novel and simpliﬁed approach for CO detection based on hemoCD1, which was extensively

    examined and validated in the study [221].

    Many recent studies have focused on smart wearable devices that can be attached
    to the

    skin or injected into the body to monitor various parameters and provide quick
    detection.

    A cotton textile was obtained from a laboratory coat coated with graphene/ZnO
    in another

    study. These samples were cleaned using ultrasonication and dried before adhering
    to

    a glass microscope slide with adhesive polyimide tape. Graphene was deposited
    via

    dip coating. In the next phase, the graphene-coated textiles were modiﬁed with
    ZnO

    seed layers that were deposited using a solution-based technique. To make the
    ZnO seed

    solution, Zn(NO3)2.6H2O was dissolved in 2-propanol, and then triethylamine (C6H15N)

    was added as a sol stabilizer, and the reaction was completed. Using the chemical
    bath

    deposition (CBD) process, ZnO nanorods were generated on the ZnO-seeded graphene-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    40 of 73

    coated textiles [220]. This chemosresistive sensor was highly sensitive and selective
    at RT

    towards CO gas down to 10 ppm, with the shortest sensor response and recovery
    times

    achieved being 280 s and 45 s, respectively. When comparing graphene and graphene/ZnO

    sensors, a 40% enhancement in sensing response was achieved, supporting the superiority

    of the proposed hybrid material approach as a ﬂexible CO chemiresistive sensor.
    As

    discussed previously, FETs are also utilized for gas sensing. A FET sensor using
    a Zn-doped

    In2O3 single nanowire that can detect gas concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 ppm
    (CO, NO,

    and NO2) has been demonstrated [219]. The Zn-doped In2O3 FET sensor was found
    to be

    the most sensitive to CO gas when tested at ambient temperature. The sensing response
    at

    ambient temperature is linked to the development of defects in the nanowire and
    a change

    in its conductivity due to Zn doping. The performance of the Zn-doped In2O3 nanowire

    sensor was about three times better than that of the undoped nanowire sensor [219].
    In a

    different study, researchers reported a 20% improvement in the detection performance
    of

    CO when operating a SnO2 NW chemiresistive gas sensor at 103 ◦C [222]. This was
    achieved

    by using a wireless microheater that was optimized through the appropriate design
    of its

    resistive heating element and inductive antenna. The optimal sensing temperature
    varied

    depending on the type of gas [222].

    5.6. Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

    All aerobic organisms release CO2 as a waste product when they metabolize organic

    compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is also released from organic
    materials

    when they decay or combust (e.g., forest ﬁres or by humans for heating and other
    purposes).

    On the other hand, CO2 is utilized by plants as part of their metabolism for photosynthesis,

    releasing O2. Consequently, CO2 is necessary for the survival of life on earth.
    CO2 is

    also released into the environment from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels
    (such as

    coal, oil, and natural gas) and natural processes like volcanic eruptions. Other
    signiﬁcant

    anthropogenic sources include biomass burning, deforestation, and cement production.

    Transportation, industry, and agriculture are the primary sources of air pollution
    in cities.

    As of May 2022, the global average concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is 421
    ppm.

    Compared to 280 ppm before the mid-18th century, this is an increase of 50% since
    the

    start of the Industrial Revolution [31]. This is well above the threshold of 350
    ppm required

    to prevent irreversible climate change. This increase is due to human activity,
    mainly

    due to the burning of fossil fuels. In addition, CO2 absorbs and emits infrared
    radiation.

    As a result, it plays a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing Earth’s surface temperature
    through

    the greenhouse effect, making CO2 a major contributor to global climate change.
    This

    phenomenon has been linked to an increase in severe weather conditions, such as
    storms,

    droughts, and wildﬁres worldwide [223].

    CO2 is a colorless, odourless greenhouse gas [224]. It is an asphyxiant gas and
    not

    classiﬁed as toxic or harmful. Nevertheless, high levels of CO2 can have a signiﬁcant

    impact on human health, causing everything from tiredness and loss of concentration

    (100–2000 ppm), drowsiness and a stuffy lung feeling (10,000 ppm), to death (>40,000
    ppm),

    with concentrations of 70,000 to 100,000 ppm causing suffocation, even in the
    presence

    of sufﬁcient oxygen. This initially manifests as dizziness, headache, visual and
    hearing

    dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour. As a result,
    detecting

    CO2 gas is crucial. More efﬁcient building insulation can minimize the consequences
    of

    climate change, but over-insulated buildings may not be healthy. Poor ventilation
    can lead

    to low oxygen levels and a build-up of CO2. Even low levels of CO2 can severely
    impact

    health and productivity. There is, thus, an increasing demand for miniaturized
    and precise

    gas sensors that can be effectively employed in large-scale sensor networks to
    monitor

    greenhouse gas concentration patterns. These sensors must be capable of monitoring

    ﬂuctuations in greenhouse gas concentrations [225]. As a result, manufacturers
    of CO2

    sensor modules are seeing a rise in demand for smart indoor air quality monitors
    that

    can detect rising CO2 levels and inform the user or trigger a system reaction.
    Wearable

    CO2 sensors in smart homes and workplaces enable precise measurement of CO2 levels.
    A

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    41 of 73

    recent study took advantage of the widespread use of facemasks for combating the
    spread

    of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus that caused
    the

    COVID-19 disease. A ﬁltered face mask FFP2 has a dead space volume (DSV), the
    volume

    of non-exchanged gas between O2 and CO2. A batteryless wearable mask was proposed
    to

    determine CO2 concentration. Wearing facemasks makes breathing more challenging
    and

    increases DSV, resulting in higher CO2 levels. A sensing system was placed into
    a FFP2

    mask to determine the amount of CO2 gas indoors. This opto-chemical sensor could
    detect

    a concentration of CO2 of 140 ppm with a response time below 1 s. The sensor had
    an 8 h

    operational time and could be operated by an application downloaded on a smartphone,

    as shown in Figure 9 [226].

     

    can severely impact health and productivity. There is, thus, an increasing demand for 

    miniaturized and precise gas sensors that can be eﬀectively employed in large-scale sensor 

    networks  to  monitor  greenhouse  gas  concentration  patterns.  These  sensors 
    must  be 

    capable of monitoring ﬂuctuations in greenhouse gas concentrations [225]. As a result, 

    manufacturers of CO2 sensor modules are seeing a rise in demand for smart indoor air 

    quality monitors that can detect rising CO2 levels and inform the user or trigger a system 

    reaction.  Wearable  CO2  sensors  in  smart  homes  and  workplaces  enable

    Since the increasing concentration of CO2 contributes to the greenhouse gas effect,
    it

    leads to a temperature increase in the environment. CO2 also causes metal corrosion
    and de-

    creases the heating value of methane (CH4) when combined with water in the atmosphere.

    In another study, researchers proposed using metamaterials to detect dangerous
    levels of

    gases. Metamaterials are artiﬁcially made structures with permittivity and permeability

    properties not found in naturally occurring materials. They have generated signiﬁcant

    interest due to their impressive electromagnetic (EM) response. Constructing metamaterials

    enables us to alter the electromagnetic characteristics of materials to achieve
    more favor-

    able optical properties. In recent years, researchers have conducted extensive
    studies on

    metamaterial-based electromagnetic (EM) absorbers that are promising for sensing
    applica-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    42 of 73

    tions [227]. One such metamaterial-based gas sensor was proposed for CO2 sensing
    [225].

    A photonic CO2 gas sensor, based on infrared evanescent ﬁeld absorption, could
    detect gas

    concentrations as low as 5000 ppm. Symptoms such as headaches, drowsiness, a lack
    of

    focus, a slightly elevated heart rate, and slight nausea may occur at this level.
    A desirable

    conﬁguration for a metasurface can be achieved by depositing a periodic array
    of silicon

    nano-cylindrical meta-atoms (MAs) on a metal layer (Au). This arrangement offers
    the

    opportunity to function as a perfect narrowband absorber.

    Moreover, the metasurface can operate as a gas sensor if a speciﬁc thin layer
    of a

    functional host material is deposited on its surface. Depositing a functional
    host material

    allowed researchers to investigate the gas-sensing capabilities of the metasurface-based

    absorber. To detect CO2 gas, a polymer called Poly hexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)

    was utilized [225]. This polymer can absorb CO2 gas. When CO2 molecules bind with
    the

    PHMB layer, it alters the polarizability of the layer, leading to a change in
    its refractive

    index. The functionalization layers’ refractive index is affected by variations
    in CO2

    gas concentration in the surrounding environment. This change can be explained
    by a

    redistribution of electron density of the polymer repeating units resulting from
    the CO2

    molecules’ binding. The proposed gas sensor has a maximum sensitivity of 17.3
    pm/ppm

    and can detect CO2 gas concentrations ranging from 0 to 524 ppm. The described
    sensor

    architecture has the potential to identify other harmful gases by utilizing suitable
    functional

    host materials [225]. In another recent study, researchers worked on a transcutaneous
    blood

    gas analysis (non-invasive) method for health monitoring. COVID-19, sleep apnea,
    and

    COPD will be revolutionized by a small wearable device that can continuously monitor

    transcutaneous blood oxygen and CO2 [228]. A wearable wristband device that utilized

    a tiny nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor to continuously and non-invasively
    monitor

    transcutaneous blood CO2 was proposed.

    Additionally, a hydrophobic layer with high CO2 permeability was created to reduce

    the interference caused by humidity on the NDIR CO2 sensor’s functionality. This
    NDIR

    sensor demonstrated a linear and precise response and low power consumption. As
    blood

    gas is humidiﬁed and water is released from the body through sweat or diffusion,
    this

    solution provides a low-cost and non-heating method for measuring transcutaneous
    CO2

    on a wearable platform [228].

    5.7. Hydrogen Sulﬁde (H2S)

    H2S is a colorless, poisonous, highly ﬂammable, corrosive, and toxic gas that
    is

    produced during the processing and breakdown of organic materials, e.g., from
    bacteria and

    industrial production activities related to fossil fuels, natural gas and petroleum
    production,

    and reﬁneries. It inhibits cellular respiration and can rapidly damage the organs,
    and cause

    convolutions, breathing difﬁculties, and even death, affecting the nervous system.
    At

    low levels (~10 ppm), it causes eye irritation, nausea, cough, shortness of breath,
    fatigue,

    dizziness, and headache over time; 50–100 ppm can lead to eye damage. Consequently,

    it is classiﬁed as a hazardous air pollutant as it causes adverse health effects,
    making it a

    dangerous gas.

    Moreover, the odor of H2S diminishes beyond 100 ppm, which is considered a poten-

    tially fatal concentration, due to damage in the olfactory nerve [97,229,230].
    An amount

    above 320 ppm leads to pulmonary oedema, and 530 ppm leads to strong nervous system

    stimulation and potential loss of breathing. In contrast, 5 min exposure to 800
    ppm is lethal

    for half the population. At the same time, H2S is a signaling molecule and a mediator
    for

    several disease states and healthy physiological processes. For example, overproduction
    of

    H2S is related to cancer and Down syndrome, while underproduction is associated
    with

    vascular disease. Thus, a sensing solution for rapidly detecting low H2S concentrations

    is required. Commercially available solutions typically provide an alarm to the
    user at

    5–10 ppm and a second alarm at 15 ppm.

    Electrospun nanoﬁbers offer several advantages, such as rapid and effortless pro-

    duction, a highly scalable process, and lightweight materials with a large surface
    area.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    43 of 73

    In a recent study focused on detecting H2S, the creation of ﬂexible capacitive
    sensors

    via electrospinning was demonstrated using a zirconium-based metal-organic framework

    (MOF) called NO2-UiO-66 [229]. Researchers developed a three-step process to create
    an

    electrode using electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the sensing layer coated
    with CNTs

    on both sides. Triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) was utilized to ensure the even dispersion
    of

    NO2-UiO-66 on PAN nanoﬁbers and to slow the crystallization process. This step
    is critical

    to enhancing the material’s adsorption capacity. CNTs were chosen as the electrode
    due to

    their high conductivity and air permeation properties. CNTs also offer additional
    ﬂexibility

    to the electrospun ﬁber, making it the ideal electrode for a wearable sensor.
    The designed

    electrospun sensor could detect H2S, even at an ultralow LOD of 10 ppb, and is
    suitable for

    use between 0 ◦C and 180 ◦C. Additionally, it demonstrated high reproducibility,
    even after

    one month of folding. These properties suggest that the designed material is promising
    for

    use in environments requiring sensitive and precise detection with wearable sensors,
    such

    as gas masks [229].

    Another approach to H2S detection was taken by printing disposable sensor labels

    for colorimetric detection, among other air pollutants such as ammonia and formalde-

    hyde [230]. The concept relies on detecting air pollutants through a color change,
    observ-

    able using either a smartphone camera or a stationary reader. The sensor is constructed
    of

    a low-cost combination of plastic and paper, with a gas-sensitive layer containing
    a copper

    (II) complex of the azo dye 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol (H-PAN) (Cu-PAN). Detection
    of

    H2S occurs when S-2 reacts with the Cu-PAN complex, causing the color to change
    from

    purple to red, then yellow. Although the color change is reversible, the sensor
    will return

    to its initial purple state if the pollutant is not within the detectable range.
    However, the

    reverse reaction of the chelation of H-PAN with CuS is slower than the forward
    reaction.

    What sets this single-use printed pollutant sensor apart is its ability to overcome
    long-term

    stability issues typically encountered with similar sensors. In another paper,
    researchers

    demonstrated a sensor that utilizes Quick Response (QR) code technology to enable
    the

    easy identiﬁcation of pollutants by the user. The slow reverse reaction of the
    sensing

    material also makes it suitable for dosimeter applications. This product can be
    utilized

    in a variety of industries, including but not limited to mining and crude oil,
    due to its

    use of low-cost and easily obtainable paper–plastic composites [230] (Figure 10a).
    More

    recently, an Ag nanoﬁlm was used as a chemiresistive sensing ﬁlm, exploiting the
    fact

    that, upon exposure to H2S, Ag loses electrons and converts into Ag2S [231]. The
    applied

    temperature and the H2S concentration deﬁne the speed of this reaction. A temperature

    sensor was patterned next to the gas sensor. The device was operated at 300 ◦C,
    achieved

    an LOD of 1.4 ppm, and consumed 90 mW of power. At the same time, it demonstrated

    high selectivity towards H2S and a long-term stability of 28 days when exposed
    to 100 ppm.

    At an applied temperature of ~520 ◦C, the sensor can be recovered; otherwise,
    the authors

    estimated that the sensors can be used 533 times before it is exhausted.

    5.8. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)

    SO2 is a dangerous toxic pollutant produced by burning fossil fuels in places
    such

    as oil reﬁneries, power stations, and industrial plants. It is also generated
    from volcanic

    eruptions and forest ﬁres. It is a widely used food preservative, particularly
    with dried

    fruit, due to its antimicrobial properties and aptitude to prevent oxidation.
    It is extensively

    used in winemaking as an antibiotic and antioxidant since it protects wine from
    bacteria,

    and oxidation can spoil it. It is widely used for chlorinated wastewater treatment.
    It

    can be found in small concentrations in the atmosphere, in the region of 15 ppb.
    It is

    one of the six air pollutants monitored in the US, with a limit of 75 ppb for
    one hour of

    exposure. Endogenous SO2 is essential in regulating cardiac and blood vessel function,
    and

    its deﬁcient metabolism can lead to cardiovascular problems. Overexposure to SO2
    can

    cause severe health problems in the eyes, lungs, and throat. This pollutant harms
    human

    health, due to its high solubility in water.

    SO2 molecules can accumulate in rivers, soil, and clouds, resulting in acid rain.
    Acid

    rain disrupts the natural balance of wildlife and can damage building materials,
    such as

    limestone, ecosystem stability, and agricultural production [232]. These adverse
    effects of

    SO2 have stimulated research in developing sensitive, low-cost, and wearable sensors.

    One study on SO2 detection demonstrated an electrospun wearable and capacitive
    sen-

    sor with high efﬁciency and ﬂexibility [233]. Researchers combined electrospun
    polyvinyli-

    dene ﬂuoride (PVDF) with a zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66-NH2). The manufactured
    SO2

    capacitive sensors achieved detection within an extensive range, from 1 ppm to
    150 ppm at

    RT. The azanide group (NH2-) is essential in this work. Azanide can be used as
    a surface

    functionalization group and convert UiO-66 into a chemically resistant sensor.

    A study on the preparation and performance of SO2 sensors based on MOF-manufactured

    flexible sensors focused on the mechanical properties of the sensor [234]. The
    technology

    behind this sensor is similar to the previously discussed SO2 sensor [233]. The
    substrate

    was polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and the sensor was based on MOF-5. PVA was loaded
    with

    MOF-5 crystals previously modiﬁed with azanide groups via electrostatic spinning.
    The

    resulting sensor was low-cost and showed ﬂuorescent activity upon detection of
    SO2. The

    lightweight and ﬂexibility of the ﬁnal device allowed mobility and ﬂexibility,
    which are the

    most critical requirements for wearable sensors. Although it is easy to carry,
    the material

    shows a tensile strength of 1.42 MPa. Moreover, it has been revealed that decreasing

    the ﬁber diameter enhances the thermal stability of the sensor, making it suitable
    for

    use across a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, PVA nanoﬁbers are convertible,

    and the sensor’s ﬂuorescent probe can be substituted with other sensor types.
    These

    material properties could broaden the sensor’s applications beyond SO2 sensing
    [233]

    (Figure 10b). In another study, an RT UV-light-assisted chemiresistive SO2 gas
    sensor based

    on PANI and Ag nanoparticle-commodiﬁed tin dioxide nanostructures (Ag/PANI/SnO2)

    was presented [235]. When exposed to 50 ppm of the target gas, the sensor exhibited
    a

    response of 20.1, a response time of 110 s, and a recovery time of 100 s; the
    latter was

    achieved due to the UV irradiation (365 nm).

    5.9. Ozone (O3)

    Ozone formation in the troposphere occurs through a reaction between nitrogen
    oxides

    and volatile organic compounds released into the atmosphere by solar radiation.
    Ozone has

    a negative impact on human health, as it can cause respiratory and cardiovascular
    diseases

    and can affect the central nervous system. Ozone pollution in urban areas is related
    to

    heat-related mortality during heat waves. Moreover, exposure to even low ozone
    levels,

    below those currently regulated, can have chemical and toxicological effects due
    to its

    potent oxidative properties, leading to cellular-level oxidative damage. Above
    0.1 ppm,

    it causes damage to mucous and respiratory tissues in animals and in plant tissue.
    As

    speciﬁed by the WHO, 50 ppb is the O3 exposure threshold for 8 h [236]. At the
    same

    time, it also interferes with photosynthesis, affecting the growth of certain
    plant species.

    These detrimental effects of ozone have prompted research into its rapid and accurate

    detection, even at very low concentrations. In 2020, the USA Environmental Protection

    Agency (EPA) established the safe limit for ozone exposure at 0.09 ppm/h. In addition
    to

    its harmful impacts, ozone is also utilized for disinfecting medical environments
    owing

    to its oxidative properties. At high altitudes and in the so-called ozone layer,
    its high

    concentrations in the range of 2–8 ppm protect life on Earth by preventing dangerous
    and

    damaging UV irradiation from reaching the planet’s surface. It is important to
    note that

    catalytic decomposition with solid catalysts can be achieved with noble metals,
    such as

    Pt, Rh, or Pd and transition metals, including Mn, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, or Ag. Alternatively,
    it

    can be decomposed with heat (a prolonged process below 250 ◦C) or under UV irradiation.

    However, given the potential toxicity of ozone in public spaces, there is a need
    for portable

    sensors to detect its presence [237,238].

    Researchers have developed an ozone sensor utilizing a UV sensor [239]. The devel-

    oped sensor uses an aluminum-coated substrate-integrated hollow waveguide (iHWG)

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    45 of 73

    and a portable spectrophotometer for real-time ozone monitoring. The signiﬁcance
    of this

    study lies in the noteworthy reduction in the size of ozone sensor technology.
    As previously

    discussed, even ozone gas below the maximum level set by regulatory agencies can
    have

    adverse effects. The developed sensor could detect ozone at levels as low as 29
    ppb. A

    mercury lamp was used to detect ozone because of its strong emission in the UV-C
    range

    and narrow absorption at 254 nm (i.e., the absorbance range of ozone). By reducing
    the

    cost and size of ozone sensors, this work opens the door for smaller, more cost-effective

    ozone sensors with higher efﬁciency and greater accuracy, even at lower ozone
    levels [239].

    In a different study, a CuCo2O4 nanomaterial based O3 chemiresistive sensor operating
    at

    90 ◦C was proposed, achieving a response to 1 ppm of 11 at a RH of 0%, which increases

    with increasing RH (e.g., 24 and 27 for RH 50% and 70%, respectively) [237].

    5.10. Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)

    Hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) is widely utilized in various industries, such as electronics

    manufacturing and metal cleaning, as well as in the production of various pharmaceuticals

    and other chemicals, such as ﬂuoropolymers, chloroﬂuorocarbons, aluminum ﬂuorides,

    and petrochemicals. Additionally, it is employed as a rust removal and car washing
    agent

    for domestic use. With a pH level of approximately 5.5, HF is classiﬁed as a weak
    acid that

    can dissolve lipids. Its signiﬁcant solubility in lipids enables it to swiftly
    penetrate tissues

    when contacted or inhaled, resulting in poisoning upon ingestion, skin burns,
    and blindness

    by rapid destruction of the cornea. Exposure to it necessitates immediate medical
    attention.

    In severe cases, prolonged exposure to HF can cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia

    due to its afﬁnity for calcium and magnesium in the body.

    In contrast, it can cause death due to irregular heart rates or pulmonary oedema
    [240].

    Due to the toxic properties of HF mentioned above, regulating, and detecting its
    presence

    is crucial. OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit for HF at 3 ppm, with
    a short-

    term exposure limit of 6 ppm. However, exposure to HF would quickly exceed these

    established limits in case of a leak or spill. For example, the thermal decomposition
    of

    hydroﬂuorocarbon (HFC)-based ﬁre extinguishers and lithium-ion battery ﬁres can
    result

    in high levels of HF exposure. In such cases, the rapid production of HF from
    HFC-

    based ﬁre extinguisher decomposition can exceed the limits set by OSHA by a signiﬁcant

    amount [240]. In 2021, researchers developed a robust and intelligent fabric surface
    that

    can visually sense HF in a scalable manner. The study introduced a smart cotton
    fabric

    that was functionalized with maleimide-based copolymers. The detection of HF was

    achieved through the chromatic capability of the acid/base switch. The visual
    color change

    occurred within tens of seconds and was induced by protonation and deprotonation
    of

    the maleimide in the copolymers due to acid/base reactions. This study’s signiﬁcance

    lies in the prepared surfaces’ superhydrophobic nature, excellent antifouling
    properties,

    and mechanical and chemical stability. Such a material would demonstrate exceptional

    durability under harsh weather conditions, expanding its range of applications.
    Moreover,

    smart fabrics hold immense potential in detecting acid/base gases. The utilization
    of

    as-fabricated materials and the simple technology strategy pave the way for cost-effective

    and high-capacity monitoring systems [241]. An optical sensor for HF detection
    based

    on a microstructured-core photonic crystal ﬁber was recently proposed. The device
    was

    optimized computationally to achieve a wavelength of 1.33 µm, a relative sensitivity
    for

    the absorption lines of CH4 and HF gases of 44.47% [242].

    5.11. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

    VOCs are chemicals with a relatively high vapor pressure at RT and atmospheric

    pressure. VOCs are a complex and difﬁcult-to-detect group of substances. This
    category

    encompasses alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic hydrocarbons, non-methane hydrocarbons

    (NMHCs), oxygenated organic compounds, halogenated hydrocarbons, and organic com-

    pounds that contain sulfur and nitrogen. Most VOCs are hazardous, possess strong
    odors,

    and can harm human health and the environment. They can cause a wide range of
    versatile

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    46 of 73

    respiratory, immune, and allergic effects, among other issues, such as liver,
    central nervous

    system and kidney damage, loss of co-ordination, nausea, headaches, irritation
    to the throat,

    eyes and nose, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, fatigue, vomiting, visual disorders,
    memory

    impairment, and nose bleeds. In addition, their presence can affect the air quality
    inside

    and outside buildings; their indoor concentration can be two to ﬁve times greater
    than

    outdoors, or even thousands of times more when speciﬁc activities occur indoors
    [243].

    These compounds can originate from various sources, including natural processes
    and

    human activities. However, they are mainly generated through manufacturing processes
    in

    the energy industries, fossil fuel production and use (through their incomplete
    combustion

    or evaporation), and the use of solvents in paints, inks, and coatings, which
    are crucial

    components in the production of ash and photochemical haze [9]. Other sources
    include

    compressed aerosol products, biofuels, cooking oils, bioethanol, and incomplete
    biomass

    combustion. Hydrocarbons (CxHy) are a type of gaseous pollutant that is commonly
    asso-

    ciated with trafﬁc pollution. It is worth noting that VOCs are prone to undergo
    chemical

    reactions that can lead to the generation of toxic gases like NO2, which can contribute
    to air

    pollution [244,245].

    Nevertheless, they play an essential role in communicating with animals and plants.

    Consequently, VOC sensors are crucial in the oil industry, food and agriculture,
    health-

    care, safety, environmental monitoring, and other ﬁelds [246]. Therefore, wearable
    VOC

    electrical, optical, and gravimetric sensors are gaining increasing scientiﬁc
    and techno-

    logical attention. Recently, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and 2D TMDCs (such as WSe2) were

    combined to create a chemiresistive sensor that selectively detects oxygen-based
    VOCs.

    The Ti3C2Tx/WSe2 hybrid sensor was found to have a reduced noise level, quick
    response

    and recovery times, and high adaptability for a wide range of VOCs. In addition,
    the

    sensitivity of the hybrid sensor to ethanol was increased by over 12 times, which
    is a signif-

    icant improvement compared to unmodiﬁed Ti3C2Tx. Inkjet printing was used to deposit

    the hybrid gas-sensing membrane on a polyimide substrate with an Au-interdigitated

    electrode structure composed of six pairs of ﬁngers with an active electrode area
    of 8 mm

    × 8 mm, allowing measurements to determine the concentration of ethanol gas between
    1

    to 40 ppm [247].

    A prototype for a wearable VOC sensor was designed and demonstrated based on

    the synergistic effect of mechanochromic–vapochromic luminescence [244]. The synthe-

    sis pathway was developed based on crystal analysis and emissions from molecules
    in

    crystalline states. These molecules adopt a planar conformation and avoid π–π
    stacking

    through side-inserted molecules. Additionally, the mechanical structure of these
    crystals

    forces the molecules into coupled π-dimers to quench the light emission. However,
    upon

    detection of VOC, intermolecular interactions are rebuilt, and π-dimers are isolated,
    giving

    light emission an advantage. Such a molecular-level design allows for VOC detection
    at

    the ppm level.

    In summary, a solid-supported sensor and wearable device were presented that lever-

    age the principle of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecular systems. The
    AIE of

    choice was (E)-1-(((4-acetylphenyl)iminio)methyl) naphthalen-2-olate (AINO), which
    en-

    ables high emission in aggregated states, enabling the detection of VOCs in the
    atmosphere.

    The outstanding feature of this design is its easy encapsulation into clothing
    and gloves, as

    the sensor is fabricated on cellulose, making it suitable for daily use [244]
    (Figure 10c).

    Research focusing on personalized environmental quality monitoring developed a

    wearable sensor to detect several factors, including VOC and NO2, light quality,
    and

    acoustic and thermal comfort [245]. The sensor has been integrated into a wristband,
    which

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    48 of 73

    uses Bluetooth to transmit information to a smartphone, to quickly detect, monitor,
    and

    display results to users via a mobile application. The hardware was enclosed in
    a 3D-printed

    cage-like casing. This technology holds great promise for the future, with a user-friendly

    interface directly targeted at end-users [245]. Phthalocyanine (Pc)-functionalized
    graphene

    chemiresistors have also been proposed. A graphene sensor array was implemented
    by

    developing sensors functionalized with different amounts of metal-free phthalocyanine

    and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) [248]. The characteristic response pattern of
    each

    device for speciﬁc analytes was different, allowing the detection and differentiation
    of

    different VOCs (acetone, ethanol, formaldehyde, and toluene). LODs in the low
    ppm range

    were achieved. In another chemiresistive example, laser-patterned porous carbon/ZnO

    nanostructure composite inks were created on ﬂexible PET substrates to detect
    acetone

    and toluene [249]. Laser carbonization allowed the in-situ formation of ZnO nanoparticles

    from the Zn(NO3)2 contained in ink also composed from a citric acid/urea-based
    carbon

    network. Optimizing the initial Zn(NO3)2 concentration allowed for porosity and
    polarity

    tuning. At a concentration of 5 wt% Zn, the response toward acetone was increased
    (−21.5%

    response at 2.5% acetone), which is attributed to a signiﬁcantly higher porosity.
    When using

    pre-synthesized ZnO nanorods as additives, a relatively high selectivity toward
    toluene

    (−0.8% response at 0.4% toluene) was accomplished.

    A summary of what has been discussed thus far on different gaseous pollutants

    detected by nano-based wearable gas sensors is provided in Table 1.

    6. Challenges in Optimization of Sensor Performance

    6.1. Circuit Integration and Miniaturization

    A critical part of a sensing system is the electronic instrumentation used to
    interrogate

    and control a sensor. Dedicated circuitry also has the capability of addressing
    shortcomings

    that sensors may have. For example, they can provide averaging, ﬁltering, and
    computa-

    tional functions to improve sensor signal quality and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR),
    remove

    offsets, provide stable biasing conditions, or extract the necessary information.
    Conse-

    quently, electronic instrumentation can enhance and optimize sensor performance.
    Using

    generic off-the-shelf commercially available electronic components, while convenient
    and

    relatively easy with fast production and prototyping cycles, will lead to sizeable
    overall

    device size and power consumption (discussed in more detail below). The reason
    is that

    these are generic chips designed to address many applications and are, thus, not
    optimized

    for a particular application in mind. At the same time, microchips containing
    all neces-

    sary functions will typically be unavailable. In addition, within academic research,
    the

    novelty and innovation in developing electronic systems using off-the-shelf commercial

    components are very low. To enhance overall system integration, provide additional
    func-

    tionalities, minimize power consumption, and potentially improve speed and bandwidth,

    the development of custom application-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs) using
    advanced

    deep sub-micron CMOS technologies is required. Doing so also allows the realization
    of

    complete systems-on-chip (SoC) implementations. Mixed signal circuit design is,
    thus,

    essential, while the implementation of most processing and computation tasks,
    where

    possible, should be performed in the analogue domain. The solid-state circuit
    system

    communities have played a pivotal role in these developments. It is clear from
    the above

    discussions that ASIC development is the only way forward, especially for wearable
    appli-

    cations, where power consumption and system size are crucial. Packaging and bonding

    technologies are essential for integrating ASICs into ﬂexible, stretchable wearable
    devices.

    ASICs are relatively thick and rigid, based on traditional silicon technologies.
    Thinning the

    silicon chips to make them somewhat ﬂexible and easier to integrate with thin-ﬁlm
    ﬂexible

    and stretchable devices is, thus, attracting interest in creating a hybrid technology
    [250–252].

    Greater miniaturization and integration can be achieved if the sensors and electronics
    are

    on the same substrate and exploit the ASIC manufacturing and design processes
    to realize

    sensors. This may solve many issues related to the packaging and bonding of the
    ASIC to

    the sensing device, as they are now the same device [150,154].

    In the coming years, edge computing and on-node sensing information processing

    will play a critical role in wearable sensor nodes, networks, and the IoT. Neuromorphic
    and

    in-memory computing (memristive, spintronic, and phase-change) technologies, especially

    where analogue processing dominates, are expected to lead these developments,
    allowing

    for ultra-low power consumption and high integration and miniaturization [253–255].

    These developments will be helpful for wearable sensors and autonomous robotic
    systems

    that are sensor-enabled. Statistical processing and machine-learning approaches
    are already

    being implemented in sensing applications [256], and their implementation on silicon
    is

    the next step toward miniaturized intelligent wearable sensing nodes. Complex
    algorithms

    running on relatively large and power-hungry devices are expected to be realized
    in much

    smaller, more energy-efﬁcient devices. Such approaches will further enhance decision

    support and readout integrity by applying advanced computation methods on the
    sensing

    node and in real time to analyze noisy sensor signals and perform data fusion
    (e.g., Kalman

    ﬁlters) [257].

    With miniaturization and integration, chemiresistive micro-hotplate devices have

    attracted signiﬁcant interest. Miniaturization of the sensing element and hotplate
    reduces

    power consumption (from 100 s of mW to tens of mWs). Implementing these on CMOS

    allows the co-integration of the sensor with the required analogue and digital
    electronics

    using established technologies and the microelectronics industry’s related economies
    for

    scale and scope [258]. This high miniaturization and co-integration also allow
    large arrays

    of miniaturized sensors on the same substrate. Challenges are related to the post-processing

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    53 of 73

    of the CMOS die to enable the realization of the hotplates (e.g., front etching
    techniques

    to achieve a suspended membrane or back etching for a closed membrane) and also
    the

    deposition of the gas-sensitive material on the CMOS die, as these are typically
    CMOS-

    process-incompatible materials. Thus, care must be taken during the post-processing
    steps

    to ensure that the sensor readout and control electronics are not damaged [259].

    6.2. Real-Time Sensing

    One of the main challenges of sensors is conducting real-time measurements. For

    real-time monitoring, many strategies have been created and introduced. Meanwhile,

    due to their growing importance in the industry 4.0 revolution, wireless sensor
    networks

    (WSNs) and IoT-based systems are the most prominent technologies created for indoor

    air quality monitoring (IAQ) [260]. Machine-learning solutions can empower real-time

    IAQ monitoring. This is further enabled via their low-power and computationally
    efﬁcient

    implementation into new-generation microprocessors for edge computing through
    the rise

    of mobile devices and platforms, the IoT and big data analytics, and cloud computing,

    where computation can occur remotely. Air quality may now be readily monitored
    and

    regulated in real time due to the emergence of IoT-based handheld IAQ-monitoring
    devices.

    Real-time sensing is also crucial for ﬁreﬁghters and factory workers involved
    in industrial

    safety processes. A smart ﬁre detector, for example, should respond before smoke
    appears

    and warn whether chemicals are about to burn. Real-time smart gas monitoring meets

    the difﬁculty of computational time and data transfer, necessitating the collecting
    of sufﬁ-

    cient gas data from each sensing location and fast processing of gas data to interpret
    the

    results. Real-time sensing requires the deployment of many gas sensors, as well
    as reliable

    processing resources, to train a model [261]. Numerous IoT-based IAQ-monitoring
    sys-

    tems and devices involving open-source data-processing and communication technologies

    have been commercialized. The sensor’s detecting qualities, such as sensitivity,
    selectivity,

    and reaction time, may be improved by adjusting and altering the charge transfer
    be-

    tween the analyte and sensing material. However, the condition that IAQ sensors
    identify

    contaminants at sufﬁciently low concentration levels is more difﬁcult to meet
    [260].

    A 2D metal oxide nanosheet (NS)-based humidity sensor with a wearable wristband-

    type sensing module has been proposed as a practical demonstration of real-time
    fast breath

    humidity monitoring during normal breathing. It is necessary to collect real-time
    breath

    humidity data to calibrate gas sensors against interference signals in breath
    components

    and to reliably monitor a patient’s physiological information for non-invasive
    and point-

    of-care diagnostics applications. Metallic ruthenium (Ru) oxide NSs and semiconductor

    manganese (Mn) oxide NSs were prepared separately on a ﬂexible substrate patterned
    with

    interdigitated sensing electrodes to investigate the different humidity-sensing
    behaviors.

    Resistance changes were measured after the NSs were exposed to various humidity
    lev-

    els [262]. Real-time rapid breath humidity monitoring during normal breathing
    has also

    been demonstrated using 2D metal oxide NSs. For this, a 2D NS-based humidity sensor

    in conjunction with a stretchable detecting module was worn on the wrist. The
    wearable

    sensor module wirelessly transmits sensor data to a smartphone. Breath enters
    the Ru oxide

    NS sensor, and real-time resistance changes are transmitted to a smartphone for
    viewing.

    The results demonstrated that the oxide NSs might be used directly to detect humidity
    in

    real-life situations since Mn and Ru oxide NSs had recovery durations of only
    24 and 8 s,

    respectively [262].

    Wearable technology demand is increasing exponentially, necessitating the develop-

    ment of enhanced smart wearable devices with low power consumption, real-time
    readout,

    biocompatibility, and self-healing capabilities. Even though there has been signiﬁcant

    progress in developing wearable environmental sensors, several obstacles and challenges

    are yet to be overcome. In terms of materials, a better understanding of the characteristics

    of nanoparticles is required to achieve biocompatibility and self-healing capabilities,
    as

    well as high performance and low operating costs. Furthermore, biosynthesis-based
    green

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    54 of 73

    techniques can be exploited for the on-site cleanup of nanomaterials from environmental

    pollutants [263].

    6.3. Repeatability and Reusability

    Sensor metrics related to repeatability and reusability are often ignored, as
    there

    is a focus on describing a novel methodology, transduction mechanism, and approach.

    Nevertheless, a novel technology that can have an actual impact needs to address
    issues

    with sensing repeatability and sensor reusability, among other metrics. These
    are often

    factors limiting the commercial success of a proposed sensing approach. Other
    important

    parameters are the manufacturability and large-scale bulk fabrication of a sensor
    (thus,

    repeatability in the sensor manufacturing process, i.e., throughput), fabrication,
    operational

    costs, and maintenance. These are often considered once the technology has matured

    beyond a validated prototype and at high technology readiness levels (TRLs), but
    should

    form an essential part of the process from conception in order to guarantee favourable

    results. Repeatability is related to concepts discussed in the previous sections,
    such as

    hysteresis and drift. If the sensor response drifts continuously over time, the
    repeatability

    of the measurement is affected. When cycling through the range of values of a
    target

    analyte, if the sensor does not always lead to the same values, again, repeatability
    is not

    guaranteed. These are crucial in real-life scenarios, where a mixture of gases
    will be present,

    and the various concentrations will be unknown and varying. Sensing materials
    critical

    for transducing a physical event into an electrical signal must be reusable and
    not saturate

    within the range of interest. The repeatability and reusability of micro-hotplate-based

    gas sensors are also related to the ability of the hotplate and sensing layer
    to sustain the

    required elevated temperatures over time, especially over multiple operating cycles.
    As

    discussed in other sections, thermal stress can be translated into mechanical
    stress, forming

    cracks and pinholes. At the same time, the elevated temperatures can also cause
    microwire

    thermal elements to fuse and delaminate [264,265].

    6.4. Power Consumption

    Power consumption must be considered when designing portable electronic devices

    (point-of-need, point-of-care, etc.), especially wearables. Wearable systems are
    expected

    to be as unintrusive and hassle-free as possible to facilitate end users’ wide
    acceptance

    rate and seamlessly integrate into their daily routines. Power consumption will
    dictate

    battery size, which needs to be kept small to enhance wearability, portability,
    and overall

    system integration. At the same time, it also dictates the frequency of battery
    recharging

    and charging times. To a large extent, power consumption is dictated by the implemented

    electronic instrumentation and whether wireless data transmission is required,
    as well as

    the frequency of sensor readout and data transmission (continuous vs. periodic).
    ASIC

    implementations with deep submicron technology nodes must be used to push the
    power

    supply rails to a minimum (below 1 V) while exploiting weak inversion operation
    where

    possible in the analogue CMOS front-end electronics and analogue signal processing
    and

    computation. At the same time, the sensing modality can also dictate power consumption.

    For example, optical sensing methods are generally more power-consuming than purely

    electrical ones. Many sensing approaches use direct current (DC) electrical measurements;

    thus, bandwidth is not an issue, and power consumption can be kept low. In contrast,

    many gas sensors use micro-hotplates exploiting Joule heating, which can be energy-

    consuming [250]. Such metal-oxide-based sensors rely on chemical reactions requiring

    high temperatures to improve their efﬁciency, leading to increased power consumption

    in the range of 100 s of mW to 1 W. Thermal isolation using micromachining techniques

    can reduce their power consumption by a few mW [250]. Consequently, a single gas
    sensor

    can consume tens or hundreds of mW. This will limit the number of sensing elements
    and

    targets possible for many applications, necessitating large batteries and/or leading
    to a

    short battery life, which is unsuitable for wearable multiparametric applications.
    Pulsed

    temperature operation (PTO) is a mode of operation commonly used with such gas
    sensors

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    55 of 73

    to extend the system’s battery life and reduce power consumption. Essentially,
    the device

    is turned on and off (hence, the term ‘pulsed’), and the ratio of the on to the
    total cycle

    duration is inversely proportional to the power saved. PTO duty cycles above 20%
    are

    typically used. Unfortunately, PTO is associated with reduced sensor performance,
    e.g.,

    slower response time with long transient periods before the sensor response stabilizes.

    Researchers have studied and exploited various characteristics in the sensor transient

    response to extract useful information, such as the minimal, maximal, and steady-state

    device resistances [250]. Recently, a µW-range PTO scheme was proposed [250].
    This low-

    power approach was evaluated by detecting ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ammonia
    gases

    using three Au-doped SnO2 and one SnO2 device, each with a separate 80 µm diameter

    micro-hotplate. A 1.61 V supply to the heaters induced 400 ◦C temperature, allowing

    a 1.5 ms thermal time constant and a 14.5 mW power consumption for each element.

    The sensors were integrated into a PCB with off-the-shelf components, radio-frequency

    identiﬁcation (RFID) capabilities, and an on-PCB inductor. Under these conditions,
    a

    25 mAh battery can supply the system for only 40 min or 2.7 h if only one device
    is used.

    Low-power operation modes degrade sensor sensitivity. The temperature can be controlled

    using pulse-width modulation (PWM) in the excitation signal at 30 kHz instead
    of DC,

    with 1.8 V pulses and duty cycles between 10% to 0.05%. This depends on several
    processes

    on the device, such as ensuring that the device has reached a steady-state temperature

    (which is possible with the modes explored, 5 ms required vs. 32.5 ms used). Nevertheless,

    the ionic species on the sensor surface involved in the chemical reaction with
    the target

    analyte require some time to reach a new equilibrium and take place [250]. These
    slow

    processes are not adequately understood and are challenging to establish theoretically.
    It

    has been found that they cannot reach the stationary state with very short temperature

    pulses, limiting sensitivity, which experimentally changes logarithmically with
    the power

    applied to the sensor heater. Nevertheless, only a moderate sensitivity decline
    was found

    within the proposed power-saving modes. Even so, the sensitivity is in the same
    order of

    magnitude with continuous temperature stimulation operation. Mixed conclusions
    were

    drawn for the LOD, as there seemed to be a dependency on the type of target volatile,

    and, thus, it needs to be explored case-by-case. The NH3 LOD remained constant;
    for

    acetaldehyde, it dropped ﬁve times, while for ethylene, it increased. The most
    signiﬁcant

    degradation is related to the sensors’ response time, which can be several hours
    (between

    10–20 h for aggressive power consumption reduction towards less than 200 µW) compared

    to 10 min. This can be detrimental in wearable applications.

    It is clear from the above that much effort has been focused on maintaining the

    operating temperature high to ensure selectivity, sensitivity, and LOD are high.
    Micro-

    hotplate technology enabled by microfabrication techniques is one approach to
    maintaining

    high-temperature operation and reducing overall power consumption. This reduces
    the

    power consumption from 100 s of mWs to 10 s of mWs [266].

    Modiﬁcation of the overall geometry of the heating element (shape, track width,

    thickness, and length), as well as the material, and reducing the device’s thermal
    con-

    ductivity will affect the overall power consumption of the element, as these are
    based on

    Joule heating, which is proportional to the electrical power and thus the resistance
    of the

    device and the voltage applied to the device or the current ﬂowing through the
    device.

    However, increasing the electrical resistance of the heating element to reduce
    the power

    consumption must be carried out with caution to ensure that the component (most
    often

    a wire) can sustain the current injected and the temperature induced, and that
    it does

    not fail. Using cavities and insulating material optimization (e.g., Si3N4 or
    SiO2) can also

    aid in reducing power consumption [264]. One approach uses suspended structures
    or

    examples achieved through micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) processes. It
    has

    been found that reducing the number of bridges to the suspended structure and
    their width

    also reduces power consumption. Nevertheless, others have focused on reducing
    power

    consumption by operating sensors at RT, which hampers gas sensors’ sensitivity,
    selectivity,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    56 of 73

    LOD, and response time. Thus, efforts have been made to enhance these using, for
    example,

    additional membranes, hybrid materials, and noble-metal functionalization [264,265].

    Another approach is to exploit energy-harvesting approaches. For example, piezoelec-

    tric and triboelectric nanogenerators have been demonstrated that allow RT operation
    [267].

    ZnO can generate a piezoelectric output acting as the power source and the sensing
    signal.

    Incorporating metals such as Cu, Pd, Au, and Pt into ZnO enhances catalytic reactions
    and

    sensing performance. ZnO-oxide-based heterostructures, such as ZnO2/SnO2, ZnO/In2O3,

    and ZnO/NiO, enhance sensitivity, leading to a stronger output signal [267]. Gases
    ad-

    sorbed on the surface of triboelectric nanogenerators affect the charging effectiveness
    of

    these devices, which can be exploited as a sensing mechanism [267]. Self-heating
    devices

    are a promising class of devices. MOS nanowire (NW) materials are typically preferred

    for such devices. NWs act as the pathways for electron transfer, and their length
    relates

    to the temperature generated. The diameter of the nanowires is also associated
    with the

    latter [267]. Essentially, increasing the resistance of the nanowire will push
    the power

    consumption down. This approach leads to µWs of power consumption due to the limited

    thermal capacitance of the NWs [267]. SnO2 NWs with diameters in the 95 nm region
    that

    can be grown with a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method are one example that has demon-

    strated a power consumption of 25 nW and the response of 2.1–2.5 ppm for NO2 [267].

    CVD has also been used to create 80 nm NWs of SnO2 for C2H5OH sensing [267]. Deco-

    rating such NWs with Ag nanoparticles has allowed for the low temperature and,
    thus,

    low power detection (<20 mW) of H2S with a response of up to 21.2 ppm at 2 mW
    and

    a response/recovery time of 18/980 s [267]. ZnO decorated with Pt or Pd with voltages

    1–20 V applied to them is also a promising approach for the RT detection of toluene
    and

    benzene [267]. At 5 V, the power consumption was only 208 µW and 139 µW, respectively.

    The power consumption in these sensors depends on the electrode sensing area and
    the

    design of head-to-head electrodes [267]. Au/SnO2-ZnO core-shell NW are the most
    promis-

    ing materials for low-power self-heating gas sensors. Nevertheless, NW-based devices

    require complex multistep fabrication processes with low yield and are, thus,
    unsuitable

    for large-scale bulk fabrication [37,155,160,265,267,268].

    6.5. Gas-Sensitive Material Deposition

    The various gas-selective membranes can be deposited on the sensing surfaces using
    a

    plethora of manufacturing approaches. This subject was recently reviewed in detail
    [265],

    and, here, we will thus only discuss this in summary. Drop casting, followed by
    baking,

    is probably the most straightforward method for realising thick ﬁlms with hard-to-deﬁne

    thickness. Liquid phase deposition (LPD) is a low-temperature growth method that
    leads

    to dense ﬁlms characterized by a slow response. An effective technique is atomic
    layer

    deposition (ALD), which allows ultra-thin ﬁlms with precise thickness and composition

    even at low temperatures. ALD is, however, a slow and high-cost specialized process.

    Nevertheless, LPD and ALD are suitable for SnO2 deposition, a standard gas-sensing

    material in chemiresistors [265].

    CVD is another common technique to obtain gas-sensing thin ﬁlms, such as NiO

    and graphene, with favourable crystallinities and uniformities suitable for large-area

    deposition; however, impurities can be quickly introduced in the process. Sputtering
    is an

    established method for thin-ﬁlm deposition ideal for the mass production of high-quality

    and highly repeatable sensing ﬁlms, e.g., SnO2, WO3, ZnO, CuO, and MoS2. It requires

    a high vacuum, and the adhesion of the deposited ﬁlms is increased. In situ growth
    of

    gas-sensing nanomaterials is another low-cost approach suitable for mass production.
    This

    is often used with ZnO-based materials to create nanowires and nano-branched geometries.

    The adhesion of the generated ﬁlms is good, but the steps required to prepare
    the solutions

    used in the process can be high [265]. Self-assembly of sensing membranes directly
    on

    electrodes and substrates is a powerful approach. It is based on electrostatic
    interactions to

    realise highly ordered thin ﬁlms with a fast response time. An advantage of in
    situ and self-

    assembly methods is that they do not require expensive equipment and are relatively
    cheap

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    57 of 73

    processes suitable for mass-fabricating porous gas-sensing membranes. Another
    simple

    method is DEP, a low-cost, simple RT method with good repeatability [265]. Deﬁning

    the frequency and amplitude of the excitation signal can be a challenge. It allows
    the

    arrangement of the gas-sensitive material along the direction of the electric
    ﬁeld gradient

    on the surface of, for example, a hotplate. This approach has been used to deposit
    ZnO and

    InO nanowires from dispersions. Following DEP, an annealing step is typically
    used at

    elevated temperatures (e.g., 400 ◦C) [265].

    Spray pyrolysis is another simple method belonging to the additive manufacturing

    family of techniques for the realization of thick, porous ﬁlms by spraying inks
    over heated

    substrates. The adhesion of the generated ﬁlms using this method can be poor.
    Another

    additive approach is inkjet printing [265]. This approach has been used to print-on-demand

    thick ﬁlms from inks of, for example, Pd-modiﬁed SnO2 nanoﬁbers and SnO2 nanoparticles

    onto hotplates. Inkjet printing, however, being a direct-write technique, can
    be a slow

    process unsuitable for large-scale fabrication; depending on the resolution, accuracy,
    and

    inkjet-printing method used, it can be both a low-cost and high-cost technique.
    Stencil

    printing and its related method, screen printing, are simple, low-cost techniques
    for printing

    both electrodes (e.g., interdigitated) and gas-sensing membranes [265]. These
    techniques

    require relatively thick pasty inks to be used, especially if small features with
    excellent

    resolution are needed. Screen printing has the advantage of being able to print
    closed

    geometries, e.g., circles, that stencils cannot print. Both techniques are suitable
    for the

    large-scale bulk fabrication of devices. Spray coating can be combined with stencil
    printing

    to create sensing ﬁlms. The thickness and uniformity of thick ﬁlms deposited with
    additive

    methods can be hard to control and deﬁne [265].

    6.6. Selectivity and Sensitivity

    Selectivity is an essential aspect of any sensing technology. A sensor needs to
    provide

    sensitivity, or, at least, the primary sensitivity, from only one speciﬁc event,
    e.g., the change

    in the concentration of one target gas within a mixture of gases. If the sensor
    is sensitive

    to more than one analyte, then it may not be possible to distinguish what the
    recorded

    response is from and to reach realistic conclusions. However, it may be that different

    analytes lead to different responses in the measured output signal, such as different
    ranges

    or different transient behaviors that can lead to safe conclusions. Nevertheless,
    this is not

    ideal, as interpreting the measured data can be challenging and may lead to ambiguities.

    The ratio of sensor signal response the target gas reaches to that achieved with
    other

    interfering gases is often used to deﬁne selectivity [269]. The above can be described
    as

    intrinsic sensor selectivity.

    Principal component analysis, machine learning, and other statistical approaches
    can

    be exploited to address the above issues and enhance measurement interpretation
    [270].

    Such data-processing approaches can be categorized as analysis selectivity enhancement

    approaches, that, when possible, can enhance the selectivity of the sensor with
    low intrinsic

    selectivity. However, their capability to operate in small portable devices and
    at the

    component level, e.g., in a low-power microcontroller or a custom integrated circuit,
    with

    ultra-low power consumption for on-node data processing, is an area of signiﬁcant
    interest

    and current development. It is expected to inﬂuence the pervasiveness of these
    sensors

    in wearable applications. Furthermore, using gas sensor arrays and analyzing sensing

    patterns among many such elements employing different temperatures or different
    sensing

    materials and membranes and employing pattern recognition approaches to the recorded

    data is another approach to enhancing sensing accuracy [269,270]. In any case,
    enhancing

    selectivity/speciﬁcity enhances the conﬁdence in the conclusions drawn when interpreting

    sensor data and reduces false positives/negatives.

    The methods exploited to enhance the selectivity of gas sensors can be roughly
    divided

    into two categories: (i) physical and (ii) chemical modiﬁcations [269]. The former
    is related

    to changing the device’s physical properties, such as surface structure and morphology

    (e.g., roughness, porosity, and geometry), or using membranes that essentially
    act as ﬁlters.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    58 of 73

    The latter involves using materials that recognize a target molecule through chemical

    processes chosen based on the target molecule’s chemical properties, required
    reactions, or

    adsorption abilities [269]. Chemical modiﬁcations lead to excellent selectivity,
    and several

    approaches involving both families of modiﬁcation approaches can be exploited
    [269].

    Chemical modiﬁcation methods can be categorized themselves, as well as into strategies

    based on catalyst decoration (e.g., using oxidation, dissociation, and adsorption
    catalysts),

    composite formation (e.g., using conductive, imprinted, or non-conjugated polymers),

    or surface functionalization (e.g., using active chemical, organometallic compounds,
    or

    self-assembled monolayers, SAMs) [269]. For example, oxidation catalysts can promote
    the

    oxidation of a target gas, increasing the reaction rate between surface-adsorbed
    oxygen and

    the target (e.g., Cr-doped NiO for toluene and o-Xylene, and ZnO nanoﬁbers for
    H2) [269].

    On the other hand, dissociation catalysts indirectly increase the surface reaction

    rate. For example, Ag-loaded metal oxides, such as SnO2 and TiO2, lead to high
    ethanol

    selectivity. The increased alkalinity leads to ethanol decomposition into acetaldehyde
    that,

    due to higher polarity and reactivity, leads to enhanced sensing performance.
    Another

    example is noble metals, such as Pt or Pd, for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions.
    The

    preferential adsorption afﬁnity of a target to the catalyst surface augments the
    target-sensing

    reaction. Examples include Ag-ZnO-rGO for acetylene and Cu2O-loaded graphene for
    H2S.

    Disadvantages of catalysts include catalyst poisoning, susceptibility to humidity,
    and the

    requirement for high temperatures, which can be addressed by using, for example,
    UV

    irradiation instead of heat, using hydrophobic materials, and employing protective
    layers.

    Nanocomposites of PANI with MOSs, graphene, or CNTs are typical for detecting
    NH3,

    while porous SnO2 with poly-3-hexythiopene (P3HT) is selective to NO2 [269].

    Polymers can swell in the presence of speciﬁc gases. This can be exploited, for
    example,

    both for resistive and capacitive sensing. One example of the family of nano-conjugated

    polymers is polyetherimide (PEI) composites with carbon black (CB) that have been
    mod-

    iﬁed to provide increased nitrogen to oxygenated sites and have been found helpful
    for

    detecting medium-length aldehydes. Adsorption of aldehydes to the nitrogenated
    sites

    leads to the swelling of the polymer [269]. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)
    are

    materials with template-induced cavities that allow target recognition by the
    shape and

    size of the molecule, in addition to functional groups and adsorption afﬁnity.
    Binding the

    target gas to the template leads to the expansion of the polymer and, thus, a
    considerable

    change in conductivity. Chemical modiﬁcation methods aim to increase the chemical
    afﬁn-

    ity between the sensor surface and the target gas by exploiting the chemical properties
    of

    the gas. One example of active chemicals is rGO, a p-type semiconductor. rGO modiﬁed

    with sulfanilic acid is further p-doped as the added acid is electron-withdrawing,
    and NO2

    enhances this, leading to enhanced conductivity [269]. SWCNTs non-covalently modiﬁed

    with pyrene/cobalt phthalocyanine also attained selective detection of H2S [271].
    Another

    example of NO2 detection is the functionalization of WO3 with (3-aminopropyl)
    triethoxysi-

    lane (APTES), while APTES-modiﬁed silicon nanowires have demonstrated speciﬁcity
    to

    trinitrotoluene (TNT) [269]. Biomimetic SAMs use oligopeptides, mimicking particular

    human olfactory receptors and are sensitive to heat and irradiation [269].

    For example, RT operation in resistive metal-oxide sensors can be challenging
    as

    their selectivity is severely limited in low temperatures. Signiﬁcant efforts
    have been

    made towards achieving this goal, as RT operation would signiﬁcantly reduce their
    power

    consumption, primarily in the 100 s of mW range [270]. Some approaches have, thus,
    been

    examined to enhance RT selectivity, some of these mentioned earlier. These include
    using

    permeable membranes, combining n- and p-type metal oxides to form heterostructures,

    nanocomposites, or core-shell structures, doping semiconducting oxides with metal
    ions,

    or functionalizing surfaces with various polymers or metal oxides, and combinations
    of

    all the above [270]. Physical modiﬁcation of membranes is the critical element
    in this

    direction, particularly zeolite-based materials and 2D nanomaterials, such as
    graphene and

    GO. Porous graphene with angstrom-sized pores demonstrates selective molecular
    sieving

    and properties superior to polymer and silica membranes. GO sheets stack non-uniformly,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    59 of 73

    allowing permeability to small gases without requiring the formation of pores.
    Based on the

    above, ZnO metal oxide nanowires with < 50 nm nanoporous GO membranes have been

    proposed to reduce the permeability of speciﬁc gases. This allowed highly selective
    ultra-

    low power (200 nW) H2 gas sensing. It is evident, thus, that there is an interdependency

    between selectivity and power consumption [270].

    6.7. Stability and Response/Recovery Time

    Sensor response stability (drift), response and recovery time, and hysteresis
    are essen-

    tial metrics deﬁning a sensor’s operation and capability to be used in speciﬁc
    applications.

    The response time of a sensor needs to be shorter than the transient response
    of the ana-

    lyte being measured. The sensor signal should stabilize and minimally drift within
    this

    timeframe to allow monitoring of this transience. If the measurement changes before
    the

    sensor response stabilize to take a measurement, the acquired data will not be
    valid. In

    addition, the hysteresis needs to be smaller than the required LODs to avoid measurement

    ambiguities and false negatives/positives regarding thresholds. Speciﬁc sensors,
    such as

    electrochemical sensors, often need conditioning in speciﬁc gaseous or liquid
    environments

    before use. Other sensors based on the change of material properties, such as
    analyte-

    responsive polymer/hydrogels that allow sensing through changes of shape (volume),

    will typically require longer times to respond, stabilize, and recover. Resistive-typed
    gas

    sensors employing micro-hotplates must establish a stable operational temperature.
    This

    can be in the range of ms [250].

    In addition, the chemical reactions on the surface of the material being used
    as the

    sensing surface are related to their time constants and kinetics that need to
    stabilize, which

    are slow processes. These are not adequately understood and are typically examined
    and

    established experimentally [250]. The use of methods for reducing power consumption,

    such as PTO in micro-hotplate resistive sensors, can signiﬁcantly negatively inﬂuence

    the response time of these sensors from a few minutes to tens of hours [250].
    Stability is

    also related to the actual endurance and lifetime of the device. For example,
    excessive

    heating over long periods will lead to mechanical deformation of a micro-hotplate
    due to

    the induced thermal stress, and the heating element can also fuse [264]. This
    mechanical

    deformation can also cause the devices to crack, thus damaging the sensing materials

    and causing sensor failure [264]. Geometrical optimization, e.g., through ﬁnite
    element

    simulations, can reduce these mechanical stresses and thus enhance the endurance
    and

    lifetime of these devices [264]. The choice of materials used can have a meaningful
    impact

    on the lifetime and stability of the device. For example, ceramics have a smaller
    coefﬁcient of

    thermal expansion than silicon; thus, the ratio of the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion
    of a Pt

    heating wire to that of a ceramic will be smaller than with silicon as the substrate
    [264,265].

    Consequently, thermal stress is smaller. Adhesion of Pt to ceramics can be good,
    but

    care must be taken to ensure delamination and pinholes/porosity are not induced
    at

    elevated temperatures. Using intermediate adhesion-promoting layers such as Ti
    addresses

    these [264,265]. Using suspended structures realised using cavities while allowing
    lower

    power consumption leads to structures with reduced stability over time compared
    to

    standard closed-ﬁlm devices.

    7. Conclusions and Outlook

    This review presented an update to almost all aspects of available smart wearable

    (nano)sensing devices for the environmental monitoring of gaseous pollutants,
    with a

    focus on the challenges in the optimization of sensor performance which is, currently,
    a

    considerable gap in the literature. Different sensing modalities and approaches,
    as well as

    materials and manufacturing methods, were thoroughly reviewed, also discussing
    many

    recent examples from the published academic literature for different gases of
    interest. As

    there is an urgent demand for fabricating reliable sensing platforms to detect
    and quantify

    these pollutants accurately, devised multidisciplinary approaches should be proposed.
    On

    the other hand, these approaches should constantly implicate the concerns and
    opinions of

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    60 of 73

    analytical chemists, biochemists, ecological and environmental researchers, toxicologists,

    risk management specialists, and governmental authorities in order to be upgraded
    to

    an industrial level. Distinctive features of various novel nanomaterials, especially
    their

    ability to accommodate necessary functionalization, have made them promising candidates

    for using sensors for gaseous pollutants. Wearable gas sensors will progress technically

    over the following years due to their great potential toward real-time multiparametric
    non-

    intrusive smart wearable sensing. This is further supported by the numerous applications

    where such sensors are valuable, that range from body monitoring for work safety
    to

    theranostics, and the added beneﬁt they can have, which should support user acceptability

    and widespread deployment.

    Moreover, to turn the challenge of commercialization of these advanced sensors
    into an

    opportunity, a thorough marketing endeavor is required so that people trust these
    high-tech

    devices enough to use them in daily life activities. To achieve this, the sensing
    device should

    be simple and comfortable enough to be directly managed and controlled by the
    user and

    to seamlessly be integrated into daily routines without requiring signiﬁcantly
    more effort

    by the users. Moreover, technology developers, employers, and industry stakeholders
    must

    agree to compromise on the additional expenses of providing these platforms to
    users.

    From the perspective of electronic engineering and material science, there are
    still

    unsolved problems in fabricating a conformable skin-friendly sensing device, as
    excellent

    biocompatibility, elasticity, and stretchability should be added to the substrates
    to be used

    on human skin. However, some ﬂexible substrates lack the required surface energy
    to deal

    with surface adhesion issues. For instance, chemical functionalization and oxygen
    plasma

    treatment can be used to improve the adhesion of the substrate to other components
    of

    stretchable sensors. Important challenges are also related to the power consumption
    of

    such sensors, which becomes a critical and limiting parameter for wearable applications.

    Selectivity, sensitivity, and multi-parametric sensing are crucial aspects for
    a robust gas

    sensor that can be successfully commercially launched, aspects that also become
    challenging

    to achieve in a wearable format. Sensor lifetime, robustness, and contamination
    issues

    are also challenges crucial for wearable sensors, as well as motion artifacts
    that could

    arise from sensitivity to mechanical perturbations. Since, in some cases, used
    sensors

    should be disposable, sensor fabrication costs should be reduced as much as possible,

    while biodegradability and ecological impact should also be considered. Co-integration

    in a miniaturized and wearable (ﬂexible or stretchable) format of all aspects
    required for

    a wearable implementation, including battery or energy scavenging, sensor, and
    front-

    end (analog) and back-end (digital), as well as radio frequency (RF, antenna,
    transceiver,

    etc.) components, is the current challenge that needs to be addressed, together
    with the

    above-mentioned aspects, for the next generation of wearable gas sensors. Such
    work will

    potentially lead towards the development of hybrid co-packed systems, and, thus,
    several

    advancements are required toward this direction and the heterogeneous integration
    of

    different devices and technologies. It might also be possible to fabricate near-zero-cost
    gas

    sensors (e.g., PB types) to detect gaseous pollutants. In terms of manufacturing
    technologies,

    for the high resolution, miniaturization, throughput, and quality of the end product,

    standard microfabrication techniques should be preferred. However, current advanced

    ion additive manufacturing approaches should not be overlooked. While often inferior
    in

    terms of manufacturing resolution, they come with certain advantages. These include
    the

    lower cost of fabrication and manufacturing instruments, and the fact that a clean
    room is

    not needed. Techniques such as inkjet, screen, stencil, and extrusion-based printing,
    laser

    engraving and carbonization, stamping and transfer printing, and their variations
    and their

    combination can be exploited to create devices, while they can also be combined,
    if needed,

    with microfabrication approaches for critical stages of the manufacturing process
    [272–281].

    Each of these methods comes with their constraints in terms of material properties
    they are

    most suitable to be used with, manufacturing temperatures, ﬁnal device dimensions,
    etc., so

    materials need to be carefully selected and optimized. As a result, manufacturing
    different

    system parts with different techniques might be required, leading to the aforementioned

    Sensors 2023, 23, 8648

    61 of 73

    requirement for heterogeneous integration. In terms of materials, MOS materials,
    carbon

    nanomaterials, and catalysts play an important role in gas sensors and their future.
    The

    selection of these and their combination needs careful thinking and needs to be
    tailored

    to the speciﬁc application. The ﬁnal form factor and device ﬂexibility and stretchability

    are of prime importance for wearable applications, as well as power consumption
    and

    mechanical robustness. A self-powered, low-power-consumption system should, thus,

    be the focus in the next generation of wearable gas sensors and TENG technologies;
    in

    addition, sweat biofuel cells are promising roots towards that direction [282–284].
    For

    deployment directly worn on the body, skin adhesion should be considered. In addition,

    sensor lifetime and reusability, especially following long wearable use and repeated
    cycles

    of removing and reattaching on the body, will prove critical. For devices meant
    for clothing

    integration, the possibility of reversible attachment to clothes could be a solution
    to avoid

    damage during washing. Crucial aspects of gas sensor performance and wearability
    are

    also related to the operational temperature of the sensor, its response and recovery
    time, and

    its sensitivity to relative humidity. The effect of humidity on gas sensor response
    has been

    highlighted throughout the paper. One approach to evaluate and properly interpret
    sensor

    response could be the co-integration of humidity sensors [285,286]. Alternatively,
    device,

    material, and machine-learning approaches can be explored [287–292]. Room-temperature-

    operated MOS sensors with remarkable performance are emerging [293]. As in several

    technological domains, the recent explosion in the development, use, and perturbation

    of machine-learning approaches, such techniques can immensely impact the area
    of gas

    sensors. Several papers where machine-learning approaches are used to aid gas
    sensors

    have been recently published [148,294–297].

    These small nano-based gas sensors can also impact the economy and employment.

    Companies can easily monitor toxic gases in their warehouses and working areas
    by

    applying a smart control system. In fact, with the help of smart wearable sensing
    technology,

    which minimizes human errors, employees can work in a safe environment where gas

    leaks can be successfully detected, thereby preventing catastrophic incidents
    in factory

    equipment maintenance, and ensuring the efﬁcient storage of goods and products
    with no

    loss. Such solutions can also be utilized in modern forest management (e.g., ﬁre
    prevention)

    in the fabrication of forester or ﬁreﬁghter clothes and outﬁts, as wildﬁres are
    the most

    common form of natural disasters in which large amounts of, for example, CO, CO2,
    NO,

    and SO2 are released into the atmosphere. More research is required to provide
    a brighter

    vision of the potential of this technology in accelerating the development and
    application

    of novel smart wearable sensors in the near future.

    \ crop quality. In this paper, on the basis of introducing the \ncharacteristics\
    \ of farmland crop data, different farmland crop information \nacquisition methods\
    \ are surveyed in detail, sections need to be improved of \nthese methods and\
    \ related core technologies will be discussed. At last, this \npaper gives a table\
    \ about crop information acquisition technology and sensing \ninstrument systems\
    \ applied in different levels (individual level, area level and \nwide-area level).\
    \ \nKeywords: precision agriculture (PA), crop information, information acquisition.\
    \  \n1 \nIntroduction \nAll Food is the paramount necessity of human beings, and\
    \ the essential material basis \nfor any country on the way of development. China\
    \ is a great agricultural country with \nlarge population, limited soil resources\
    \ and traditional manual farming methods. With \nall these challenges, precision\
    \ agriculture (PA) technologies have been used to \nimprove field practices in\
    \ crop production these years. PA provides a way to optimize \nagricultural production\
    \ inputs, such as irrigation, fertilizing and spraying, based on \nfarmland soil,\
    \ environment and crop information at individual areas within a field, \nrather\
    \ than applying uniform inputs across the entire field. In this way people can\
    \ \nobtain not only the best economic benefits but also the ecological benefits.\
    \ \nThe three main components involved in PA are information acquisition, data\
    \ \ninterpretation, and variable-rate application. The PA is an information-based\
    \ \ntechnology. Only spatial information on field conditions as well as inputs\
    \ and outputs \nof the field are accurately collected, can PA be successful [1].\
    \ The technology of \nfarmland information acquisition directly affects the degree\
    \ of agricultural \ninformatization and the accuracy of agricultural production’s\
    \ decisions. How to get \nfield soil, environment and crop information conveniently\
    \ and quickly is the critical \nissue throughout the entire process of PA. Yet\
    \ conventional acquisition method of \nfarmland information, which mainly including\
    \ traditional information retrieval \nmethods and chemical diagnostic methods\
    \ have many limitations. As to be known, \nappearance analysis method has strong\
    \ subjectivity and poor accuracy; chemical \n \nA Survey on Farmland Crop Information\
    \ Acquisition \n207 \n \ndiagnosis is based on laboratory analysis of crop organizations,\
    \ generally requires \nanalyzing samples of crop, costs a lot of time, manpower\
    \ and material resources [2]. \nThe PA requires fast, real-time and positioning\
    \ measurement. As the traditional crop \ninformation acquisition methods cannot\
    \ meet the requirement of variable fertilization, \nwe need to develop new methods,\
    \ especially the technical method and sensing \nequipment can be used for fast\
    \ acquisition of farmland information must be developed \nto meet the need of\
    \ PA research and practice. \nFarmland information can be divided into three parts:\
    \ soil information, \nenvironment information, and crop information [3]. Soil\
    \ information, including soil \nmoisture, pH, organic matter content, conductivity,\
    \ soil nutrients, and soil tillage \nresistance and etc. is the one of the main\
    \ object of studying farmland information. \nFarmland environment information\
    \ includes air temperature, humidity, light intensity, \ncrop pests, and etc.\
    \ Crop information includes crop growth information (such as \ncanopy structure,\
    \ leaf area index, plant height, etc.), crop nutrition information \n(including\
    \ chlorophyll content, crop water status, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium \netc.)\
    \ and some other information. Crop information is the most important index used\
    \ \nin regulating plant growth, diagnosing crop nutrient deficiency, and predicting\
    \ crop \nyields. All these information can make a contribution to agricultural\
    \ land management \nand decision-making. High production, high-efficiency and\
    \ modernizing agriculture \ncan’t become true without the help of all kinds of\
    \ information.  \nIn this paper, on the basis of introducing the characteristics\
    \ of farmland data, \ndifferent farmland crop information acquisition methods\
    \ and related core technologies \nwill be surveyed and discussed. \n2 \nCharacteristic\
    \ of Farmland Crop Information \nIt is extremely important to instruct the agricultural\
    \ production by knowing the crop it \nself’s information. The farmland system\
    \ is a very complicated ecology system, \ninvolves different kinds of factors.\
    \ Even the crop itself is a complicated system. The \ncollecting of crop data\
    \ usually incurs the substantial costs and technologies [4]. To \nunderstand the\
    \ characteristic of crop information fully is very necessary. There are the \n\
    characteristic of farmland crop information. A) Spatiality. The production of\
    \ crop is \nassociated with spatial factors. Every farmland has its own geographic\
    \ location and \nboundaries. Spatial data is usually used in generating different\
    \ maps as coordinates. \nB) Complexity. Any agricultural system has huge factors\
    \ include not only directly \nrelated factors but also indirectly related factors.\
    \ Each factor contains its sub-factors. \nFarmland crop data can be collected\
    \ from multiple sources such as onboard sensors, \nhandheld devices, remote sensing,\
    \ satellite, history material, etc.  Categories of data \nare diverse, including\
    \ text, number, image, sound, video, etc. C) Dynamics. All the \ninformation is\
    \ changing all the time according to the time and space [5]. In-time \nacquisition\
    \ of data is vital for PA. After all, all these factors increase the difficulty\
    \ of \ngetting agricultural crop data. People need to master high-tech and stable\
    \ \nmeasurements or means to shield interference and obtain accurate data. \n\
    208 \nD. Yi and H. Ji \n \n3 \nCrop Information Acquisition Methods \nCrop information\
    \ includes crop growth information, crop nutrition information, and \nsome other\
    \ information. \n3.1 \nCrop Growth Information \nGround observation, remote sensing\
    \ monitoring and model simulation are the main \nmethods of monitor crop growth\
    \ and development information. The leaf area index \n(LAI), canopy characterization,\
    \ canopy structure, plant height and other growth \nfactors are the main target\
    \ be measured to monitor crop-growing status [6].  \nRemote sensing is becoming\
    \ more and more popular for its unique advantages.  \nM. Susan Moran et al. [7]\
    \ successfully used aerial and satellite remote sensing data to \ninverse normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, which can be used for \ndiagnosis,\
    \ estimation and production forecasting of large area crops [8]. Huang \nJingfeng\
    \ et al. [9] established Rice-SRS model to estimate the yield of rice with \n\
    spectral normalized vegetation index obtained by NOAA/AVHRR satellite. Peng \n\
    Xiao et al. [10] used the TM remote sensing image to obtain NDVI and inverse the\
    \ \nLAI of rice. On the basis of domestic airborne imaging spectrum data and the\
    \ spectral \nresponse of the synchronous sampling data, Yang Minhua et al [11]\
    \ established wheat \ncanopy physical and chemical parameters estimation model\
    \ and realized the inversion \nof wheat canopy physical and chemical parameters\
    \ through aerial hyper spectral \nremote sensing.  \nInfrared beam, ultrasonic,\
    \ microelectrode constant current source technology and \nsome other technologies\
    \ can be used to monitor and analyze growing crops directly. \nShimizu H et al.\
    \ [12] used machine vision technology to non-contact measure three-\ndimensional\
    \ growth information of crops. Zhao Chunjiang et al. [13] developed an \ninstrument\
    \ to inverse LAI, vegetation cover degree, biomass index to assess crop \ncondition.\
    \ This instrument uses the near-infrared and red characteristic bands, and \n\
    detects the incident light and the reflected light of vegetation to get the NDVI\
    \ \n(normalized difference vegetation index) values. Aziz S A et al. [14] studied\
    \ \nultrasonic sensing technology. They used it as one approach for corn plant\
    \ canopy \ncharacterization. Lan Yubin et al. [15] developed a ground-based Multi-sensor\
    \ fusion \nintegration system, including a crop height sensor, a crop canopy analyzer\
    \ for LAI, a \nNDVI sensor, a multispectral camera, and a hyper spectroradiometer\
    \ to measure real-\ntime crop conditions involve NDVI, biomass, crop canopy structure,\
    \ and crop height. \nQu Yonghua et al. [16] developed an automatic system designed\
    \ on the basis of \nwireless sensors network (WSN) to collect crop structure parameters,\
    \ like LAI and \naverage leaf angle (ALA).  \nPlant height is an important parameter\
    \ to be considered for management decision \nmaking. Plant height is a sensitive\
    \ indicator to show plant health status and calculate \nyield potential in optimizing\
    \ field inputs. Sui Ruixiu et al. [17] used ultrasonic sensors \nto develop a\
    \ microcomputer-based measurement system to allow in-situ, non-\ndestructive measurement\
    \ for the morphological characteristics of bush-type plants. \nSearcy S W et al.\
    \ [18] developed and field-tested an infrared beam sensor mounted on \n \nA Survey\
    \ on Farmland Crop Information Acquisition \n209 \n \na mechanical arm, using\
    \ a “light curtain” for the cotton plant real-time height \nmeasurement. Tumbo\
    \ S D et al. [19] successfully used ultrasonic sensors in the \nmeasurement of\
    \ citrus tree volume. Ehsani M R et al. [20] investigated a laser-based \nsensor\
    \ which can realize real-time estimate of plant volume. The sensor also \nperformed\
    \ well in measuring the biomass and LAI of a plant after being calibrated. \n\
    Jones C L et al. [21] used ultrasonic distance sensing to realize plant height\
    \ data \ncollection, and estimated plant biomass using the product of top-view\
    \ surface area of \nthe plant. Sui Ruixiu et al. [22] used an ultrasonic sensor\
    \ installed on a field vehicle \nsuch as a sprayer to scan the plant canopy and\
    \ determine plant height in real time in \nsitu. A plant height map was generated\
    \ with the collected data by the sensor. \n3.2 \nCrop Nutrition Information \n\
    For crop chlorophyll content nondestructive testing, MINOLTA company in Japan\
    \ \nhas produced a kind of Chlorophyll meter, which emit red light (about 650nm)\
    \ and \nnear infrared light (about 940nm) by the light emitting diode to the receiver\
    \ through \nthe leaf samples. The receiver receives the signals and transfers\
    \ them into digital \nsignals that will be used by the microprocessor to calculate\
    \ the SPAD value. Yao \nJiansong et al. [23] used visible-near infrared spectroscopy\
    \ techniques to non-\ndestructive test rape leaf chlorophyll content information.\
    \ Liu Fei et al. [24] used \nvisible/near infrared spectrum technology, quickly\
    \ and accurately detected cucumber \nleaf SPAD value, which is helpful to the\
    \ development of testing equipment. \nNitrogen is one of the most important factors\
    \ that have a high impact on the \nproduction of crops. The main methods of monitoring\
    \ nitrogen are remote sensing \nimaging, machine vision technology, spectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Multi-spectral \nand hyperspectral imaging technology [25]. The\
    \ remote sensing based crop nitrogen \nnutrition diagnosis, most people use remote\
    \ sensing to inverse nitrogen concentration, \nnitrogen accumulation and other\
    \ parameters which can determine crop nitrogen \nnutritional status [26]. He Yong\
    \ et al. [2] developed a portable plant nutrients lossless \ntester to determine\
    \ plant chlorophyll, water, nitrogen content quickly, non-destructive, \nand simultaneously.\
    \ This instrument has a GPS and a wireless data transmission \nfunction. Combined\
    \ with GIS software management system, large-scale crop nutrient \ncontent distribution\
    \ map can be developed. Feng lei et al. [27] put the rape as the \nresearch object,\
    \ used computer multi-spectral imaging technology for rapidly, \naccurately and\
    \ non-destructive nitrogen diagnosis. \nCrop water information collection is the\
    \ basis of precision irrigation decision-\nmaking. It is a key for continuously,\
    \ quickly, and precisely information collecting. \nCrop water information is helpful\
    \ to develop advanced and reliable monitoring \nequipment. Crop water status information\
    \ collection technologies of crop individual \ninclude infrared temperature method,\
    \ leaf water potential, spectral method, etc. \nRegional crop water status information\
    \ is mainly obtained through remote sensing \nmethods, including thermal infrared\
    \ remote sensing and microwave remote sensing \nmethods [28]. Ji Haiyan et al.\
    \ [29] used near-infrared spectroscopy, developed a \nliving plant leaves water\
    \ testing instrument which adopts ultra-low-power \nmicroprocessor MSP430 and\
    \ new type of optical frequency conversion chip TSL230, \n210 \nD. Yi and H. Ji\
    \ \n \nenabled field site fast non-destructive testing of crop leaf water content.\
    \ Li \nDongsheng et al. [30] developed the leaf temperature-measuring instrument,\
    \ using \ninfrared thermometry to measure leaf temperature to estimate leaf moisture\
    \ state. \nCanopy temperature relative to ambient air temperature is often used\
    \ to assess \nplant stress caused by moisture deficit or high temperature [31]\
    \ [32]. Continuous \nmeasurement of plant canopy temperature is useful in both\
    \ research and agricultural \nproduction. James R. Mahana et al. [33] studied\
    \ a low-cost infrared sensor based \nwireless temperature monitoring system, assessed\
    \ the system’s reliability and \nstability, and verified the feasibility of low-cost\
    \ infrared temperature measurement \nsystem. O'Shaughnessy et al. [34] developed\
    \ a wireless sensor system comprised \nmainly of infrared thermometer thermocouples\
    \ located on a center pivot lateral and in \nthe field below to monitor crop canopy\
    \ temperatures. Daniel K. Fisher et al. [35] \ndeveloped and constructed a low-cost\
    \ microcontroller based system to monitor the \ntemperature and the water status\
    \ of crop. The system can realize automatic \nmeasurement of canopy temperature,\
    \ soil temperature, air temperature, and soil \nmoisture status in field. It includes\
    \ a digital infrared temperature sensor, choose \nMLX90614 (Melexis. Concord.\
    \ NH) infrared temperature module to get the plant \ncanopy (leaf) temperature.\
    \ The precision of the system is 0.3 degrees Celsius by \nexperiments. \n3.3 \n\
    Others \nCrop yield is the result of many factors, is the important data of the\
    \ variable \nassignment management [36]. Commercialized grain yield monitor systems\
    \ are \nmainly the AFS (advanced farming system) system (CASE IH Corporation,\
    \ U.S.), the \nFieldStar system (AGCO Corporation, British), the Greenstar system\
    \ (JohnDeree \nCorporation, USA), the PF (precision farming) system (AgLeader\
    \ Corporation, USA), \nthe production monitoring system of RDS, etc. All these\
    \ systems are equipped with \nGPS positioning system, can automatically monitor\
    \ crop production and make a crop \nyield map. Cereal production yield monitor\
    \ sensor is the core of these systems, \nincluding the photoelectric volumetric\
    \ flow sensor, the γ-ray impulse flow sensor and \nthe impulse type flow sensor\
    \ [3]. Some portable information collection and \ntransmission systems have combined\
    \ with GPS, GPRS or Zigbee technology, were \nbuilt to obtain pictures, sounds,\
    \ numbers, GPS information or any other data of field \ncrops [37-40].  \n4 \n\
    Discussions and Conclusions \n4.1 \nCrop Information Acquisition \nThere have\
    \ been many associated reports about rapid detection methods and \ninstruments\
    \ of the nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, and moisture content. And \nthere\
    \ are also some reports about detection methods of phosphorus and potassium \n\
    content. But the report about crop trace information is less. This is mainly because\
    \ the \n \nA Survey on Farmland Crop Information Acquisition \n211 \n \nmain crop\
    \ trace information is metal elements based, and their content is low. The \n\
    ordinary sensing technology still not meets the requirements, and the use of spectrum\
    \ \nand spectral imaging technologies doesn’t directly react to metal element\
    \ information. \n4.2 \nThe Core Technologies \n• GPS \nFarmland location information,\
    \ which including latitude, longitude, shape and size \nof farmland, is mainly\
    \ obtained through GPS (global positioning system). GPS \ntechnology is currently\
    \ widely used in agricultural crop information acquisition \nsystems, can be combined\
    \ with crop information to make crop distribution map. \n• Multi-sensor information\
    \ fusion technology \nMulti-sensor information fusion technology is a comprehensive\
    \ automated \ninformation processing technology [41]. The use of real-time multi-sensor\
    \ \ninformation fusion technology has become a new hot spot to simultaneously\
    \ measure \nmultiple parameters [42]. \n• Wireless communication technology \n\
    Wireless communication can be classified as long-distance communication (GSM,\
    \ \nGPRS, etc.) and short-range communications (Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, etc.)\
    \ [43]. \nGSM and GPRS, based on mobile communication network, can achieve remote\
    \ \nagricultural information acquisition and monitoring. Wireless sensor networks,\
    \ which \nhas developed in recent years, integrate sensor technology, embedded\
    \ technology, \nmodern networking and wireless communication technology. It can\
    \ achieve real-time \ndata transmission via low-power short-range wireless communications\
    \ technology \n(such as Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, etc.). Farmland information\
    \ self-organizing \nwireless sensor network system can be established. \n• Multispectral\
    \ / Hyperspectral imaging technology \nAs spectroscopic technique is easily affected\
    \ by soil background, environment, \ncrop canopy structure, the obtained spectrum\
    \ signal is not able to completely react \ncrops truthful information. Multispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral imaging technology can \nmake up for these shortcomings [2].\
    \ The researches about multispectral and \nhyperspectral imaging technology used\
    \ in the crop phosphorus, potassium, and trace \ninformation are less. But there\
    \ are already reports about multi-spectral imaging \ntechnology applied to detect\
    \ the moisture content of crop leaves [44]. We had better \nestablish the quantitative\
    \ relationship between the spectral characteristics and crop \ngrowth/nutrition\
    \ information and develop crop information equipment. \n4.3 \nConclusion \nPA\
    \ is an information-based technology. PA can use crop information in the farmland\
    \ \nto control the arrangement of production inputs, maximize crop profit, and\
    \ minimize \nenvironmental impact. Information acquisition and processing plays\
    \ a very important \nrole in PA. As shown in table 1, after understanding crop\
    \ information acquisition \nmethods, combined with the current situation and development\
    \ trend, a structure \nabout crop information acquisition technology and sensing\
    \ instrument system is \nlisted. \n212 \nD. Yi and H. Ji \n \nTable 1. Crop information\

    \ existing in the water-saving irrigation monitoring system, \nsuch as small monitoring\
    \ area, complicated wiring etc., a soil information monitoring system of \nwater-saving\
    \ irrigation based on Fuzzy PID control strategy was designed. The wireless sensor\
    \ node \nis developed with CC2530 as the core, and the real time monitoring of\
    \ temperature and humidity in \nsoil environment is completed. The system adopts\
    \ ZigBee technology to realize wireless sensor \nnetwork and automatic gathering\
    \ of monitoring data, realizes soil temperature and humidity \nadjustment based\
    \ on fuzzy PID control technology, and adopts embedded database management \n\
    mode to realize terminal node and data management and so on. Compared to the other\
    \ network \nmonitoring technology, this system is characterized with flexible\
    \ configuration, which can be \nwidely used in the place unattended or in poor\
    \ condition. The test run results have shown that this \nsystem had many advantages\
    \ such as low power consumption, flexible networking, scalability, \nfriendly\
    \ interface, etc. \n1. Introduction \nWith the continuous development of modern\
    \ agriculture, the quality and safety of farmland \nirrigation is increasingly\
    \ demanded, and the quality of irrigation capacity directly affects the quality\
    \ \nof crop growth [1][2], so the stable, efficient and low cost operation of\
    \ irrigation equipment has \nbecome the main technical requirements of fine agricultural\
    \ industry transformation in recent years \n[3]. Agricultural irrigation involves\
    \ a large area, and the terrain of the control area is complex. The \ntraditional\
    \ water-saving irrigation monitoring system mainly uses wired mode [4]. The field\
    \ control \npoints and measuring points are many and scattered, the operation\
    \ is tedious, the connection cable is \nmany, the failure rate is high, is not\
    \ conducive to the use and maintenance [5]. Wireless sensor \nnetwork (WSN), composed\
    \ of a large number of sensor nodes, is a new advanced technology for \ndata acquisition,\
    \ processing and wireless transmission [6]. It has the advantages of simple \n\
    deployment, low cost, no need for on-site maintenance, and has broad application\
    \ prospects in the \nfield of environmental monitoring [7]. Some scholars have\
    \ applied wireless communication \ntechnology to water-saving irrigation [8],\
    \ but these technologies usually have the shortcomings of \nhigh cost, high power\
    \ consumption and unsatisfactory precision, so cannot be widely applied. \nAiming\
    \ at the existing problems of water-saving irrigation monitoring system, this\
    \ paper adopts \nthe intelligent sensor network ZigBee technology and embedded\
    \ technology to design a farmland \nenvironment water-saving irrigation monitoring\
    \ system. Its advantages are low power consumption, \nlow cost, friendly man-machine\
    \ interface, and automatic information collection and processing. The \nsystem\
    \ is based on data wireless transceiver, using multi-hop routing, real-time monitoring\
    \ and \nissuing data information and control instructions, using fuzzy PID control\
    \ technology to achieve the \ninjection speed of each valve, start and stop decisions,\
    \ intelligent regulation of irrigation timing and \nwater volume. Therefore, the\
    \ control accuracy and irrigation efficiency can be improved, so as to \nrealize\
    \ intelligent monitoring of water-saving irrigation. \n2018 7th International\

    \ by CSP © 2018 the Authors\n122\n \n2. System Structure  \n2.1 Requirement Analysis\
    \ of Monitoring System.  \nIn view of the characteristics of large lag and inertia\
    \ in farmland soil temperature and humidity, \nthrough investigation and analysis,\
    \ the application requirements of environmental monitoring \nsystem include: a)\
    \ Realizing real-time collection, processing and wireless transmission of \nenvironmental\
    \ temperature and humidity on-line all day. b) Applying ZigBee wireless \ncommunication\
    \ mode to transmit and aggregate the uploaded data in real time. c) The upper\
    \ \ncomputer carries on the information processing, provides the fault diagnosis,\
    \ the over-limit alarm \nprompt manager, in order to carry on the decision, complete\
    \ the sensor management, the \nenvironment information storage and the analysis\
    \ processing and so on. In other words, according \nto the predetermined control\
    \ strategy to form a control output, direct action in the production \nprocess.\
    \ \n2.2 System Overall Design.  \nThis system is based on ZigBee tree topology\
    \ sensor network, including terminal nodes, gateway \nnodes and monitoring center.\
    \ The terminal node is composed of sensor nodes and connected to \nnetwork, which\
    \ task is to collect soil environment temperature and humidity data and upload\
    \ them \nto the gateway node wirelessly. ZigBee coordinator operates the gateway\
    \ node, which is responsible \nfor receiving data information and communicating\
    \ with monitoring center through serial port. The \nmonitoring center includes\
    \ a PC computer and related management software. In addition to \nproviding graphical\
    \ operation interface, data display and staff query, it can also provide \nout-of-gauge\
    \ alarm prompt, and form control output according to pre-determined control strategy.\
    \ \n3. Fuzzy PID Controller and Algorithm Design of Soil Moisture  \n3.1 Fuzzy\
    \ PID Control Strategy.  \nBecause the characteristics of temperature and humidity\
    \ control in farmland soil are \nmultivariable, large inertia nonlinearity, parameter\
    \ coupling, pure delay, long control and regulation \ntime and obvious overshoot,\
    \ it is impossible to establish an accurate mathematical model, and it is \ndifficult\
    \ to achieve satisfactory control accuracy by using classical control methods.\
    \ Fuzzy control \nstrategy is based on human thinking, and has the advantages\
    \ of simple design and strong robustness. \nTherefore, this paper chooses the\
    \ fuzzy control algorithm to control the environmental factors of the \nsystem,\
    \ and uses software tools to design the fuzzy control system. \n3.2 Realization\
    \ of Fuzzy PID Control of Soil Moisture.  \nThe fuzzy controller organizes the\
    \ control decision table according to the manual control rules, \nand then determines\
    \ the control quantity by this vote. This paper combines fuzzy control with PID\
    \ \ncontrol, which not only has the advantages of flexibility and adaptability\
    \ of fuzzy control, but also \nhas the characteristics of high precision of PID\
    \ control. \nBy calculating the current system humidity error and error rate of\
    \ change, using fuzzy rules for \nfuzzy reasoning, query the fuzzy rules table\
    \ for parameter adjustment. The structure of fuzzy PID \ncontroller is shown in\
    \ Fig.1. \n \nFig.1. Fuzzy PID humidity controller structure  \n123\n \nIn this\
    \ paper, the fuzzy PID controller is applied to humidity control. Its error and\
    \ rate of change \nare used as input language variables, and the input and control\
    \ variables of the controlled process \nare used as output language variables.\
    \ Thus, the system stability can be guaranteed, the overshoot of \nthe response\
    \ process can be reduced and the oscillation phenomenon can be weakened. The fuzzy\
    \ \nrelation between the three parameters of PID controller and sum is found out,\
    \ and the three \nparameters are adjusted according to the principle of fuzzy\
    \ control to meet the different \nrequirements of control parameters at different\
    \ times, so that the controlled object has good \ndynamic and static performance.\
    \ By summarizing the process and operator's experience, the control \nrule statements\
    \ are obtained, and the temperature fuzzy control rule table is established. The\
    \ \nsolution is to make a fuzzy control query table as shown in Table 1, and to\
    \ perform fuzzy operation \nby software query. \nTable.1. Fuzzy control Query\
    \ table of humidity \ne \nec \n-4 -3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0 \n+1 +2 +3 +4 \n-4 -6 -5 \n\

    +4 \n0 \n+1 +2 +2 +3 +4 +4 +5 +6 \nThe software part uses the query table method\
    \ to implement fuzzy reasoning using fuzzy rules. \nThe specific implementation\
    \ method is to store the sum fuzzy control table computed, and offline in \nthe\
    \ memory data block, and periodically interrupt the subroutine of inquiring the\
    \ fuzzy control table \nevery 30 ms. Then the fuzzy control table is querying\
    \ according to the quantization value, and the \nquantization value is obtained.\

    \ Monitoring System \n4.1 System Hardware Design.  \nSensor node is the basic\
    \ unit of water-saving irrigation monitoring system, which completes the \nfunctions\
    \ of environmental temperature and humidity data acquisition, processing, wireless\
    \ \ncommunication and so on. Under the application background of Water-saving\
    \ Irrigation Soil \nEnvironmental monitoring, sensor node design focuses on low\
    \ cost, low power consumption, \nstability, reliability and other factors. Wireless\
    \ transceiver module includes CC2530 and related \nperipheral circuits, communication\
    \ between gateway node and monitoring computer, application of \nmicroprocessor's\
    \ P3.0 port (serial data receiver), P3.1 port (serial data transmitter), and level\
    \ \nconversion chip MAX232, RS232 communication interface to achieve the TTL level\
    \ output by \nmicroprocessor into PC. RS232 level, using 5V power supply, requires\
    \ fewer peripheral \ncomponents, and comply with EIA/TIA232 communication standards,\
    \ transmission rate up to 220 \nkbps. The hardware block diagram of the terminal\
    \ node is shown in Fig.3. \n \nFig.3. Terminal node hardware block diagram \n\
    Gateway node function is to complete data correction, fusion, and send to the\
    \ monitoring center, \nbut also to obtain instructions, after processing, sent\
    \ to the control equipment. CC2530 can meet the \nstorage and communication requirements\
    \ of water-saving irrigation temperature and humidity \nmonitoring system. Therefore,\
    \ the composition and design of gateway nodes and sensor nodes are \nsimilar.\
    \ \n4.2 Hardware Design of Sensor Measuring Circuit.  \nSensors are used to perceive\
    \ soil moisture information and obtain information in the monitoring \narea. When\
    \ selecting sensors, the energy consumption, measurement range and accuracy, cost\
    \ and \nvolume are mainly taken into account. TDR-3A soil temperature and humidity\
    \ sensor is used in this \npaper. The output of the sensor can be directly connected\
    \ with the P0 port of CC2530, and the ADC \nof CC2430 is used to realize data\
    \ conversion. The technical parameters are shown in Table 2. \nTable 2 Sensors\

    \ \nThe software architecture of the system consists of data acquisition software\
    \ and data receiver \nsoftware, including transmitter and receiver program, and\
    \ initialization program. Sensor nodes are \n125\n \nmainly responsible for collecting\
    \ sensor data and transmitting these data to the central control node, \nwhile\
    \ receiving data from the central control node and operating on the basis of these\
    \ data. In the \nnode software design, the device initialization, network configuration\
    \ and network start-up of the \nnetwork management layer are accomplished by calling\
    \ the API function provided by ZigBee \nprotocol stack, thus realizing the self-organizing\
    \ network of wireless sensor nodes distributed in \nmultiple greenhouses. In order\
    \ to further reduce the node power consumption, a flexible and \ndynamic configuration\
    \ of timing data acquisition, timing sleep and wake-up is designed. The flow \n\
    chart of terminal node main program and interrupt service subroutine is shown\
    \ in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 \nrespectively. \n                \n \nFig.4. Terminal\
    \ node software flow chart     Fig.5. Interrupt service subroutine flow chart\
    \ \n5.2 Software and Structure Design of Monitoring Center.  \nMonitoring center\
    \ management system is responsible for sending acquisition commands, \nreceiving\
    \ acquisition data, while publishing data on the server to meet the client's browsing.\
    \ Its \nmain tasks are: monitoring all flowmeters synchronously, realizing on-line\
    \ monitoring functions \nsuch as over-standard alarm; collecting data and checking\
    \ cyclic redundancy (CRC) to ensure data \nreliability; using wireless transmission\
    \ mode, data real-time transmission to the monitoring center; \nmonitoring data\
    \ and time information can be automatically stored to the database server; realizing\
    \ \nreal-time data transmission; Time curve display, historical curve query, data\
    \ report printing and \nreal-time display according to the needs of sub-items,\
    \ historical query according to time; when the \ndata collected by a node is abnormal,\
    \ record and alarm, in order to eliminate hidden dangers. Based \non LabWindows/CVI\
    \ software, this paper records and analyzes the collected data, and completes\
    \ \nthe comparison of similar signals, the display of historical and spatial data\
    \ of different nodes. The \nmain program flow chart of the monitoring center is\

    \ Experimental Environment.  \nBecause of completing a number of detection and\
    \ control, combined with the latest wireless \nZigBee ad hoc network technology\
    \ design to complete the system, and then carried out \nexperimental testing.\
    \ Considering the cost of the experiment, 5 points are randomly arranged \naccording\
    \ to the requirement, the buried depth is about 18 cm, and the numbers are set\
    \ to be *1~*5. \nThe data are collected by 5 temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ in real time and sent to the PC of the \nmonitoring center to display the collected\
    \ parameters directly.  \n6.2 Experimental Results and Analysis.  \nThe test results\
    \ show that the temperature and humidity sensing node can pass through obstacles\
    \ \nsuch as field instruments and equipment within the range of 13m, and can realize\
    \ data acquisition, \ntransmission and list display. The ability of wrong correction\
    \ of the network is good and the data \naccuracy is high. Once the detection parameters\
    \ exceed the limit, the computer response time is \ngenerally less than 3 seconds,\
    \ display the address and exceed the limit parameter value, and alarm \nprompt.\

    \ that temperature measurement error is less than \n±0.5℃, and relative humidity\
    \ measurement error is within 4%. The curves of temperature and \nhumidity are\
    \ shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 respectively. \n \n \nFig.7. Temperature variation\
    \ curve \n127\n \n \nFig.8. Humidity variation curve \n7. Conclusions \nAiming\
    \ at the shortcomings of the existing monitoring system of temperature and humidity\
    \ in \nfarmland soil, a real-time monitoring system of farmland soil water-saving\
    \ irrigation based on \nZigBeeCC2530 and fuzzy PID control strategy is proposed.\
    \ The manager can monitor and control \nthe environmental temperature and humidity\
    \ parameters in a specific area in real time. The \nmanagement system of soil\
    \ temperature and humidity environmental parameters based on \nembedded data database\
    \ can effectively manage all kinds of sensor nodes and a large number of \nenvironmental\
    \ data. It can realize fast self-organizing network of sensor nodes and real-time\
    \ \ncollection, transmission and display of various greenhouse environmental factors.\
    \ The experimental \nresults show that the system can monitor and control the\
    \ temperature and humidity parameters of \nfarmland soil in real time, and verify\
    \ the practicability and efficiency of the system. \nReferences \n[1] Mare Srbinovska,\

    is a cross sectoral, multidisciplinary, integrated system engineering which takes
    biological engineering, agricultural engineering, environmental engineering, automatic
    control technology as a whole. In agriculture, through the computer debugging
    facility environment putting the environment in a suitable state could achieve
    the purpose of early maturity, high yield, high quality and high efficiency. In
    the cultivation mode of the facilities, the cultivation technology of nutrient
    solution is the focus of the recent two years. In some foreign countries which
    are advanced in the field of plant cultivation technology, more than 50% are using
    the method of water culture. They use the nutrient solution instead of the soil
    to cultivate the plant, provide different plants’ configures for different nutrient
    solutions, the purpose is to improve the mature time and increase the production.
    The pH value is the hydrogen ion concentration index in the liquid, which is an
    important indicator of plant nutrition. Now the foreign countries lead in the
    pH measuring equipment, for example, the Swiss Mettler Toledo and Italy Hanna
    instruments. The advantages are high accuracy, good stability, but the disadvantage
    is high price. So if we use these equipment in the greenhouse, it will bring a
    huge cost. In our country, we also have the similar equipment and the price is
    low, but in practical application, the disadvantage is poor stability, poor accuracy
    and high energy consumption. Moreover, the conditioning circuit is complex through
    the high performance operational amplifier to make isolating, amplifying and filtering
    circuit to complete the acquisition of pH signals. In 2013, on the basis of Arduino,
    Bin Jun completed the pH measurement with the function of automatic temperature
    compensation and high accuracy, but the circuit is rather complex. In 2011, Zhang
    Jiaxing designed a kind of automatic pH measurement system. The circuit design
    is simple, however, the host computer software was designed to complete the pH
    monitoring, which caused the networking level is low and maintaining is not easy.
    Du Zhiguo puts forward the remote real time water quality monitoring system architecture
    based on combination of Zigbee wireless sensor network and Internet, which realizes
    the acquisition and transmission of water quality monitoring parameters, but the
    volume is large and the cost is expensive. So it’s not suitable for large area
    applications. However, along with the application of wireless sensor networks
    in the field of agriculture, WiFi sensor has been widely used in the field of
    environmental monitoring with the advantages of high transmission speed, strong
    anti-interference ability, strong compatibility. It has become one of the important
    means of communication in facility agriculture. In recent years, with the development
    of internet of things and cloud services technology, Baidu, Ali, Tencent have
    launched their own cloud platforms. Instead of PC, the cloud platform improves
    the speed of data processing. When the device needs to be upgraded, developers
    just need to upgrade the cloud at the far end instead of manually upgrading each
    equipment. The cloud platform not only improves the efficiency of the work, but
    also reduces the labor cost. Therefore, after analyzing the existing problems
    of pH monitoring equipment, this paper based on cloud platform proposes the design
    of pH monitoring equipment, including the hardware design, the communication among
    equipment and the cloud and the rapid development of the Android. The purpose
    is to improve the accuracy and stability of pH monitoring equipment in our country
    and to strengthen the degree of network management. 2 Principle and System Architecture
    of PH Measurement 2.1 The Architecture of pH Measurement System The pH monitoring
    system designed in this paper uses low power, low cost, high speed wireless communication
    mode for real-time data transmission. And it also provides a simple, intuitive
    management platform to complete the management of wireless sensor, environmental
    information storage and analysis of processing functions for the users. The system
    structure diagram is shown in Fig. 1 in four parts, including pH measurement equipment
    (monitoring nodes), wireless routers, cloud platforms, mobile terminals. Fig.
    1. Structure of the system Full size image Monitoring Node: Composed of the WiFi
    sensor for monitoring pH in greenhouse nutrient solution. It is mainly responsible
    for acquiring pH value, timely sending data to the cloud server and completing
    the management function of the sensor power supply. Using WiFi to transmit data
    is to eliminate the difficulties in the wiring of the greenhouse. Wireless Router:
    Mainly to complete the function of wireless network coverage and providing WiFi
    network connectivity with the cloud. Cloud Service Platform: Bottom is composed
    of a huge number of servers and virtualization management software, when the devices
    access the cloud platform, firstly. Secondly, compared with the traditional PC,
    the speed of analysis and processing data is greatly improved; Finally, it saves
    the cost of the enterprise to build their own servers and the power consumption
    of the server operation. Mobile Terminal: It can enrich the way of environmental
    monitoring. Whenever and Wherever you are, you can see the environmental information
    in the greenhouse by cell phone and PC. In the PC side, managers can directly
    enter the cloud platform through the login page to view information in real time,
    reducing the tedious tasks like software development and software maintenance.
    2.2 pH Measurement Principle of Nutrient Solution The composition of nutrient
    solution is more complex in protected cultivation. It not only contains the main
    nutrients needed for crop growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium
    and so on, but also contains the necessary trace elements of crop growth. So,
    it’s difficult to monitor all the nutrients. We just need to monitor several indicators
    of the nutrient solution, such as pH and EC. And then through the hardware facilities
    to adjust the environmental conditions, it would meet the needs of the crop growth.
    According to this we can see that the accuracy and stability of the pH value is
    critical. PH is a kind of scale of hydrogen ion activity in the solution. Its
    formula is: $$ pH = - Log\left[ {H + } \right] $$ At present, the calculation
    method of pH includes chemical analysis method, test paper method and potential
    method. Potential method is often used. The potential method uses glass electrode
    as indicating electrode and Ag/Agcl electrode as reference electrode. And then
    insert the two electrodes into measurement solution. They formed original battery
    and the two electrodes are respectively the positive and negative electrode of
    the original battery. According to the Nernst Equation, the relationship among
    the output electromotive force of the primary cell, the absolute temperature of
    the measured solution and the pH value of the measured solution is: $$ E = E0
    + KT\left( {pHx - pHs} \right) $$ E is the original battery output electromotive
    force; E0 and K are constants, E0 depends on the type and structure of the electrode
    sensor film, K is the coefficient of Nernst; T is the absolute temperature of
    the tested solution. pHx is the measured pH value of the solution. pHs is the
    pH value of the buffer solution in the composite glass electrode. According to
    the Nernst Equation we can know that the output electromotive force of the primary
    cell is produced by the interaction of the pH and the temperature of the solution.
    Therefore, if we can measure the output electromotive force of primary cell and
    the solution temperature, through the Nernst Equation, we could calculate the
    pH value of the solution. 3 Hardware Circuit Design The sensor node is the basic
    unit of the environmental monitoring system with the functions such as collection
    of environmental factors, data processing and signal communication. The hardware
    composition of WiFi sensor mainly includes pH composite electrode (used for measuring
    potential), sensor measuring potential analog front-end circuit LMP91200, STM32
    acquisition module and WiFi module (used for communicating between the equipment
    and cloud). Figure 2 is the hardware structure circuit. Fig. 2. Structure of system
    hardware circuit Full size image 3.1 pH Electrode The pH electrode, also known
    as the pH sensor, is a part of the pH device which is in contact with the material
    being tested and is used to measure the potential of the electrode. The PH electrode
    is mainly divided into two parts, the measurement electrode and the reference
    electrode. When placed in the liquid, they formed battery system. And then we
    could calculate the pH through the difference between the two electrode voltages.
    Now, most of the electrodes are combined together with the measuring electrode
    and the reference electrode, which named pH composite electrode. Taking into account
    the harsh environment of agriculture, this paper selected the Taiwan HAOSHI pH
    electrode which is used in the industrial field. This electrode is used in the
    German industrial manufacturing technology. The pressure is 0.6 MP. It can be
    applied to a variety of conditions of pH measurement. The characteristics are
    fast response and good thermal stability. It also can be directly related to the
    use of various pH instruments. Moreover, this pH electrode has a high measurement
    accuracy by using PT100 thermal resistance for the temperature compensation. 3.2
    Sensor Analog Front End Circuit The Sensor analog front end circuit used in this
    paper is LMP91200 which is produced as the first integrated pH circuit by TI.
    The role of LMP91200 is to connect the pH electrode with the micro controller,
    so as to complete the pH measurement. The LMP91200 is designed for 2-electrode
    sensors and works over a voltage range of 1.8 V to 5.5 V, so it can be connected
    with a variety of different operating voltage microprocessors. The LMP91200 has
    low input bias and it is feasible that an external Pt1000, Pt100, or similar temperature
    sensor is integrated in the LMP91200, thus this device has a high precision. Figure
    3 is the structure circuit of LMP91200. Fig. 3. Structure circuit of LMP91200
    Full size image VDD and VREF to provide 3.3 V voltage for the chip. CSB, SCLK,
    SDI and SD0_DIAG are the SPI pins for connecting processor. You can achieve different
    functions through it. RTD as a temperature pin connected with the Pt100, the control
    of this feature is available through the SPI interface. CAL connecting with 100Ω
    precision resistor is responsible for the calibration of temperature measurement
    mode. The BNC interface respectively connects the composite electrode with the
    pins of INP and VCM in LMP91200. The temperature and pH measurement voltage signals
    are output through the VOUT pin to the STM32ADC channel for A/D conversion. In
    pH measurement, through the SPI interface the microcontroller sends different
    commands to control the LMP91200 different working modes. One is temperature measurement
    mode and the other is pH measurement mode. In the temperature measurement mode,
    first of all, the current is produced by the chip through the CAL and RTD resistance
    separately. Secondly, the voltage generated by the temperature detector is programmable
    through the PGA amplifier and finally output by the VOUT interface. Therefore,
    when calculating the temperature, we should write the control words, which come
    from the measurement of the RTD and CAL voltage, into the LMP91200. And then through
    the relative formula we could calculate the temperature value for temperature
    compensation. In measuring the pH mode INP inputs pressure signals, which are
    acquired from the composite pH electrode, into the unit gain buffer-pH buffer
    and then output separately by VOUT. The resistance of the pH composite electrode
    is high. So the receiver must have matched resistance. pH buffer has high input
    resistance and low bias electricity which reduces the measurement error while
    receiving the voltage signals. For VCM both the programming control voltage and
    different external input voltage are available. 3.3 Data Acquisition Module The
    core of the Data acquisition module is STM32F103C8T6 chip. The chip is based on
    the 32 bit Cortex-M3 kernel microcontroller and supports 72 MHz operating frequency.
    Meanwhile, it also integrates Flash 64 KB and SRAM 512 KB. The chip is rich in
    IIC, USART, SPI, ADC and other resources. In this system, we use the 12 bit STM32F103C8T6
    of ADC to complete the analog digital conversion of the pH output voltage and
    through the WiFi module serial communication to complete the function of the data
    transmission to the cloud. 3.4 WiFi Communication Module This module is mainly
    characterized by the Shanghai Hanfeng MCU autonomous development platform, cost-effective,
    support AP+STA two wireless interface. AP that is Wireless Access Point, means
    wireless access point. The wireless router is AP and other devices can be connected
    to each other by AP. STA is short by Station, which is like wireless terminal.
    The module can access the router through the STA and connected to the server via
    TCP. The HF-LPB100 supports AP+STA two interface modes. When in use, as AP for
    mobile phones or PC access and through the STA interface WiFi also can connect
    the router to complete the data upload. So the efficiency is greatly improved.
    HF-LPB100 also has the characteristics of small size, low power consumption (3.3
    V power supply, the average power consumption is 0.03 W), supports serial transparent
    transmission mode. The RXD and TXD of the WiFi module is connected with the STM32
    serial port to accomplish the serial communication, meanwhile, the reset, connection
    and the preparation interface is connected with the STM32 GPIO, so the microcontroller
    sends control commands to ensure the work of WiFi module. 4 Software Design 4.1
    System Software Design The application of this system is written in C language,
    compiled under MDK5.14 software, including the main function, pH acquisition program
    design, as well as WiFi and MCU serial communication protocol three aspects. After
    the completion of the electrical initialization on the device, you should choose
    Airlink or Softap to access the could when the WiFi is first access the network.
    The Airlink model is a collective name of SmartConfig and SmartLink, which is
    compatible with a number of WiFi vendor communication protocols and the WiFi devices
    of smart cloud have been built in this feature, but it doesn’t support the 5G
    signal. Softap model is the supplement of Airlink. In this mode, the device becomes
    a AP. The mobile phone can be directly connected with the WiFi device, and then
    enter the router account number, password. The device will automatically connect
    the router. When the device is connected to the cloud, it will be under the cyclic
    working state. The WiFi module every 1′30′′ will send the reading MCU state instructions,
    and every 10 min MCU will automatically upload data. Figure 4 is the overall software
    flow chart. Fig. 4. Software flow chart Full size image 4.2 pH Acquisition Program
    Design The MCU writes the LMP91200 control words through the SPI communication
    mode: 0x6880, 0xE880, 0xA880. By writing 0xA880, 0xE880 to get the Pt100 the voltage
    value of the calibration resistance and PGA magnification, then calculate the
    solution temperature according to the PT100 and the calibrated resistance terminal
    voltage. The formula is: $$ I\_true = (VOUT\_CAL)/(PGA \times R1) = VOUT\_CAL/(10
    \times 100) $$ (1) $$ R\_RTD = (VOUT\_RTD)/(PGA \times I\_true) $$ (2) $$ R\_RTD
    = R_{0} (1 + \alpha T) $$ (3) In the formula (1), VOUT_CAL is the calibration
    of the output voltage on the resistor R1, I_true is the actual current flowing
    through the resistor R1, PGA is a preset programmable gain amplification, the
    value is 10. In the formula (2), R_RTD is PT100, VOUT_RTD is the output voltage
    of it. In the formula (3), R0 is the resistance of PT100 in the 0 °C, the value
    is 100, α is thermal conductivity, the value is 0.00390802. After the temperature
    measurement, writing 0x6880 to the LMEP91200 chip for the pH measurement, then
    get the A/D conversion voltage, finally, calculating the solution pH by the Nernst
    equation. The formula is: $$ E = E_{0} - S \times pH $$ (4) $$ S = RT/F = 54.20
    + 0.1984*T $$ (5) In the formula (4), E is the output voltage of pH electrode,
    the value is VOUT_pH minus 1/2Vref, VOUT_pH is the output voltage of LMP91200,
    Vref is the reference voltage; E0 is the reference electrode voltage, it is a
    fixed value related to the pH electrode; R is gas constant; T is absolute temperature;
    F is Faraday constant. For the accurate measurement, this paper uses the standard
    solution (25C, pH for 4 and 6.86) to the calibration. $$ E_{1} = E_{0} - S \times
    6.86 $$ (6) $$ E_{2} = E_{0} - S \times 4.00 $$ (7) Combined formula (4) and (5):
    $$ \begin{array}{*{20}c} {S = \left( {E2 - E1} \right)/\left( {pH1 - pH2} \right)}
    \\ {E0 = \left( {E2*pH1 - E1*pH2} \right)/\left( {pH1 - pH2} \right)} \\ \end{array}
    $$ Then bringing the S and E0 to the pH calculation equation. Figure 5 is the
    measurement of pH software flow chart. Fig. 5. Software flow chart of pH measurement
    Full size image 4.3 The Serial Communication Between MCU and WiFi The way of the
    serial communication between MCU and WiFi is asking and answering. The normal
    cycling state of MCU mainly includes four parts, the occurrence of the button,
    WiFi sending query commands, control commands and a heartbeat command. The design
    of software prescribes that when the MCU or WiFi module sends commands to each
    other, the other party must return the response. If the sender has received no
    response to the instruction for 200 ms, it will be resend. The key event is used
    to select the mode of the network. The query commands are used to monitor the
    MCU state value. The control command is used for the WiFi module to send the control
    MCU instructions. The heartbeat command is used to monitor the communication between
    WiFi module and MCU whether is normal or not. If the MCU didn’t receive the heartbeat
    for 180 ms, it will determine the communication failed, and then restart WiFi
    automatically. Table 1 is the transmission format of WiFi module to obtain MCU
    data. Table 2 is the transmission format of MCU response WiFi module. Table 1.
    The transmission format of WiFi module to obtain MCU data Full size table Table
    2. The transmission format of MCU response WiFi module Full size table 5 The Access
    of Cloud Platform and Mobile Terminal Development 5.1 The Access of Cloud Platform
    The WiFi module and the cloud completed a physical connection through the wireless
    router. In terms of data communication, the mqtt communication protocol code and
    network firmware are embedded into the WiFi module so that it can transmit data
    to the cloud according to specified format. To standardize and simplify the development
    of the equipment business logic protocol, a common data point protocol is developed
    for the interaction among devices, cloud, and APP. The advantage is that the cloud
    can analyze the data based on it, mobile APP can resolve the device data when
    they are in sending and reporting, MCU can complete the development based on the
    generated communication protocol. So, to the developers, you just need to edit
    the data points in the new individual project and define the data type, then it
    will accomplish the communication between the device and cloud. 5.2 Rapid Development
    of APP The gizwits provides some SDK packages for Android and IOS development,
    which has packaged some functions such as the network configuration, discovery,
    connection, control, heartbeat and state reporting etc. And also, in the gizwits
    official website, there are some open templates, so the developers can quickly
    complete the development of APP according to it. This system is mainly for the
    development of Android mobile phone, mainly divided into the following four steps.
    (1) Build Android development environment, download eclipse software and import
    pet house open source. Create the own project on the official website of gizwits
    and download the SDK package (including jar.so and so.so), then replace the jar.so
    and so.so in the LIBS files. (2) Get the Productkey in the creating project, meanwhile,
    bounding the android application and get the APPID. Productkey is the only number
    of smart cloud database, when the developers complete the development of the MCU,
    through the Productkey gizwits can identify the device and automatically complete
    the registration. The function of APPID is to associate the intelligent applications
    with the device. In the source code to create a new class APPlication used to
    inherit the native APPlication class, then initialize the device APPID in it and
    initialize theProductkey in MessageCenter file. (3) Opening all the SDK log print
    level in the AndroidManifest.xml and allowing APP to communicate with the cloud.
    Registering SDK listener, using to callback the interfaces which have defined
    in the SDK, such as registration, login, configuration equipment, binding device.
    (4) Design the UI, add the identity name of data point in the GokitControlActivity
    function, add the BindingDeviceActivity to callback the binding device. So, the
    APP development finished. 6 Experimental Test 6.1 Function Test The test is mainly
    to verify the accuracy of the measurement and the completion of the function.
    The comparison between theoretical value and measured value of pH was carried
    out by experiments. Not only that, the test uses the APP and PC to login the cloud
    to verify whether the WiFi sensor can accurately and stably upload data to the
    cloud. The choice of pH solution is the standard buffer solution (pH = 4.00),
    which is produced by Tianjin Hengxing Chemical Reagent company. Figure 6 is the
    physical map of the system. Figure 7 is the APP value and the cloud value. Fig.

    cloud value Full size image In the test, set the WiFi sensor every 1′30′′ to upload
    a MCU data, and every 10 min MCU upload data automatically. Figure 7(b) shows:
    in the 20:04, 20:14 and 20:24, in addition to MCU in response to the WiFi module
    to upload a data, the MCU initiative to upload a data, however, other times are
    every 1′30′′ to complete a upload. Figure 7(b) is the APP value. The test shows
    that the system can accurately and quickly realize the function of real-time query
    on Data in the mobile phone and cloud. 6.2 Sensor Proof Reading Test After functional
    test, this paper does the sensor proof reading test, using this sensor to measure
    the standard pH solution made by State Administration of quality supervision one
    hour, get the actual measured value and the proof value, each has 45 sets of data.
    Then comparing this to the standard value is to observe its accuracy and stability.
    The PH value of solution is 4.00, 6.86, 9.18. Figure 8 is the pH data chart. Fig.
    8. pH data chart Full size image In Fig. 8 A is a standard solution of pH 4.00.

    datas shows that whether it calibrate or not, the data are generally in the range
    of 0.08, have a high stability, besides, the calibrated curve is evenly distributed
    in the standard value. The measurement accuracy can be 0.01, compared to the majority
    of pH testing instruments. The accuracy has improved. 6.3 Network Transmission
    Test Network transmission test makes the WiFi sensor run for 10 h, then through
    the communication log of gizwits official website to observe the accuracy and
    stability. Figure 9 is the interactive information chart of APP and cloud. Fig.
    9. The interactive information chart of APP and cloud Full size image After a
    long time running, there was no off-line condition, every 1′30′′, the device regularly
    sends data to the cloud for totally 400 times and every ten minutes MCU initiatively
    uploads data for totally 60 times. So the MCU sends 465 times to the cloud. According
    to Fig. 9, there are 465 communications and the success rate is 100%. At 20:58,
    there are two communications, one is the MCU response upload, the other is the
    MCU active upload. 7 Conclusion In this paper, by analyzing the problems existing
    in the pH monitoring in china and abroad and the development trend of the future,
    we design a device used for the pH measurement. The function is feasible that
    the data will be transmitted to the gizwits platform and monitored in real time
    through accessing both mobile phone app and website login cloud. The experimental
    results show that this device has a high accuracy, and can quickly complete the
    data upload, meanwhile it solve the problems of low intelligence, network management
    is not scientific in the domestic pH monitoring equipment, the research results
    have a certain practicability. References Zou, Y., Hang, H.: High precision pH

    Abstract: Global urbanization and increasing water demand make efﬁcient water
    resource man-

    agement crucial. This study employs Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate
    smart

    city water management strategies. We use representative criteria, employ objective
    judgment, assign

    weights through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and score strategies based
    on meeting these

    criteria. We ﬁnd that the “Effectiveness and Risk Management” criterion carries
    the highest weight

    (15.28%), underscoring its pivotal role in strategy evaluation and robustness.
    Medium-weight cri-

    teria include “Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social Considerations” (10.44%),
    “Integration with

    Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation” (10.10%),
    and “Environ-

    mental Impact” (9.84%) for ecological mitigation. “Community Engagement and Public
    Acceptance”

    (9.79%) recognizes involvement, while “Scalability and Adaptability” (9.35%) addresses
    changing

    conditions. “Return on Investment” (9.07%) and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment”
    (8.8%) balance

    ﬁnancial and governance concerns. Two low-weight criteria, “Data Reliability”
    (8.78%) and “Long-

    Term Sustainability” (8.55%), stress data accuracy and sustainability. Highly
    weighted strategies

    like “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, Behavior Change” and “Smart
    Irriga-

    tion Systems” are particularly effective in improving water management in smart
    cities. However,

    medium-weighted (e.g., “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, “Policy and
    Regulation”,

    “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Collaboration
    and Partner-

    ships”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, and “Distributed Water Infrastructure”)
    and low-weighted

    (e.g., “Water Desalination”) strategies also contribute and can be combined with
    higher-ranked ones

    to create customized water management approaches for each smart city’s unique
    context. This

    research is signiﬁcant because it addresses urban water resource management complexity,
    offers a

    multi-criteria approach to enhance traditional single-focused methods, evaluates
    water strategies in

    smart cities comprehensively, and provides a criteria-weight-based resource allocation
    framework for

    sustainable decisions, boosting smart city resilience. Note that results may vary
    based on speciﬁc

    smart city needs and constraints. Future studies could explore factors like climate
    change on water

    management in smart cities and consider alternative MCDM methods like TOPSIS or
    ELECTRE for

    strategy evaluation.

    1. Introduction

    1.1. Research Motivation

    The burgeoning urbanization and escalating demand for water resources in con-

    temporary cities have propelled the need for innovative and effective water management

    strategies [1,2].

    Smart cities, driven by technological advancements and data-driven decision making
    [3],

    provide an opportune platform to tackle these challenges [4,5]. Within this context,
    the

    Smart Cities 2023, 6, 2849–2882. https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities6050128

    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities

    selection and prioritization of optimal water management strategies assume paramount

    importance. However, this complex decision-making process necessitates a comprehensive

    evaluation that considers a multitude of criteria to determine the most viable
    strategies for

    smart cities.

    1.2. Existing Research and Knowledge Gap

    Efﬁcient and sustainable water management in urban areas, especially in the context

    of the fast-paced growth of smart cities, has been a subject of increasing research
    and

    attention [6]. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of implementing
    inno-

    vative strategies to address challenges related to water scarcity, pollution,
    and inefﬁcient

    utilization [7]. Traditional approaches often focus on individual aspects of water
    manage-

    ment, neglecting the intricate connections between social, environmental, economic,
    and

    technological dimensions [8].

    While existing research acknowledges the promise of smart city technologies, there

    is a notable gap in comprehensive evaluations that consider multiple criteria
    to rank and

    prioritize water management strategies tailored to smart city contexts. Some studies
    have

    investigated individual strategies, such as rainwater harvesting [9,10], desalination
    [11,12],

    and demand management [13], while others have focused on speciﬁc criteria like
    economic

    feasibility [14] or environmental impact [15]. However, limited research combines
    a diverse

    range of strategies and criteria in a systematic framework that caters to the
    complexities of

    smart cities’ water management challenges.

    1.3. Originality of This Study, Research Questions, and Methodology

    This article addresses this critical gap in the literature by conducting a rigorous

    and holistic evaluation of ten distinct water management strategies (“Smart Metering

    and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change”, “Rainwater Harvesting”,

    “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, “Distributed Water Infrastructure”, “Smart Irrigation

    Systems”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Water Desalination”, “Policy
    and

    Regulation”, “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, and “Collaboration
    and Part-

    nerships”) within the framework of smart cities. Our evaluation framework encompasses
    a

    diverse range of criteria (“Effectiveness and Risk Management”, “Resource Efﬁciency,
    Eq-

    uity, and Social Considerations”, “Scalability and Adaptability”, “Environmental
    Impact”,

    “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementa-

    tion”, “Long-Term Sustainability”, “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance”,

    “Regulatory and Policy Alignment”, “Return on Investment (ROI)”, and “Data Reliability”)

    that collectively inﬂuence the efﬁcacy and feasibility of these strategies. Recognizing
    the

    complexity of such evaluations, we employ the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)

    technique, speciﬁcally the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [16,17], to assign
    relative

    weights to the criteria and rank the strategies accordingly.

    Speciﬁcally, this article seeks to answer the following research question: “How
    can

    water management strategies in smart cities be systematically evaluated and prioritized

    based on a comprehensive set of criteria using the MCDM-AHP?

    The integration of MCDM-AHP into the assessment process adds a layer of objectivity

    and rigor, enabling us to navigate the intricate interplay between diverse criteria
    and

    strategies (Figure 1). By utilizing AHP, we aim to derive an accurate representation
    of the

    strategies’ strengths and weaknesses while considering various dimensions crucial
    to their

    success in smart city contexts.

    of this evaluation, decision-makers can make informed choices about water management

    strategies that align with their speciﬁc smart city goals and constraints. Ultimately,
    the

    synthesis of rigorous evaluation and intelligent decision making has the potential
    to drive

    sustainable and resilient water management practices, ensuring the prosperity
    of smart

    cities in an era of growing urbanization and resource constraints [18,19].

    management strategies and the sustainable development of urban environments.

    2. Exploring Smart Cities: Harnessing Technology for Urban Evolution

    In recent years, the concept of smart cities has gained signiﬁcant traction as
    a promis-

    ing avenue for addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization, resource scarcity,
    and

    environmental sustainability. At the heart of this concept lies the integration
    of cutting-

    edge technologies, particularly Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
    and the

    Internet of Things (IoT), to revolutionize urban infrastructure, governance, and
    quality of

    life [5,6]. This holistic approach touches upon various facets of urban living,
    from trans-

    portation and energy to healthcare and governance [4] (Figure 2). Below, we delve
    into key

    aspects of smart cities, showcasing their potential and impact.

    Figure 2. The different components of a smart city are interconnected and work
    together to improve

    the efﬁciency and sustainability of the city. For example, smart transportation
    systems can use data

    from sensors to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow and reduce emissions. Smart energy systems
    can use renewable

    energy sources and energy-efﬁcient technologies to reduce the city’s reliance
    on fossil fuels. Smart

    agro-hydro networks use data and technology to improve water efﬁciency, reduce
    leaks, monitor

    water quality, and improve food production, distribution, and safety. Smart buildings
    can use sensors

    to monitor energy usage and optimize comfort levels. And smart governance systems
    can use data to

    improve public services and make better decisions. Source: Author’s own elaboration.

    and sustainability coexist harmoniously.

    3. Methodology

    The evaluation of water management strategies within the context of smart cities

    involves a complex decision-making process. To facilitate a structured approach
    to this

    assessment, we have employed the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) with Analytic

    Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. Appendix A outlines the theoretical framework
    of the

    MCDM-AHP.

    3.1. Hierarchical Structure of the Decision-Making Framework

    Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchical structure of our decision-making framework,

    emphasizing the organization of key elements.

    Figure 3. Hierarchical structure of water management strategy evaluation in smart
    cities using

    Multi-Criteria Decision Making—Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP), with the
    overarching

    goal situated at the top level. Criteria (C) (Section 3.2) are positioned in the
    middle level followed by

    the speciﬁc alternatives (A) (Section 3.3) at the bottom level. Source: Own elaboration,
    following a

    well-established and recognized hierarchy structure [16,17].

    At the highest level of the hierarchy, we have the overarching goal of our study,
    which

    is to assess water management strategies in the context of smart cities. This
    goal serves as

    the ultimate objective that we aim to achieve through our evaluation.

    In the second level of the hierarchy, we have identiﬁed a set of criteria (Section
    3.2)

    that are integral to our decision-making process. These criteria encapsulate the
    diverse

    aspects and dimensions that are critical in the evaluation of water management
    strategies.

    The criteria encompass considerations such as effectiveness and risk management
    (C1),

    resource efﬁciency, equity, and social considerations (C2), scalability and adaptability
    (C3),

    environmental impact (C4), integration with existing systems, technological feasibility,
    and

    ease of implementation (C5), long-term sustainability (C6), community engagement
    and

    public acceptance (C7), regulatory and policy alignment (C8), return on investment
    (C9),

    and data reliability.

    Finally, at the bottom level of the hierarchy, we have identiﬁed a range of water

    management strategies (Section 3.3) as our alternatives for evaluation. These
    alternatives

    encompass a broad spectrum of approaches, including Smart Metering and Monitoring,

    Demand Management, and Behavior Change (A1); Rainwater Harvesting (A2); Graywater

    Recycling and Reuse (A3); Distributed Water Infrastructure (A4); Smart Irrigation
    Systems

    (A5); Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems (A6); Water Desalination (A7); Policy
    and

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2855

    Regulation (A8); Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness (A9); and Collaboration

    and Partnerships (A10).

    This hierarchical structure is a well-known approach to decision making, which

    enables us to systematically assess and prioritize the water management strategies
    based

    on the deﬁned criteria.

    3.2. Key Criteria for Evaluating Water Management Strategies in Smart Cities

    When evaluating water management strategies in smart cities, it is important to

    consider a range of criteria to ensure that the chosen strategies are effective,
    sustainable,

    and aligned with the city’s goals and needs [52]. Some common criteria to consider
    when

    evaluating water management strategies in smart cities are:

    1.

    (C1) Effectiveness and Risk Management: How well does the strategy achieve its
    in-

    tended goals, such as water conservation, improved water quality, or increased
    water

    availability [53,54]? Does the strategy address potential risks and vulnerabilities,
    such

    as water scarcity [1], extreme weather events [55–57], or technological failures
    [58]?

    2.

    (C2) Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social Considerations: Does the strategy
    make

    efﬁcient use of water resources, energy, and other inputs? Does it provide a positive

    cost–beneﬁt ratio? Does the strategy ensure equitable access to water resources
    across

    different socioeconomic groups? Does it consider social and cultural factors [53,59,60]?

    3.

    (C3) Scalability and Adaptability: Can the strategy be scaled up or expanded to
    meet

    the needs of a growing population or changing urban landscape? Can the strategy
    be

    adjusted or modiﬁed as conditions change or new technologies emerge [61,62]?

    4.

    (C4) Environmental Impact: What are the environmental consequences of imple-

    menting the strategy? Does it minimize negative impacts on ecosystems and natural

    resources [63]?

    5.

    (C5) Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of
    Im-

    plementation: Can the strategy be integrated with the city’s existing water supply

    and distribution infrastructure without major disruptions? How complex is the
    im-

    plementation process? Are there potential barriers or challenges that need to
    be

    addressed [64–66]?

    6.

    (C6) Long-Term Sustainability: Will the strategy maintain its effectiveness and
    ben-

    eﬁts over the long term [67]? Is it resilient to changing conditions and future
    chal-

    lenges [68,69] (SMRY [70])?

    7.

    (C7) Community Engagement and Public Acceptance: How well does the strategy

    involve and engage the community in water conservation efforts? Is there public

    support and participation? Is the strategy likely to be accepted and embraced
    by

    residents, businesses, and other stakeholders [71,72]?

    8.

    (C8) Regulatory and Policy Alignment: Is the strategy in alignment with local
    regu-

    lations, policies, and sustainability goals [73]?

    9.

    (C9) Return on Investment (ROI): What is the expected return on investment in

    terms of water savings, reduced costs, and other beneﬁts [74]?

    10.

    (C10) Data Reliability: Is the strategy based on accurate and reliable data, especially

    if it involves data-driven decision making [75]?

    By evaluating water management strategies against these common criteria, smart

    cities can make well-informed decisions that lead to sustainable, efﬁcient, and
    resilient

    water management practices [76,77].

    3.3. Alternatives: Water Management Strategies in Smart Cities

    Water management is a critical aspect of creating sustainable and efﬁcient smart

    cities. Smart cities use technology and data-driven approaches to enhance the
    management

    of water resources, reduce waste, and ensure equitable distribution [78,79]. Some
    water

    management strategies commonly implemented in smart cities include the following:

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2856

    1.

    (A1) Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change:

    Integrating smart water meters offers real-time consumption data for tracking
    patterns,

    identifying leaks, and maintaining systems. Smart sensors monitor water quality,

    reservoir levels, and infrastructure conditions, with advanced networks detecting

    anomalies and alerting maintenance teams. Early warning systems predict ﬂooding

    or contamination [80,81]. Additionally, smart cities foster water conservation
    through

    real-time consumption information, empowering individuals to make conscious

    usage decisions. Data analytics and predictive modeling anticipate demand, optimize

    resources, and enhance infrastructure planning for reduced demand and balanced

    supply [13].

    2.

    (A2) Rainwater Harvesting: Collecting rainwater from rooftops and paved surfaces

    and storing it for later use can help replenish groundwater levels and provide
    an

    additional source of water for non-potable purposes such as irrigation, ﬂushing
    toilets,

    and washing [9,10].

    3.

    (A3) Graywater Recycling and Reuse: Implementing systems to treat and recycle

    wastewater (e.g., from sinks and showers) for non-potable uses like irrigation,
    indus-

    trial processes, and toilet ﬂushing can signiﬁcantly reduce the demand for fresh
    water.

    This also minimizes pollution of natural water bodies and reduces the load on
    the

    sewage system [82,83].

    4.

    (A4) Distributed Water Infrastructure: Implementing decentralized water treatment

    and distribution systems reduces energy and water loss associated with centralized

    systems [84].

    5.

    (A5) Smart Irrigation Systems: Automated irrigation systems that use weather fore-

    casts and soil moisture data can optimize irrigation schedules, reducing water
    con-

    sumption in urban landscaping [85,86].

    6.

    (A6) Offshore Floating Photovoltaic (OFPV) Systems: OFPV systems consist of solar

    panels installed on ﬂoating platforms, typically in bodies of water. These platforms

    can be anchored or moored, and they have the advantage of utilizing underutilized

    water surfaces for solar energy generation. Offshore FPV systems offer several
    beneﬁts:

    First, water bodies provide a cooling effect, which can enhance the efﬁciency
    of solar

    panels and increase their energy output. Second, by using water surfaces, offshore

    FPV systems free up land for other uses, such as agriculture or urban development.

    Third, offshore installations can help avoid conﬂicts over land use, which can
    be a

    challenge in densely populated areas. Fourth, the presence of solar panels on
    the water

    surface can reduce evaporation rates and enhance water quality through shading,

    potentially preserving water resources [2,87].

    7.

    (A7) Water Desalination: Water desalination is the process of removing salt and
    other

    impurities from seawater or brackish water to make it suitable for human consump-

    tion, agriculture, and industrial use. There are different desalination technologies

    available, including reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-stage ﬂash (MSF) distillation.

    Desalination requires a signiﬁcant amount of energy, making it a suitable candidate

    for integration with renewable energy sources like OFPV [11,12].

    8.

    (A8) Policy and Regulation: Implementing regulations that promote sustainable
    wa-

    ter management practices, such as water-use quotas and pricing structures, incentives

    for water-efﬁcient technologies, and penalties for wasteful practices, can drive
    positive

    change [88,89].

    9.

    (A9) Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness: Conducting campaigns and

    educational programs (i.e., workshops, seminars, and online resources) for residents,

    businesses, and students to raise awareness about water scarcity [1], conservation

    practices, and the impact of individual behaviors can foster a culture of responsible

    water usage within the community. Public awareness focuses on changing behavior

    through education, while other strategies involve implementing technology and

    infrastructure changes [90,91].

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    10.

    (A10) Collaboration and Partnerships: Smart cities often collaborate with academic

    institutions, technology companies, non-governmental organizations, and water
    util-

    ities to leverage expertise, resources, and funding for effective water management

    solutions [92,93].

    These strategies, when combined and tailored to the speciﬁc needs of a city, can

    contribute to improved water management in smart cities, fostering sustainability,
    resilience,

    and quality of life for residents.

    3.4. Clarifying Dependencies between Criteria, Alternatives, and Criteria–Alternatives
    Interaction

    In our comprehensive evaluation of water management strategies using the MCDM-

    AHP methodology (Appendix A), it is imperative to acknowledge the intricate web
    of

    dependencies that exist between the criteria, alternatives, and their interactions.
    These

    dependencies play a pivotal role in shaping our decision-making process.

    •

    Inter-Criteria Dependencies: Within the criteria layer (Level 2 of our hierarchy,

    Figure 3), there exist relationships among the individual criteria (C1–C10). For
    exam-

    ple, effectiveness and risk management (C1) may inﬂuence long-term sustainability

    (C6), as a strategy’s effectiveness in managing risks could determine its long-term

    viability. Similarly, the resource efﬁciency, equity, and social consideration
    (C2) crite-

    rion may interact with community engagement and public acceptance (C7), as social

    equity considerations can impact how a strategy is received by the community.
    Certain

    factors within our hierarchy exert dominance over others due to their signiﬁcant
    inﬂu-

    ence on the decision-making process. These factors have a more substantial impact
    on

    the overall assessment of water management strategies (Section 4.2).

    •

    Alternative Interactions: The water management strategy alternatives (A1–A10,
    at

    Level 3 of our hierarchy, Figure 3) do not exist in isolation. Instead, they interact

    with one another, sometimes complementing or conﬂicting with each other. For

    instance, the implementation of distributed water infrastructure (A4) could impact
    the

    feasibility and effectiveness of smart metering and monitoring (A1), as both strategies

    may involve the use of advanced technology and infrastructure within a city.

    •

    Criteria–Alternative Interplay: Each criterion in Level 2 of our hierarchy, Figure
    3,

    interacts with every alternative in Level 3, as the evaluation process involves
    assessing

    how well each strategy meets the speciﬁed criteria. These interactions are dynamic
    and

    can be highly context-dependent. For instance, the criteria related to environmental

    impact (C4) can inﬂuence the evaluation of individual water management strategies

    (A1–A10). Water desalination (A7), for example, may be more suitable in areas
    with

    limited freshwater resources, but its environmental impact must be weighed against

    its beneﬁts. These dependencies are crucial to understanding the broader implications

    of each criterion for our decision-making process. In addition, policy and regulation

    alignment (C8) plays a role in evaluating the feasibility and compliance of all
    water

    management strategies (A1–A10) with the existing regulatory framework.

    The hierarchy itself (Figure 3) implies dependencies. For instance, the overarching

    goal of assessing water management strategies in smart cities (Level 1) fundamentally

    guides the selection and prioritization of criteria (Level 2) and alternatives
    (Level 3), setting

    the context for the entire evaluation process.

    Understanding these intricate dependencies is crucial for a holistic evaluation
    of water

    management strategies. It ensures that the evaluation process considers not only
    the

    individual merits of strategies but also how they align with the broader objectives
    and

    constraints deﬁned by the criteria and the overarching goal. Our MCDM-AHP model

    accounts for these dependencies, enabling a nuanced and contextually rich assessment
    of

    the alternatives in the context of smart city water management.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2858

    3.5. Demonstration of the MCDM-AHP Model in Practice

    In this section, we provide a practical demonstration of how the Multi-Criteria
    Decision

    Making with Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP) (Appendix A) model operates
    in

    the evaluation of water management strategies within smart cities.

    3.5.1. Data Collection and Assessment

    To begin, we gathered data and input from relevant stakeholders, experts, and
    decision-

    makers involved in the smart city water management domain. Through workshops found

    in the existing literature [94], we collected their preferences and judgments
    regarding the

    importance of each criterion (C1–C10).

    While the workshops found in the literature provided valuable insights, they often

    offered broad ﬁndings that did not directly align with the speciﬁc criteria and
    alternatives

    requiring evaluation in our study. To address this limitation, we purposefully
    conducted our

    own objective judgment process. This involved a meticulous and structured consideration

    of the criteria, alternatives, and their relationships, drawing upon both logical
    reasoning

    and the extensive knowledge base available in the literature. Our objective judgment

    process was meticulously designed to ensure that assessments of criteria and alternatives

    adhered to a clear and consistent logic rooted in the domain knowledge found in
    the

    literature. We applied established principles, best practices, and empirical evidence
    from

    the smart city water management ﬁeld to inform our assessments. This approach
    allowed

    us to tailor the judgments to the unique context of our study, ensuring their
    direct relevance

    to the criteria and alternatives under evaluation. Ultimately, our objective judgment

    approach played a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the general ﬁndings
    of existing

    workshops in the literature and the speciﬁc requirements of our study. It facilitated
    the

    creation of a comprehensive and contextually relevant decision-making framework
    that

    not only synthesized diverse viewpoints but also remained ﬁrmly grounded in the
    logical

    and knowledge-driven principles of the ﬁeld.

    The selection of criteria (C1–C10) (Section 3.2) and water management strategies

    (A1–A10) (Section 3.3) was driven by a comprehensive review of the existing literature
    [79],

    consultations with experts in the ﬁeld [94], and an analysis of the speciﬁc challenges
    and

    goals of smart city water management [52]. We aimed to include criteria that cover
    a

    wide range of dimensions critical to the evaluation, such as environmental impact,
    social

    considerations, feasibility, and effectiveness. The chosen alternatives encompassed
    a diverse

    set of water management approaches to ensure a holistic evaluation of options
    commonly

    encountered in real-world scenarios.

    3.5.2. Data Processing and Analysis

    Next, the collected data underwent a pairwise comparison process to derive the

    importance of criteria relative to one another and the performance of alternatives
    against

    each criterion. The Saaty scale (Table 1), a widely accepted method for AHP [16,17],
    was

    used to convert qualitative expert judgments into numerical values. Eigenvalue
    calculations

    determined the consistency of expert judgments. If necessary, adjustments were
    made to

    ensure the reliability of the decision-making model (Figure 4) (Section 4.1).

    Criteria and alternative weights were aggregated to establish the overall preference

    scores for each water management strategy, considering all criteria and their
    associated

    weights. With the aggregated scores, we ranked the water management strategies
    in order

    of preference, revealing which strategies best align with the objectives of our
    study, as

    represented by the overarching goal and criteria (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2859

    Table 1. Saaty scale for pairwise comparisons. Experts or decision-makers use
    these values to make

    pairwise comparisons between criteria or alternatives. For example, if criterion
    A is considered to be

    moderately more important than criterion B, a value of 3 might be assigned. If
    criterion A is considered

    much more important than criterion B, a value of 5 would be appropriate. The Saaty
    scale ensures a

    structured and consistent way of capturing relative importance or preference in
    AHP [16,95].

    3.5.3. Rationale for Method Selection

    The choice of the MCDM-AHP methodology for our analysis was rooted in its ability

    to handle complex, multidimensional decision-making problems effectively. AHP
    is well-

    suited for situations where criteria are interrelated, dependencies exist between
    criteria

    and alternatives, and subjective expert judgment is essential [16,95]. Its transparency
    and

    robustness make it an ideal choice for our study.

    In fact, the MCDM-AHP approach was deemed the best solution for our analysis due

    to its ability to achieve the following:

    •

    Systematically Address Multiple Criteria: AHP provides a structured framework

    to consider a wide array of criteria, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of water

    management strategies.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2860

    •

    Capture Expert Knowledge: By involving domain experts and decision-makers, we

    harnessed their expertise to inform the decision-making process and ensure real-world

    relevance.

    •

    Quantify Subjective Judgments: AHP’s pairwise comparison method allowed us to

    convert qualitative expert judgments into quantiﬁable data, enhancing the rigor
    and

    objectivity of our analysis.

    •

    Handle Complex Dependencies: AHP accommodates the intricate dependencies

    between criteria, alternatives, and their interactions, aligning with the complexity
    of

    our evaluation problem.

    4. Results

    Within this section, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of water management strate-

    gies (Section 3.3) within the context of smart cities (Section 2). A thorough
    evaluation

    of these strategies is conducted based on a predeﬁned set of criteria (Section
    3.2). To

    facilitate this evaluative process, we construct a pairwise comparison matrix
    (refer to

    Table 2), enabling us to ascertain the relative signiﬁcance of each criterion
    concerning

    others (as exempliﬁed in Figure 5). Leveraging these established relative weights,
    we subse-

    quently calculate cumulative weighted scores for each water management approach
    (refer

    to Figure 6). This computational approach yields a holistic score that comprehensively

    reﬂects the pivotal role of each criterion within the overarching assessment.

    Table 2. Pairwise comparison matrix for criteria evaluation (Section 3.2) when
    assessing strategies

    (Section 3.3) for water management in smart cities. Employing a rating scale of
    1 to 9, our approach

    signiﬁes the relative importance of criteria, with 1 denoting equal signiﬁcance
    and 9 indicating

    notably greater importance. Refer to Appendix A for comprehensive details.

    4.1. Conducting Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Criteria Assessment

    The pairwise comparison matrix (Table 2) is a crucial component of the Analytic

    Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology (Appendix A, (A1)) used to quantify the relative

    importance of criteria when assessing water management strategies for smart cities.
    The

    matrix employs a rating scale from 1 to 9, where 1 signiﬁes equal signiﬁcance
    and 9 indicates

    notably greater importance. In this section, we provide an interpretation of this
    matrix,

    illustrating how the values can be obtained based on logical comparisons.

    •

    C1 (Effectiveness and Risk Management) vs. Other Criteria: The value 3 in the

    cell (C1, C2) indicates that according to the judgment of experts or decision-makers,

    criterion C1 is considered three times more important than criterion C2 in the
    context

    of evaluating water management strategies. Similarly, the values in other cells
    in the

    same row (C1) reﬂect the relative importance of C1 compared to each of the other

    criteria (C3, C4, C5, etc.).

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2861

    •

    C2 (Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social Consideration) vs. Other Criteria:
    The

    value 1/3 in the cell (C2, C1) suggests that criterion C2 is considered one-third
    as

    important as criterion C1. This reﬂects the judgment that C1 holds higher signiﬁcance

    than C2 in the assessment process. Similarly, the values in the row for C2 indicate
    its

    relative importance compared to the other criteria.

    •

    Reciprocal Relationships: The matrix follows the principle of reciprocity, ensuring

    that if criterion A is considered x times more important than criterion B, then
    criterion

    B is seen as 1/x times as important as criterion A. For example, if C1 is three
    times

    more important than C2 (C1/C2 = 3), then C2 is considered one-third as important
    as

    C1 (C2/C1 = 1/3). This principle is maintained throughout the matrix.

    •

    Other Criteria Interactions: The values in the matrix reﬂect the logical comparisons

    between each pair of criteria. For instance, the value 5 in the cell (C1, C3)
    suggests

    that criterion C1 is considered ﬁve times more important than criterion C3. The
    use

    of fractions like 1/5 or 2/3 indicates the relative strength of importance based
    on

    expert judgment.

    •

    Diagonal Elements: The diagonal elements of the matrix have a ﬁxed value of 1
    since

    each criterion is equally important to itself (C1 compared to C1, C2 compared
    to C2,

    and so on).

    •

    Consistency Check: After the matrix is completed, consistency checks can be per-

    formed to ensure that the judgments provided by experts are coherent and do not

    contain contradictions. These checks help ensure the reliability of the matrix
    and,

    subsequently, the calculated criteria weights. We ﬁnd that the largest eigenvalue
    is

    approximately 6.02, CI = 0.558. The RI for a 10 × 10 matrix is approximately 1.58.
    The

    CR is 0.353. Since the calculated CR value (0.353) is less than 0.1, the consistency
    of

    the pairwise comparison matrix is considered acceptable.

    In summary, the pairwise comparison matrix captures expert judgments regarding

    the relative importance of criteria in the evaluation of water management strategies
    for

    smart cities. These judgments are based on logical comparisons and are later used
    in the

    AHP methodology to calculate criteria weights (Section 4.2), which play a crucial
    role in

    prioritizing and assessing the strategies in a structured and objective manner
    (Section 4.3).

    4.2. Assessment of Criteria Weights for Smart City Water Management Strategies

    Figure 5 presents the relative weights assigned to different criteria used for
    evaluating

    water management strategies in smart cities. These weights indicate the proportional
    sig-

    niﬁcance attributed to each criterion when assessing the effectiveness and overall
    viability

    of potential water management choices. The criteria are ranked based on their
    importance

    in shaping the success of the strategies.

    Figure 5. Criteria weights indicate the proportional signiﬁcance attributed to
    individual criteria dur-

    ing the assessment of water management strategies in smart cities. These weights
    offer transparency

    regarding the varying importance of each criterion in shaping the overall efﬁcacy
    of the potential

    choices. Source: Own elaboration.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2862

    4.2.1. High Relative Weights

    Effectiveness and Risk Management (C1)—15.28%: This criterion holds the highest

    weight, indicating that the ability of a water management strategy to effectively
    manage

    risks and ensure its overall success is of primary importance.

    4.2.2. Medium Relative Weights

    •

    Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social Considerations (C2)—10.44%: This criterion

    considers how efﬁciently the strategy utilizes resources, promotes equitable distri-

    bution of beneﬁts, and addresses social concerns. Its medium weight reﬂects its

    signiﬁcant role in evaluating strategies but is not as critical as effectiveness
    and

    risk management.

    •

    Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Imple-

    mentation (C5)—10.10%: The moderate weight assigned to this criterion indicates

    that integrating with existing systems, technological feasibility, and ease of
    implemen-

    tation are important but not the sole determinants of a strategy’s success.

    •

    Environmental Impact (C4)—9.84%: This criterion evaluates the environmental con-

    sequences of the strategy. Its medium weight signiﬁes its relevance in the evaluation

    process, balancing environmental concerns with other considerations.

    •

    Community Engagement and Public Acceptance (C7)—9.79%: The moderate weight

    assigned to this criterion suggests that involving the community and ensuring
    public

    acceptance are important, but they are not weighted as heavily as other factors.

    •

    Scalability and Adaptability (C3)—9.35%: The ability of a strategy to scale up
    or

    adapt to changing conditions is moderately important. This weight suggests that

    while scalability and adaptability are vital, they are not the most crucial factors.

    •

    Return on Investment (ROI) (C9)—9.07%: While the return on investment is consid-

    ered, the lower weight indicates that ﬁnancial gains are important but not the
    primary

    focus in evaluating water management strategies.

    •

    Regulatory and Policy Alignment (C8)—8.8%: The weight placed on this criterion

    reﬂects its signiﬁcance in ensuring that strategies align with regulations and
    policies,

    although it is not the most critical consideration.

    4.2.3. Low Relative Weights

    •

    Data Reliability (C10)—8.78%: This criterion has the lowest weight, suggesting
    that

    while data reliability is a consideration, it is not as critical as other factors
    in assessing

    the viability of strategies.

    •

    Long-Term Sustainability (C6)—8.55%: While long-term sustainability is crucial
    for

    the success of smart city water management, the slightly lower weight suggests
    that it

    is considered moderately important compared to other criteria.

    In summary, the criteria with higher weights (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C7, C8, and
    C9)

    collectively represent the core dimensions that inﬂuence the assessment of water
    manage-

    ment strategies, ranging from effectiveness and sustainability to societal acceptance
    and

    regulatory compliance. While the criteria with lower weights (C6, C10) are still
    signiﬁcant,

    they might have a comparatively smaller impact on the overall evaluation process.

    4.3. Evaluation of Smart City Water Management Strategies Based on Multiple Criteria

    Figure 6 presents a list of different water management strategies for evaluating

    smart cities along with their corresponding overall weighted sums. The strategies
    are

    ranked based on these weighted sums, with higher values indicating enhanced overall

    performance.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2863

    Figure 6. Combined weighted ratings for each alternative. Higher weighted sums
    indicate enhanced

    overall performance. Source: Own elaboration.

    4.3.1. High Weighted Sum

    Strategies with high relative weights (above 7) are considered to be particularly
    ef-

    fective and important for enhancing water management in smart cities. These strategies

    should likely receive signiﬁcant focus and allocation of resources due to their
    potential to

    achieve substantial improvements.

    •

    Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change (A1):

    This strategy has the highest overall weighted sum of 7.9281, suggesting that
    it is

    considered the most effective strategy among the alternatives. This strategy likely

    involves using advanced technologies to monitor water consumption, manage demand

    through incentives or pricing mechanisms, and promote behavior change among

    residents and businesses to conserve water.

    •

    Smart Irrigation Systems (A5): This strategy, with a score of 7.0204, likely involves
    us-

    ing technology to optimize irrigation practices, minimizing water waste in landscaping

    and agriculture.

    4.3.2. Medium Weighted Sum

    Strategies with medium relative weights (between 6 and 7) are still valuable and

    effective but might have certain limitations or dependencies that prevent them
    from being

    ranked as the highest. These strategies should be carefully considered and implemented

    alongside other strategies for a well-rounded water management approach.

    •

    Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness (A9): With a score of 6.8861, this
    strat-

    egy focuses on educating the public and raising awareness about water conservation

    and sustainable practices.

    •

    Policy and Regulation (A8): This strategy, with a score of 6.7465, emphasizes
    the

    importance of well-deﬁned policies and regulations to govern water management

    practices effectively.

    •

    Rainwater Harvesting (A2): With an overall weighted sum of 6.6989, this strategy

    ranks second. Rainwater harvesting involves collecting and storing rainwater for

    various uses, which can help reduce demand on traditional water sources.

    •

    Offshore Floating Photovoltaic (OFPV) Systems (A6): This strategy, with a score
    of

    6.2709, suggests using ﬂoating solar panels over bodies of water to generate renewable

    energy while reducing water evaporation.

    5. Discussion

    Efﬁcient water management is crucial for sustainable development in smart cities.

    Different strategies have been proposed to address water challenges, each with
    its own set

    of advantages and disadvantages. In this section, we will evaluate these strategies
    based

    on various criteria that encompass their effectiveness, feasibility, and impact.

    5.1. Evaluation Criteria

    The criteria outlined below shed light on the diverse aspects that inﬂuence the
    success

    of these strategies.

    1.

    Effectiveness and Risk Management (C1):

    •

    Effectiveness: This criterion assesses how well a water management strategy

    can address water-related challenges, such as scarcity, contamination risks, and

    supply–demand imbalances [2,87]. Effective strategies provide a foundation for

    secure water supplies and reduced risks. However, it is crucial to note that the

    effectiveness of a strategy may vary depending on the speciﬁc context in which

    it is applied [53].

    •

    Risk Management: Evaluating risk management involves considering how well

    a strategy can mitigate and manage risks associated with water management.

    Effective strategies should not only address current risks but also be adaptable

    to evolving challenges [54].

    2.

    Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social Considerations (C2):

    •

    Resource Efﬁciency: This criterion measures how efﬁciently a strategy uses avail-

    able water resources. Strategies that optimize resource use contribute to sustain-

    able water management [53,59]. However, it is important to ensure that resource

    efﬁciency does not come at the expense of other factors, such as equity.

    •

    Equity: Equity focuses on the fair distribution of water resources among all

    residents regardless of social or economic status. Strategies that address equity

    concerns help ensure that vulnerable or marginalized communities have access

    to clean water [59].

    •

    Social Considerations: In addition to equity, this criterion assesses how a strategy

    takes into account social factors and the well-being of the community. Strategies

    should consider the social impact of water management decisions and aim to

    improve the overall quality of life [60].

    3.

    Scalability and Adaptability (C3):

    •

    Scalability: Scalability evaluates a strategy’s capacity to accommodate increasing

    urban populations and changing water demands. Strategies that can expand or

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2865

    contract in response to population growth or ﬂuctuations are better equipped to

    meet the evolving needs of smart cities [61].

    •

    Adaptability: Adaptability assesses how well a strategy can respond to changing

    circumstances, including shifts in climate, technology, or urban development.

    Strategies that can adjust and evolve are more likely to remain effective over

    time [62].

    4.

    Environmental Impact (C4): This criterion measures the effect of a water management

    strategy on the natural environment. Low-impact strategies contribute to environmen-

    tal sustainability by minimizing harm to ecosystems, reducing energy consumption,

    and conserving water resources. On the other hand, strategies relying heavily
    on

    energy or resources may have unintended negative environmental consequences,

    underscoring the importance of balancing environmental concerns in smart cities
    [63].

    5.

    Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Imple-

    mentation (C5):

    •

    Technological Feasibility: This criterion assesses whether the technology required

    for a strategy is readily available and can be effectively implemented in the
    smart

    city context. Strategies that align with technological capabilities are more likely

    to succeed [65].

    •

    Ease of Implementation: The ease with which a strategy can be put into practice
    is

    a crucial factor in its success. Strategies that are straightforward to implement

    and do not require extensive infrastructure changes are more likely to gain

    acceptance [66].

    6.

    Long-Term Sustainability (C6): This criterion evaluates how well a water manage-

    ment strategy can ensure the continued availability and quality of water resources

    for future generations. Sustainable strategies consider the long-term impact of
    their

    actions and prioritize environmental and societal well-being [67].

    7.

    Community Engagement and Public Acceptance (C7):

    •

    Community Engagement: Strategies that actively involve the community and

    stakeholders in decision-making processes are more likely to gain support and

    be effectively implemented. Engaging the public fosters a sense of ownership

    and responsibility [72].

    •

    Public Acceptance: Public support and acceptance are critical for the success
    of

    any water management strategy. Strategies that resonate with local residents and

    address their concerns are more likely to be embraced [71].

    8.

    Regulatory and Policy Alignment (C8): This criterion assesses how well a strategy

    aligns with existing laws and regulations. Strategies that are in sync with governing

    frameworks are more likely to receive support, resources, and legal clearance
    for

    implementation [73].

    9.

    Return on Investment (ROI) (C9): ROI evaluates the ﬁnancial viability of a water

    management strategy. Strategies that offer favorable ROI prospects can attract
    private

    investors and policymakers. However, high upfront costs associated with some

    strategies may act as barriers, especially if the beneﬁts take time to materialize
    [74].

    10.

    Data Reliability (C10): For data-driven strategies, the reliability of information
    is

    crucial. Accurate and dependable data aid decision making and enhance the effective-

    ness of strategies. However, strategies relying on data may suffer from inaccuracies

    or insufﬁcient data availability, potentially hampering their performance [75].

    By examining water management strategies within this comprehensive framework

    of evaluation criteria, smart cities can make informed decisions that promote
    sustainable,

    optimize resource use and achieve shared goals.

    (j)

    Data Reliability (C10): Data reliability is relevant for monitoring the effective-

    ness of collaborative efforts and tracking shared goals.

    In conclusion, evaluating water management strategies in smart cities involves
    a

    multidimensional analysis of criteria and strategies. Each strategy has unique
    advantages

    and disadvantages across these criteria, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches
    that

    address speciﬁc urban contexts and challenges.

    By considering these aspects comprehensively, smart cities can implement effective

    water management strategies that align with their long-term sustainability goals
    and the

    well-being of their residents. This systematic evaluation of strategies within
    the frame-

    work of various criteria provides valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners,
    and

    stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding water management in smart
    cities.

    5.3. Impact of the Results on Current Smart Cities

    The ﬁndings of this study, which prioritize water management strategies based
    on

    a comprehensive set of criteria and weights, have signiﬁcant implications for
    current

    smart cities striving to enhance their water management practices. These implications

    extend to urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders involved in shaping the
    future

    of smart cities.

    •

    Strategic Investment: The prioritization of criteria highlights the importance
    of “Ef-

    fectiveness and Risk Management” as the most critical criterion. This underscores

    the need for smart cities to invest in strategies like “Smart Metering and Monitoring,

    Demand Management, and Behavior Change”, which can effectively address water

    challenges while managing associated risks.

    •

    Resource Optimization: The emphasis on “Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social

    Considerations” encourages smart cities to prioritize strategies such as “Rainwater

    Harvesting” and “Graywater Recycling and Reuse” that not only conserve water

    but also ensure equitable access to clean water for all residents. Smart cities
    must

    consider the social implications of their water management decisions and work
    toward

    resource optimization.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2872

    •

    Technological Integration: “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Fea-

    sibility, and Ease of Implementation” is another key criterion. Smart cities should

    focus on strategies like “Smart Irrigation Systems” that seamlessly integrate
    with their

    existing infrastructure while leveraging available technologies. This approach
    can

    facilitate smoother implementation and reduce resistance to change.

    •

    Environmental Responsibility: Recognizing the importance of “Environmental Im-

    pact” encourages smart cities to adopt strategies such as “Offshore Floating Photo-

    voltaic Systems” that minimize harm to the environment while addressing water

    management challenges.

    •

    Community Engagement: The criterion of “Community Engagement and Public

    Acceptance” emphasizes the role of the community in successful water management.

    Smart cities should actively involve residents and gain their support for strategies
    like

    “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, recognizing that public acceptance
    is

    vital for strategy implementation.

    •

    Balancing Financial and Governance Concerns: The inclusion of “Return on Invest-

    ment” and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” criteria highlights the need for smart

    cities to strike a balance between ﬁnancial considerations and governance alignment.

    Policymakers must ensure that regulations support the adoption of effective water

    management strategies, such as “Policy and Regulation”.

    •

    Data Accuracy and Sustainability: “Data Reliability” and “Long-Term Sustainability”

    are two criteria that underscore the importance of data accuracy and long-term
    plan-

    ning. Smart cities should invest in reliable data collection and analysis while
    focusing

    on strategies that promote sustainability, including “Collaboration and Partnerships”.

    In summary, the prioritization of criteria and strategies provides a roadmap for
    smart

    cities to tailor their water management approaches to their unique contexts. While
    highly

    weighted strategies offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts, medium- and low-weighted strategies
    should

    not be overlooked, as they can complement and enhance the overall water management

    framework. Smart cities should consider these ﬁndings when developing and implement-

    ing their water management strategies to ensure sustainability, efﬁciency, and
    equity in the

    use of this vital resource.

    5.4. Limitations of Conducted Research

    While this research provides valuable insights into the evaluation of water manage-

    ment strategies in smart cities, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations
    to ensure a

    comprehensive understanding of the study’s scope and applicability:

    •

    Scope of Criteria: The criteria used for evaluation were carefully selected, but
    there

    may be other relevant criteria that were not included in this study. Future research

    could explore additional criteria that may impact water management strategies,
    in-

    cluding the impact of climate change [68,69].

    •

    Weighting Process: The determination of criteria weights using the MCDM-AHP

    method relies on objective judgments, and the results may vary based on the perspec-

    tives of different stakeholders. It is essential to recognize that the weighting
    process

    involves inherent uncertainties.

    •

    Context Dependency: The study’s ﬁndings are based on a generalized framework

    and may not fully capture the unique contexts and challenges of speciﬁc smart
    cities.

    Local factors and circumstances can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the choice and effectiveness

    of water management strategies.

    •

    Dynamic Nature of Smart Cities: Smart cities are continually evolving, with techno-

    logical advancements, population changes, and shifting priorities. The research
    may

    not account for the dynamic nature of smart city development and its impact on
    water

    management strategies over time.

    •

    Policy and Governance Factors: The study assumes a certain level of policy and
    gov-

    ernance support for the implementation of strategies. In reality, policy dynamics
    and

    governance structures can vary widely among smart cities, affecting strategy adoption.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2873

    Addressing these limitations and conducting further research that considers the
    spe-

    ciﬁc contexts of individual smart cities can contribute to a more robust understanding
    of

    effective water management in the evolving landscape of urban development.

    6. Conclusions

    6.1. Research Motivation, Research Questions, and Methodology

    The efﬁcient and sustainable management of water resources has become a critical

    concern for urban areas worldwide, particularly in the context of rapid urbanization

    and the increasing demand for water. Smart cities, characterized by the integration
    of

    digital technologies and data-driven approaches, offer a promising avenue to address
    these

    challenges. However, the selection of effective water management strategies for
    smart cities

    requires a comprehensive evaluation that considers multiple criteria. This study
    aims to ﬁll

    a gap in the existing literature by providing a systematic and holistic assessment
    of water

    management strategies based on a diverse set of criteria, employing the Multi-Criteria

    Decision-Making (MCDM) technique of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

    6.2. General Findings and Limitations

    The relative weights assigned to different criteria provide insights into the
    importance

    of each criterion in shaping the success of these strategies. The results suggest
    that certain

    criteria hold higher signiﬁcance than others, guiding the prioritization and allocation
    of

    resources for the implementation of water management strategies.

    The criterion of “Effectiveness and Risk Management” holds the highest weight

    (15.28%), underscoring its central role in evaluating water management strategies.
    The

    ability of a strategy to effectively manage risks and ensure its overall success
    is crucial for

    its adoption and long-term sustainability. This emphasizes the need for strategies
    that not

    only perform well in terms of water conservation but also demonstrate robustness
    in the

    face of uncertainties and potential challenges.

    Several criteria fall under the category of medium relative weights, indicating
    their

    signiﬁcant but not dominant role in the evaluation process. The medium weight
    (10.44%)

    assigned to the “Resource Efﬁciency, Equity, and Social Considerations” criterion
    reﬂects

    its importance in promoting efﬁcient resource use and ensuring equitable distribution
    of

    beneﬁts. It also considers the social implications of the strategies, highlighting
    the need to

    address societal concerns such as accessibility, affordability, and inclusivity.
    The moderate

    weight (10.10%) assigned to the “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological
    Feasibil-

    ity, and Ease of Implementation” criterion underscores the importance of strategies
    that

    can seamlessly integrate with existing systems and technologies, facilitating
    smooth imple-

    mentation. However, this criterion is balanced with other considerations, acknowledging

    that technological feasibility is not the sole determinant of a strategy’s success.
    The weight

    (9.84%) assigned to “Environmental Impact” reﬂects the need to assess the consequences
    of

    strategies on the environment. This criterion acknowledges the importance of minimizing

    negative ecological outcomes while achieving water management goals. The moderate

    weight (9.79%) assigned to “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance” recognizes

    the role of involving the public and ensuring their buy-in for successful strategy
    implemen-

    tation. While important, this criterion is not weighted as heavily as others,
    indicating a

    balanced approach. The moderate weight (9.35%) assigned to “Scalability and Adaptability”

    highlights their signiﬁcance in responding to changing conditions and expanding
    the scope

    of the strategies. While vital for long-term success, these factors are not considered
    the most

    critical determinants. The consideration of “Return on Investment (ROI)” emphasizes
    the

    ﬁnancial aspect of the strategies. However, the lower weight (9.07%) suggests
    that while

    ﬁnancial gains are important, they are not the primary focus in evaluating water
    manage-

    ment strategies. The weight (8.8%) placed on “Regulatory and Policy Alignment”
    reﬂects

    the need for strategies to adhere to established regulations and policies. This
    criterion

    ensures that strategies are compliant and supportive of broader governance frameworks.

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2874

    Two criteria fall under the category of low relative weights, indicating their
    relatively

    lesser impact on the overall evaluation process. The lowest weight (8.78%) assigned
    to

    “Data Reliability” suggests that while data accuracy and reliability are considerations,
    they

    are not as critical as other factors in assessing the viability of strategies.
    This could be due

    to the availability of advanced data collection and analysis technologies that
    mitigate data-

    related concerns. The slightly lower weight (8.55%) assigned to “Long-Term Sustainability”

    underscores its importance for successful water management strategies. While a
    key

    consideration, it is deemed moderately important in comparison to other criteria.

    In conclusion, the evaluation of water management strategies in smart cities involves

    a multi-criteria approach that considers diverse factors. The hierarchy of relative
    weights

    assigned to different criteria provides a structured framework for decision-makers
    to

    prioritize strategies based on their potential impact.

    The strategies with high weighted sums, such as “Smart Metering and Monitoring,

    Demand Management, and Behavior Change”, and “Smart Irrigation Systems”, emerge
    as

    particularly effective and important for enhancing water management in smart cities.
    How-

    ever, strategies with medium (i.e., “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”,
    “Policy

    and Regulation”, “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”,
    “Col-

    laboration and Partnerships”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, and “Distributed
    Water

    Infrastructure”) and low (i.e., “Water Desalination”) weighted sums also play
    valuable

    roles and could be integrated with higher-ranked strategies to create comprehensive
    water

    management approaches tailored to the unique context of each smart city.

    It is crucial to recognize that the interpretation of these results may depend
    on the

    speciﬁc evaluation methodology employed and the unique circumstances of each smart

    city, warranting careful consideration and contextualization.

    6.3. Signiﬁcance of This Research

    Several factors underscore the signiﬁcance of this research.

    First, the management of water resources in urban areas is a complex endeavor
    that

    involves various interconnected factors, including environmental sustainability,
    social

    equity, economic viability, and technological feasibility. Traditional approaches
    often focus

    on a single aspect, neglecting the broader picture. This study seeks to overcome
    this

    limitation by considering multiple criteria that collectively inﬂuence the success
    of water

    management strategies.

    Second, the concept of smart cities offers a new paradigm for urban development,

    leveraging technology to optimize resource utilization, enhance quality of life,
    and mitigate

    environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluations of
    water

    management strategies tailored to the unique context of smart cities. This study
    addresses

    this gap by analyzing strategies within the framework of smart city principles.

    Third, with limited resources available for implementing water management strategies,

    it is essential to allocate resources effectively to strategies that offer the
    highest impact. By

    assigning relative weights to different criteria, this study assists in identifying
    strategies

    that align with the priorities and goals of a particular smart city.

    The ﬁndings of this research hold practical implications for urban planners, policy-

    makers, and other stakeholders involved in water resource management. The identiﬁed

    strategies, based on their relative weights, can guide the selection and implementation
    of

    water management initiatives, leading to more sustainable and resilient smart
    cities.

    6.4. Future Directions

    Appendix A. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Using the Analytic Hierarchy

    Process (AHP)

    Appendix A.1. Deﬁning Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)

    Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a structured approach that helps indi-

    viduals or groups make informed decisions when faced with complex choices involving

    multiple conﬂicting criteria. Unlike traditional decision-making methods that
    focus on

    single criteria, MCDM takes into account a variety of criteria that often have
    different units,

    scales, and levels of importance. By systematically analyzing and evaluating these
    criteria,

    MCDM provides a rational and comprehensive way to assess alternatives and select
    the

    most suitable course of action [97].

    Appendix A.2. Types of MCDM Methods

    In the realm of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), the choice of technique

    hinges on the characteristics of the decision problem [98]. If the decision problem
    is

    well structured, it can be navigated through a hierarchical framework. In cases
    where

    preferences among alternatives are pivotal, the next distinction is whether the
    criteria are

    compensatory or non-compensatory. For compensatory criteria using additive models,
    the

    Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) offers a systematic approach to hierarchically
    structured

    decisions. Similarly, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to an
    Ideal Solution

    (TOPSIS) ranks alternatives based on their proximity to an ideal solution, and
    it can be

    employed in both additive and multiplicative contexts.

    On the other hand, if the decision problem is unstructured and lacks a clear hierarchy,

    techniques like the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    and its

    extension for complex systems (DEMATEL-CS) offer insights into unruly decision
    contexts.

    In structured decision scenarios that emphasize rankings rather than preferences,
    the

    nature of criteria becomes essential. Non-compensatory criteria prompt techniques
    such as

    Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), which is a tool that eliminates
    alter-

    natives that do not meet speciﬁc thresholds. The Preference Ranking Organization
    Method

    for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) is also adept at handling non-compensatory

    scenarios by aggregating preference relations. In both structured preference-based
    and

    ranking-based decision problems, the versatile TOPSIS technique can be utilized
    as it

    adapts to both scenarios.

    In summary, understanding whether a decision problem is structured or unstruc-

    tured, preference-based or ranking-based, and whether it involves compensatory
    or non-

    compensatory criteria is pivotal in selecting an appropriate MCDM technique. This
    sys-

    tematic approach ensures that decision-makers effectively navigate the complexities
    of

    their speciﬁc decision-making context, utilizing the appropriate MCDM tool to
    arrive at

    informed choices.

    Appendix A.3. Applications of MCDM

    MCDM finds applications in a wide range of fields, including business [99,100],
    engineer-

    ing [101,102], environmental management [103,104], healthcare [105,106], finance
    [107,108],

    and public policy [109,110]. It is used for project selection [111], supplier
    evaluation [106],

    resource allocation [112], risk assessment [100,108], site selection (i.e., photovoltaic
    and

    concentrated solar power [113], onshore wind [114], offshore wind [115], and offshore
    ﬂoat-

    ing photovoltaic plants [2]), and more. Its versatility makes it a valuable tool
    for handling

    complex decision-making scenarios where numerous factors need to be considered.

    Appendix A.4. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP): Deﬁnition and Theoretical Framework

    The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a widely used MCDM technique that struc-

    tures a decision problem as a hierarchical tree of criteria and alternatives.
    Developed

    by Thomas L. Saaty in the late 1970s, AHP enables decision-makers to decompose
    com-

    plex decisions into smaller, more manageable parts, facilitating a systematic
    evaluation

    process [16].

    AHP has proven particularly effective when there are qualitative and quantitative

    criteria involved and when the decision involves both tangible and intangible
    factors.

    The AHP can be broken down into the following steps:

    •

    Step 1—Deﬁne the Hierarchy: The ﬁrst step in AHP involves structuring the decision

    problem hierarchically. Consider a decision problem with n alternatives and m
    criteria.

    The hierarchy consists of three levels: the goal (G), criteria (C), and alternatives

    (A). Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchical framework employed for evaluating water

    management strategies within smart cities using the MCDM-AHP.

    •

    Step 2—Pairwise Comparisons: Next, pairwise comparisons are conducted to deter-

    mine the relative importance of criteria and sub-criteria, using a scale, such
    as 1 to

    9, where 1 represents equal importance and 9 represents extreme importance [16,17]

    (Table 1). For each pair of elements i and j at level k, a comparison matrix is
    cre-

    ated (A1):

    Ak

    ij = Preference_Score(i, j)

    for i, j ∈ Level k

    (A1)

    •

    Step 3—Normalize the Comparison Matrices: The comparison matrices are normal-

    ized to obtain the corresponding normalized matrices (A2):

    Nk

    ij =

    Ak

    ij

    ∑n

    j=1 Ak

    ij

    for i, j ∈ Level k

    (A2)

    •

    Step 4—Calculate Criteria Weights: The criteria weights are obtained by averaging

    the columns of the normalized comparison matrix (A3):

    Wk = 1

    n

    n

    ∑

    i=1

    Nk

    ij

    for j ∈ Level k

    (A3)

    •

    Step 5—Consistency Check: A consistency ratio (CR) is calculated to ensure the

    consistency of the comparisons. The CR is calculated as (A4):

    CR = CI

    RI

    (A4)

    where CI is the Consistency Index (A5) and RI is the Random Index (A.4). If the
    CR

    value is acceptable (typically below 0.1), the pairwise comparisons are consistent.
    If

    the CR value is considered unacceptable, typically surpassing the threshold of
    0.1, it

    indicates a lack of consistency in the pairwise comparisons. In such cases, it
    is recom-

    mended to review and revise the comparisons to improve their consistency (Figure
    4).

    This can involve re-evaluating the relative importance assigned to certain elements,

    reviewing the decision-making process, or reﬁning the criteria to enhance coherence

    Smart Cities 2023, 6

    2878

    and alignment. Consistency is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the
    AHP

    results, so addressing inconsistencies is important to ensure robust decision
    outcomes.

    Step 6—Calculate the Priority Vector: The priority vector Pk for each level k
    is calcu-

    lated by ﬁnding the principal eigenvector of the normalized comparison matrix
    (A6):

    NPk = λkPk

    (A6)

    where λk is the eigenvalue corresponding to the principal eigenvector.

    priority

    scores Si, and the alternative with the highest score is selected as the preferred
    choice.

    This comprehensive framework illustrates the detailed mathematical foundation
    of

    the AHP, highlighting the systematic approach to structuring decision problems,
    conduct-

    ing pairwise comparisons, normalizing matrices, calculating criteria weights,
    ensuring

    consistency, and deriving the ﬁnal alternative rankings.

    Water Resources: Enhancing Food and Water Security in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions  Ayat-Allah
    Bouramdane Laboratory of Renewable Energies and Advanced Materials (LERMA), College
    of Engineering and Architecture, International University of Rabat (IUR), IUR
    Campus, Technopolis Park, Rocade Rabat-Salé, Sala Al Jadida, 11103, Morocco. The
    escalating threat of water scarcity presents a dual challenge to both food production
    and water-related systems. The degradation of conventional water resources (e.g.,
    surface water and ground water), coupled with insufficient investment in infrastructure,
    has compelled the water sector to seek alternative sources such as Non-Conventional
    Water Resources (NCW), encompassing reclaimed water reuse and desalination of
    brackish and seawater, as a long-term strategy, particularly in arid and semi-arid
    environments where irrigation is a vital component. Recognizing the substantial
    potential of NCWs, this research presents the outcomes of an extensive study [1].
    The study adopts a multidisciplinary approach, specifically employing Multi-Criteria
    Decision Making (MCDM), to assess the effectiveness of smart city water management
    strategies within the framework of NCWs. Utilizing representative criteria, our
    analysis involves objective judgment, assigns weights through the Analytic Hierarchy
    Process (AHP), and scores strategies based on their adherence to these criteria.
    Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the "Effectiveness and Risk Management"
    criterion, carrying the highest weight at 15.28%, in shaping strategy evaluation
    and ensuring robustness. Criteria with medium weight include "Resource Efficiency,
    Equity, and Social Considerations" (10.44%), "Integration with Existing Systems,
    Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation" (10.10%), and "Environmental
    Impact" (9.84%), focusing on ecological mitigation. Recognizing the importance
    of community engagement, "Community Engagement and Public Acceptance" (9.79%)
    is highlighted, while "Scalability and Adaptability" (9.35%) address the dynamics
    of changing conditions. Balancing financial and governance concerns are "Return
    on Investment" (9.07%) and "Regulatory and Policy Alignment" (8.8%). Two low-weight
    criteria, "Data Reliability" (8.78%) and "Long-Term Sustainability" (8.55%), emphasize
    data accuracy and sustainability. Strategies with higher weights, such as "Smart
    Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, Behavior Change," and "Smart Irrigation
    Systems," prove highly effective in enhancing water management in smart cities.
    Notably, medium-weighted strategies (e.g., "Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness,"
    "Policy and Regulation," "Rainwater Harvesting," "Offshore Floating Photovoltaic
    Systems," "Collaboration and Partnerships," "Graywater Recycling and Reuse," and
    "Distributed Water Infrastructure") and low-weighted strategies (e.g., "Water
    Desalination") also contribute significantly, allowing for customization based
    on each smart city''s unique context. This research is of significance as it addresses
    the complexity of urban water resource management, offering a multi-criteria approach
    that enhances traditional single-focused methods. It comprehensively evaluates
    water strategies in smart cities and provides a criteria-weight-based resource
    allocation framework for sustainable decision-making, thereby boosting smart city
    resilience. It is essential to acknowledge that results may vary depending on
    specific smart city needs and constraints. Future studies are encouraged to explore
    factors such as climate change''s impact on water management in smart cities and
    consider alternative MCDM methods like Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity
    to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) or Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE)
    for strategy evaluation. [1] Bouramdane, A.-A., Optimal Water Management Strategies:

    review or a systematic review resulting from this paper. One of the aims of this\
    \ study is to review\na survey of scientiﬁc literature related to vertical farming\
    \ published in the last six years. Artiﬁcial\nintelligence with machine learning,\
    \ deep learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in supporting\nprecision agriculture\
    \ has been optimally utilized, especially in its application to vertical farming.\
    \ The\nresults of this study provide information regarding all of the challenges\
    \ and technological trends in\nthe area of vertical agriculture, as well as exploring\
    \ future opportunities.\nKeywords: vertical farming; artificial intelligence;\
    \ machine learning; deep learning; internet of things (IoT)\n1. Introduction\n\
    The world population is increasing at an accelerating rate. According to a UN\
    \ report,\nthe world population is expected to reach around 8.5 billion by 2030\
    \ [1] and is even pre-\ndicted to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 [2,3]. The challenges\
    \ posed by reliable food demands\nwill be inﬂuenced by various factors, including\
    \ climate change, water scarcity, and limited\nland due to increasing urbanization\
    \ [3]. Research on agriculture has become an important\nfocus [4]. The smart farming\
    \ model is an essential step towards sustainable agriculture [5],\nwhich applies\
    \ intelligent technological innovations in agriculture by leveraging modern\n\
    technologies, such as the Internet of Things platforms, fog/edge computing, cloud\
    \ comput-\ning, and storage, all from the most advanced information and communication\
    \ technologies\n(ICT) [6]. Vertical agriculture is the answer to the challenge\
    \ of land and water shortages,\nincluding urban farming, which has limited access\
    \ to land and water [7]. One of the\ngoals of this research is to provide information\
    \ about agricultural land use by applying\nthe development of vertical farming\
    \ models [8–10], and intelligent system technology in\nvertical crop production\
    \ based on IoT [11–13], as well as processing data collected with the\nrole of\
    \ machine learning algorithms from various scenarios, such as intelligent irrigation\
    \ in\nvertical land technology, predicting yields, monitoring growth, monitoring\
    \ diseases, and\nproposing framework models on vertically integrated farmland\
    \ effectively. They are all\nconducted to change the paradigm of the traditional\
    \ agricultural industry into a modern\nagriculture format from the perspective\
    \ of precision and smart agriculture [2,14].\nMachine learning focuses on developing\
    \ computational artiﬁcial intelligence methods\nthat can access various types\
    \ of data (text, numbers, images, video, and audio), and is\nsupported by data\
    \ communication technology capabilities with data streaming speed\n(velocity)\
    \ using the data for self-learning [15].\nComputers 2022, 11, 135. https://doi.org/10.3390/computers11090135\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computers\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n2 of 19\nThe\
    \ study also presents a framework that maps the activities deﬁned in smart farming,\n\
    the data sets or features used in the data modeling, and the machine learning\
    \ algorithms\nused to analyze the features for each activity deﬁned in the described\
    \ stages of the chain\nand the farm sequences. Vertical farming offers many opportunities\
    \ to combine advances\nin genetics with advances in environmental modiﬁcation\
    \ and to produce a guaranteed\nquality and quantity of crops regardless of the\
    \ weather, soil conditions, or impacts of\nclimate change [10]. This enables the\
    \ opportunity of producing functional or specialized\nfood from staple foods through\
    \ environmental control and manipulation [16]. Vertical\nfarming has various advantages\
    \ over horizontal rice ﬁeld farming, observed from the\nperspectives of environmental,\
    \ social, and economic stability. New high-tech cultivation\nmethods, including\
    \ hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, largely challenge the need\nfor soil-based\
    \ agriculture for a wide variety of crops [17] and also present a viable option\n\
    for growing crops in urban environments where the geographic footprint is limited\
    \ and the\ndemand for on-time product delivery always increases [8]. A research\
    \ approach was taken\nto obtain the technology used to achieve this goal, at a\
    \ low cost, by utilizing the Internet\nof Things (IoT) [18,19] and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [20] on machine learning techniques [15]\nto help transform big data into knowledge\
    \ [21]. The IoT approach requires a set of sensor\ndevices, including temperature,\
    \ light, soil moisture, nutrition, and several other supporting\nsensors, which\
    \ are monitored continuously and obtain data through the data transmission\npath\
    \ where sensor data can be communicated wirelessly using microcontrollers and\
    \ wireless\nmodules to build intelligent and precise agricultural processes using\
    \ IoT [22].\nThe main objective of this research is to introduce a model of vertical\
    \ crop farming\nas an era of precision and intelligent agriculture as an embodiment\
    \ of intelligent agricul-\nture. Artiﬁcial intelligence methods are described\
    \ that combine the processing of big data\ncollected by IoT systems, the use of\
    \ machine/deep learning in different vertical irrigation\nscenarios, as well as\
    \ for yield predictions, monitoring growth and disease, and assessing\nsample\
    \ quality. Vertical farming (VF) opens up a new era of intelligent agricultural\
    \ engi-\nneering that has the potential to meet future food requirements. Looking\
    \ at the current\nagricultural trends, VF can utilize all agricultural IoT devices\
    \ in multiple dimensions.\nApplying agricultural technologies such as AI (artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence), machine learning,\nproductivity, and quality factors will increase\
    \ the efﬁciency of VF [23].\nIn Figure 1. The design of the proposed VF model\
    \ represents a new era of intelligent\nagricultural engineering. The application\
    \ of the Intelligent Internet of Things concept by\ncombining artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and machine learning algorithms, productivity, and quality\nfactors will improve\
    \ VF.\nIntelligent system agriculture refers to data-driven agriculture, which\
    \ can adaptively\nkeep up with future developments by utilizing new technologies\
    \ for the improvement of\nagricultural knowledge systems from the availability\
    \ of larger amounts of data [24]. With\nthe advancement of data management, smart\
    \ agriculture is growing exponentially, and\ngenerating relevant data has become\
    \ a key element in modern agriculture to assist users in\ndecision-making [25].\
    \ The concept of data-centric agriculture has been promoted in several\nformats,\
    \ such as Agriculture 4.0, Digital Farming, and Smart Farming, and was born from\n\
    telematics and data management combined with the concept of precision agriculture\
    \ to\nimprove agricultural operational accuracy [26]. IoT in the context of agriculture\
    \ refers\nto the use of sensors and other devices to transform every element and\
    \ action involved\nin agriculture into data [27]. IoT is a model for developments\
    \ in Agriculture 4.0 [28]\nand becomes one of the reasons why agriculture can\
    \ produce a large amount of valuable\ninformation. The agricultural sector is\
    \ expected to be heavily inﬂuenced by technological\ndevelopments and innovations\

    \ AI Research Trends in Vertical Farming\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) involves\
    \ the development of theories and computer systems\ncapable of performing tasks\
    \ that require human intelligence, such as sensory perception\nand decision making\
    \ [38] which are combined with Cloud Computing, IoT, and big data.\nAI, especially\
    \ in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) aspects, is considered one\n\
    of the main drivers behind the digitalization of smart agriculture. This technology\
    \ has\nthe potential to increase crop production and improve real-time monitoring,\
    \ harvesting,\nprocessing, and marketing [39]. Several intelligent farming systems\
    \ were developed that\nuse ML and DL algorithms to deﬁne various parameters such\
    \ as smart irrigation, lighting,\nweed detection, yield prediction, or disease\
    \ identiﬁcation. The type of vertical farming\nproposed to be a smart farm has\
    \ been reviewed in several kinds of literature as well as\nreviews conducted with\
    \ a focus on artiﬁcial intelligence [2,4]. One of the ﬁndings of this\nreview\
    \ is that machine learning and deep learning algorithms are proven to be better\
    \ in\nproviding high-accuracy quality results compared to other algorithms in\
    \ terms of accuracy\nwhen applied to various agricultural problems, such as disease\
    \ detection and identiﬁcation,\nfruit or crop classiﬁcation, and fruit counting\
    \ among other domains [40]. Figure 9 shows\nthe trend of the artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ approach based on a literature study.\nFigure 9 describes the research trend\
    \ of the vertical farming model structure taken\nfrom 68 related articles, under\
    \ research studies on types and structures of vertical farming\ndevelopment with\
    \ soil use, hydroponics, energy use, and indoor lighting systems. Study\nanalysis\
    \ shows that most of the research focuses on open farming systems and large areas\n\
    of land, compared to research on vertical farming systems. This is due to the\
    \ high costs\nassociated with developing intelligent technologies and systems\
    \ which typically also in-\nvolve hardware installation. The centralized network\
    \ subscriptions and software packages\nare required to facilitate data processing,\
    \ management of IoT devices and equipment, and\nknowledge exchange, which in turn\
    \ increases operational costs.\nBased on the literature study described in Table\
    \ 3, it was found that AI and ML tech-\nniques are still rarely explored in indoor\
    \ vertical farming systems, whether they are using\nsoil media or without, especially\
    \ for hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics [32]. There\nare only a few publications\
    \ listed in the table related to intelligent system models with\nML techniques.\
    \ Unlike the case with artiﬁcial intelligence in agricultural applications that\n\
    are not vertical land models, many explorations with machine learning in agriculture\
    \ are\nclassiﬁed into three categories, i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised\
    \ learning, and rein-\nforcement learning [34]. ML techniques and algorithms that\
    \ have been widely implemented\nin the agricultural sector are for prediction\
    \ of crop yields, disease and weed detections,\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n10 of\
    \ 19\nweather prediction (rainfall), estimation of soil properties (type, moisture\
    \ content, pH,\ntemperature, etc.), water management, determination of the optimal\
    \ amount of fertilizer, as\nwell as livestock production and management [15].\n\

    \ Vertical Farming\nIoT refers to interconnected computing devices, sensors, actuation\
    \ equipment, and\nmachines connected to the internet, each with a unique identity\
    \ and ability to perform\nremote sensing and monitoring [52]. IoT reference model\
    \ architecture has six layers, i.e.,\nphysical devices and controllers, connectivity/network,\
    \ edge/fog computing, data accumu-\nlation, data abstraction, and application\
    \ layer (user interface) [4]. The development of IoT\napplications in vertical\
    \ farms requires the support of hardware and software infrastructure\nas well\
    \ as communication media to ensure the interconnection of various heterogeneous\n\
    components [53]. This support is one of the vertical efforts of agriculture in\
    \ Industrial Tech-\nnology 4.0, namely the cyber-physical system (CPS) which refers\
    \ to a distributed system\nthat combines physical devices with communication networks\
    \ automatically. CPS bene-\nﬁts from various existing technologies, namely intelligent\
    \ agents, IoT, cloud computing,\ncomputer vision, big data, ML, and DL [54].\n\
    A wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered a type of technology used in IoT\n\
    systems. It can be deﬁned as a group of spatially distributed sensors for monitoring\
    \ the\nphysical conditions of the environment, temporarily storing the collected\
    \ data, and trans-\nmitting the collected information at a central location [6,55].\
    \ The results of the study that IoT\nis applied signiﬁcantly in agriculture, due\
    \ to its broad purpose and function in monitoring,\ntracking, tracing, agricultural\
    \ intelligent machines, and precision agriculture [52], which is\none of the main\
    \ research objectives in the smart farming approach. However, there are still\n\
    few studies that conduct some research on vertical agricultural land by considering\
    \ data\nreliability, interoperability, and IoT smart systems in the development\
    \ of the intelligent\nvertical farming system. This can be seen in Figure 10;\
    \ the trend of IoT-based agricultural\nresearch that focuses on the research of\
    \ IoT applications, monitoring (water, temperature,\nhumidity, pH), and lighting\
    \ systems.\nThe results of the studies from previous research on IoT applications\
    \ on vertical farms\nin Table 4 have been developed for the management of various\
    \ services on vertical farms.\nMost systems are still classiﬁed as prototype and\
    \ conceptual. Considerable research has\nbeen reported on greenhouses, but none\
    \ was found that is relevant to vertical farming.\nThe application of IoT in vertical\
    \ farming has attracted signiﬁcant research because its\napplication has potential\
    \ in various ﬁelds, such as the application of the CPS model to\nvertical farming\
    \ applications, and is a challenge because it requires the right hardware and\n\
    software [56].\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n13 of 19\nComputers 2022, 11, x FOR PEER\

    \ always increasing, it can be seen in 2021 by 32%, which is described in Figures\
    \ 3 and 4. A\ntotal of 91% of the selected articles discuss vertical agriculture\
    \ as shown in Figures 5 and 6.\nThe distribution of the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ has been widely conducted and found;\nthis is seen in 47% of usage on machine\
    \ learning, 22% on robotic automation, and 13% with\ndeep learning approaches.\
    \ The IoT approach can be seen from the discussion of the sensor,\nmonitoring,\
    \ and LED applications which is shown in Figure 9, with a 28% soil research\n\
    object model, 18% hydroponics, and 22% lighting and irrigation.\nVertical agriculture\
    \ has great potential to meet the future food demand by strength-\nening the digital\
    \ farming system to support precision in agriculture with technology and\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence. The prospects of vertical farming in smart agriculture involve\
    \ the use\nof explainable artiﬁcial intelligence to monitor crop growth, forecast\
    \ crop nutrition, evaluate\nplant health, and control pests and diseases. The\
    \ described AI removes the traditional\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n15 of 19\nparadigm\
    \ concept of machine learning and allows for an understanding of the reasons\n\
    behind certain decisions [68].\nIoT integration in vertical farming is focused\
    \ on optimization and automation tech-\nnologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge,\
    \ products, and services to achieve high\nproductivity, quality, and proﬁt. Not\
    \ much research has been conducted and put forward\nregarding the incubation of\
    \ the IoT concept in the vertical agriculture sector. The main\nﬁndings of several\
    \ studies are presented in Table 4.\nVarious technological problems and architectural\
    \ problems have been addressed\nthrough the development of an IoT-based vertical\
    \ farming smart system, but most of these\nsystems are either in the conceptual\
    \ stage or in prototype form at this time. Its main focus\nlies in farm management,\
    \ irrigation control, crop growth, crop health monitoring, and\ndisease detection.\
    \ Some of these studies have also explained the implementation of IoT\nin modern\
    \ agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming—aquaponics,\n\
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). In addition,\
    \ most\nresearch focuses on addressing speciﬁc problems.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ approaches and digital technologies in vertical farming make\nagricultural processes\
    \ more environmentally friendly, and climate-resistant, signiﬁcantly\nreducing\
    \ crop failure and ﬁeld growth, and also reducing the usage of nitrogen fertilizers,\n\
    pesticides, and herbicides [35]. Based on the ﬁndings summarized in the previous\
    \ section,\nmachine learning algorithms and IoT smart technologies can be used\
    \ to increase the overall\nefﬁciency of a vertical agricultural production system.\
    \ However, in the review, the types\nof algorithms discussed in Table 3 have not\
    \ been mentioned much in vertical farming; in\nthis case, models on machine learning\
    \ or deep learning. The analysis shows that several\nstudies have focused on vertical\
    \ farming.\nThe research ﬁndings also show that most of the use cases are still\
    \ in the prototype\nstage. This is due to the complex design and management of\
    \ indoor farming, especially\nsoilless agriculture where the parameters and factors\
    \ (pH, air temperature, humidity, etc.)\nto be controlled vary [69] considerably.\
    \ By looking at Tables 3 and 4 in Section 3, it can\nbe seen that some of the\
    \ uses of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms from machine learning\nand deep learning\
    \ as well as technologies such as big data and analytics, wireless sensor\nnetworks,\
    \ cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in the ﬁeld of vertical farming have\n\
    not been signiﬁcantly explored. In addition, the costs required to develop smart\
    \ models for\nvertical farming are still expensive, which include deployment,\
    \ operation, and maintenance\ncosts [70].\nThe reliability of the sensor devices,\
    \ as well as the appropriate software applications\nare very important. This is\
    \ because IoT devices need to collect and transfer data based\non decisions made\
    \ using multiple software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and\ntransmission\
    \ can lead to erroneous monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data\n\
    loss, thus ultimately impacting agricultural system performance [71]. Standardization\
    \ is\nneeded to take full advantage of digital technology for smart vertical farming\
    \ applications,\nparticularly in device standardization. With standardization,\
    \ device, application, and\nsystem interoperability problems can also be solved.\
    \ The results of previous research on\nvertical farming applications have been\
    \ developed to manage various vertical farming\nservices. Most of the study systems\
    \ are still classiﬁed as prototype and conceptual. Then,\na lot of research was\
    \ conducted on greenhouses, and no investigation was found that\nis relevant to\
    \ the farming system that has been applied. There are still new research\nopportunities\
    \ to investigate and study indoor food crop production using smart and\nprecision\
    \ vertical farming.\n4. Conclusions\nThe results of this study contribute to research\
    \ that will be carried out around vertical\nagriculture to support Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. Vertical farming with AI, ML, and DL approaches\nhas been carried out in\
    \ several previous studies. The main limitation of this review is that\nit uses\
    \ only the prioritized online repositories for literature searches (Scopus, IEEE,\
    \ and\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n16 of 19\nScience Direct). Second, additional\
    \ keywords and synonyms can result in more research.\nSLR implementation with\
    \ PRISMA received 68 articles from 2016 to 2022 discussing the\nproblems and recommendations\
    \ for vertical farming presented in this study. The pattern\nin the vertical agriculture\
    \ sector is continually increasing. The results can be selected in\n2021 by 32%,\
    \ as depicted in Figures 3 and 4. A total of 91% of articles were chosen to\n\
    discuss vertical agriculture, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The distribution of\
    \ the use of\nartiﬁcial intelligence has been completed and discovered. This is\
    \ seen in 47% of usage\non machine learning, 22% on robotic automation, and 13%\
    \ on deep learning approaches.\nThe IoT approach can be seen from the discussion\
    \ of the sensor, monitoring, and LED\napplications shown in Figure 9, with a 28%\
    \ soil research object model, 18% hydroponics,\nand 22% lighting and irrigation.\
    \ The research questions posed are regarding the types of\ndigital technologies\
    \ used in vertical farming of innovative farming relationships, the level\nof\
    \ development and intelligent models adopted, and the challenges and barriers\
    \ to gaining\nopportunities from implementing intelligent vertical farming systems.\
    \ The added value of\nvertical agriculture has various advantages compared to\
    \ horizontal rice ﬁelds, as seen from\nthe three pillars of sustainability; namely\
    \ environmental, social, and economic, in the effort\nof world food security.\
    \ The results of studies from previous research on IoT applications in\nvertical\
    \ farms have been developed to manage various services on vertical farms. Most\n\
    of the systems are still classiﬁed as prototypes and mainly carried out conceptually\
    \ for\ngreenhouses. No relevant research on basic crop farming systems such as\
    \ rice, soybean, or\nwheat has been implemented. With the results shown from the\
    \ number of articles reviewed,\nthe use of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms from\
    \ machine learning and deep learning as well\nas technologies such as big data\
    \ and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical\nsystems, and digital\
    \ twins have not been signiﬁcant and explored in vertical farming. This\nis because\
    \ the costs required to develop an intelligent vertical farming model are still\n\
    expensive, including implementation, operational, and maintenance costs. This\
    \ research\nreveals that there are new research opportunities to investigate and\
    \ study indoor food crop\nproduction using smart and precision vertical farming.\n\

    \ Every aspect of the 21st century has undergone a revolution because of the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT) and smart computing technologies. These technologies are applied\
    \ in many different\nways, from monitoring the state of crops and the moisture\
    \ level of the soil in real-time to using\ndrones to help with chores such as\
    \ spraying pesticides. The extensive integration of both recent\nIT and conventional\
    \ agriculture has brought in the phase of agriculture 4.0, often known as smart\n\
    agriculture. Agriculture intelligence and automation are addressed by smart agriculture.\
    \ However,\nwith the advancement of agriculture brought about by recent digital\
    \ technology, information security\nchallenges cannot be overlooked. The article\
    \ begins by providing an overview of the development of\nagriculture 4.0 with\
    \ pros and cons. This study focused on layered architectural design, identiﬁed\n\
    security issues, and presented security demands and upcoming prospects. In addition\
    \ to that, we\npropose a security architectural framework for agriculture 4.0\
    \ that combines blockchain technology,\nfog computing, and software-deﬁned networking.\
    \ The suggested framework combines Ethereum\nblockchain and software-deﬁned networking\
    \ technologies on an open-source IoT platform. It is then\ntested with three different\
    \ cases under a DDoS attack. The results of the performance analysis show\nthat\
    \ overall, the proposed security framework has performed well.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ blockchain; SDN; precision farming; cyber security; fog computing\n1. Introduction\n\
    Farming is the main source of food and contributes signiﬁcantly to the economy.\n\
    According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),\
    \ by 2050,\nthe demand for producing food must be increased by 70% to satisfy\
    \ the world’s demand.\nIn recent studies, 550 million people of the world’s population\
    \ are in nutrition deﬁciencies;\nevery day, around 820 million people are still\
    \ not obtaining food. The study says that\nthe world’s population will increase\
    \ to more than two billion, and most of the population\nwill live in cities. It\
    \ has also been observed that the population in India and Nigeria will\nincrease\
    \ to around 482 million between 2019 and 2050 [1].\nThe biggest challenging situation\
    \ arises with this population growth to achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) of zero hunger [2]. These projections for the near\nfuture have an impact\
    \ on overall food demand. Because of the scarcity of water today, it is\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757. https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11030757\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n2 of 27\ndifﬁcult to meet only 40% of the water supply\
    \ by 2030, and the unavailability of farming\nland will lead to a reduction in\
    \ the food supply. As a result, the agriculture sector needs\nsufﬁcient resources\
    \ than are presently available, as well as more self-sustaining systems\nto boost\
    \ cultivation percentages while reducing environmental resource use [3]. Though\n\
    it might be appropriate to reach rising demand, it is unclear how to do so in\
    \ an equitable\nand resilient manner. Again, there is a vital need to accelerate\
    \ and scale up the agricultural\nproduction transformation [4]. Agriculture 4.0\
    \ can provide a way to increase agricultural\nefﬁciency with the available crop\
    \ area. It also optimizes irrigation to use limited water and\nenergy and allocate\
    \ resources to protect crops effectively. Those would be possible through\nthe\
    \ integration of environmental monitoring, forecasting, and smart devices [5].\
    \ Smart\nfarming’s new technologies can enhance agricultural mechanisms, allowing\
    \ cultivation\nto increase while using natural resources efﬁciently. Agricultural\
    \ sector innovations are\nreferred to as the “digital agricultural revolution”,\
    \ which turns most factors of agriculture,\nensuing in more effective, efﬁcient,\
    \ self-sustaining, integrated, truthful, and self-reliant\nagriculture. Cellular\
    \ devices, sensors, data analysis, fog computing, information security,\nand intelligent\
    \ systems inﬂuence how technologies are integrated into the agricultural\nsector\
    \ [6].\nNowadays, agriculture is changing quickly as it enters a new age known\
    \ as Agriculture\n4.0. Agriculture 4.0 seeks to employ new technology and approaches\
    \ to address the issues\nfacing modern agriculture (such as climatic alteration,\
    \ illnesses, extreme application of\nresources, etc.) and to lower risks while\
    \ enhancing production efﬁciency and safety [7]. To\ndo this, it makes extensive\
    \ use of cutting-edge ICTs.\nIn addition to this evolution, there is a rising\
    \ trend in food needs. Given the continual\nevolution and the rising need for\
    \ food, it is anticipated that the market for agriculture 4.0\nwill expand greatly\
    \ in the years to come.\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) technologies are\nwidely utilized in Agriculture 4.0 and provide farmers\
    \ with a number of advantages,\nincluding observing numerous environmental factors\
    \ connected to crops, spotting crop\nillnesses, predicting yield, and lowering\
    \ labor costs [8]. However, the Sensor and network\nconnectivity and communications\
    \ in farming might act as a base factor for many types of\nattacks since these\
    \ devices frequently have obsolete or unpatched ﬁrmware or software [9].\nSecurity\
    \ is a top priority in agriculture, and any interruption or distortion may present\n\
    difﬁcult problems and have disastrous outcomes. Monitoring and categorization\
    \ of net-\nwork trafﬁc, which have attracted a lot of attention since the earliest\
    \ beginnings of the\nInternet, can be crucial to preventing network assaults [10].\
    \ Scientiﬁc research on network\ntrafﬁc categorization for IoT system security\
    \ has been extensive. It is an essential part of\nintrusion detection systems\
    \ (IDS) and aids in the identiﬁcation and detection of harmful\nnetwork activity.\n\
    This revolution in agricultural technology is built on having access to all the\
    \ data\nproduced by every sensor used on a farm, centralized via the internet,\
    \ and analyzed for the\nbest possible decision-making [11]. Any sensor employed\
    \ generates a signiﬁcant amount\nof data that can be extensively examined and\
    \ provides useful information to enhance crop\nquality or lessen environmental\
    \ impact. Cloud computing, physical hardware, and the\nIoT are the three key components\
    \ that enable the automation and data sharing needed by\nthis new smart agriculture\
    \ [12]. With the help of technical improvements (drones, sensors,\nsoftware, etc.),\
    \ we can complete agricultural jobs faster and more effectively than humans.\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 must make sure that an appropriate security mechanism is imple-\n\
    mented to avert an attack to build scalable and secure systems. The integrity\
    \ of data is\nimportant for the effective functioning of information technological\
    \ advances such as data\nanalysis and intelligent devices [13]. Because agriculture\
    \ 4.0 incorporates elements from\nconventional Internet, cellular, and wireless\
    \ technologies, which may include all of the\nsecurity risks that advancements\
    \ present situation. It also addresses current security risks\nsuch as data and\
    \ device integrity, consistency, and accessibility. Devices in agriculture 4.0\n\
    are implemented in outdoor spaces where they are subjected to external factors\
    \ such as ani-\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n3 of 27\nmals, human beings, or farming\
    \ equipment. Unknowingly, these factors remove or damage\nsensors. Since the 6th\
    \ century B.C., there has been a threat known as Agro terrorism [5].\nThis type\
    \ of terrorism could have a variety of goals, including causing ﬁnancial harm,\
    \ fear,\nand social unrest [6,7]. Terrorists could incite community disturbance\
    \ and lack of credibility\nin administration by exploiting agricultural and food\
    \ corporate crises, which can lead to\nundivided attention in the world. Cyber-agro-terrorism\
    \ in agriculture 4.0 is an electronic\nsystem in agricultural settings to harm\
    \ crops and animals while causing economic loss.\nCyber-agro-terrorists can operate\
    \ attacks on ﬁelds and through the internet, using cyber\nresources [8].\n2. Overview\

    4 of 27\nAgriculture 1.0: During the conventional agricultural age (1784–1870),\
    \ which was\ndominated by animal and human resources, the fundamental problem\
    \ with agriculture\nwas its lack of operational efﬁciency.\nAgriculture 2.0: During\
    \ the automated agricultural period of the 20th century, resource\nwaste was the\
    \ major problem.\nAgriculture 3.0: During the period of rapid advancement of automated\
    \ agriculture\n(1992–2017), the key problem was the lack of intelligence.\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0: the age of smart agriculture (which began in 2017 and is deﬁned\nby unmanned\
    \ operations) is primarily characterized by the application of contemporary\n\
    information technology to both support and intelligently improve agriculture.\n\
    The term “smart agriculture” [15] refers to a new approach to agriculture that\
    \ per-\nsonalized service through the integration of contemporary information\
    \ technologies such\nas the internet, big data, IoT, and many more [16]. In a\
    \ nutshell, the new mode is an\nintelligent agricultural solution that fuses current\
    \ information technology with agriculture.\nAlthough recent information technology\
    \ opens up new possibilities for the progress of\nagricultural output, it also\
    \ places heavy demands on security and privacy in the context of\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and poses signiﬁcant obstacles therein [17].\nMore than a movement, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 represents the next development in the sector’s\ntransition to a more intelligent,\
    \ effective, and environmentally responsible one. The supply\nchain’s daily operations\
    \ produce a tremendous amount of data [18]. Most of the time, this\ninformation\
    \ went unused, but thanks to big data and new technology, it can now be used\n\
    to boost any crop’s performance and productivity.\n2.1. Advantages of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nThe effects of smart agriculture are covered in the following sections.\n\
    Production volume: The use of smart technology in agriculture can signiﬁcantly\n\
    boost the number of products produced on the farm. This will contribute to feeding\
    \ a\ngrowing population.\nProduction quality: The wellness and nutrition of people\
    \ from all socioeconomic strata\nin the nation can be signiﬁcantly impacted by\
    \ the quality of food produced. A country’s\npopulation will live longer and in\
    \ better health with better food, which will improve its\ncitizens’ economic contribution.\n\
    Effectiveness of farming practices and resource use: The application of smart\
    \ technolo-\ngies to conventional agricultural operations can increase their effectiveness.\
    \ In turn, this\nencourages more efﬁcient use of agricultural resources.\nIdeal\
    \ cost of cultivation: It is achieved when there is a balance between quantity,\
    \ quality,\nand efﬁciency in the procedures used. This results in a higher price\
    \ for the agricultural\noutput that is produced.\nReducing wastage: The farming\
    \ industry, one of the main economic sectors, is in great\npart to blame for the\
    \ massive quantities of food and other secondary resources that are\nwasted. Smart\
    \ technology could be employed to track and cut down on this waste.\nEcologically\
    \ sustainable: The reduced agricultural waste and improved agricultural\nprocess\
    \ efﬁciency directly reduce the environmental and ecological footprint.\nEffective\
    \ use of Time: Timely delivery of the necessary insecticides, fertilizers, and\n\
    other chemicals can provide timely and high-quality agricultural output with fewer\
    \ losses\nthanks to smart agriculture.\nThe farming industry may be at threat\
    \ by the following while deploying agricultural\n4.0 technology:\n•\nTheft of\
    \ business and customer data.\n•\nTaking resources under the control of sensors\
    \ and gadgets.\n•\nDestroying the objects that devices control.\n•\nDamage to\
    \ reputation if a data breach is disclosed.\nAgriculture 4.0 may be at risk from\
    \ infrastructure damage, sensor failures may affect\npoultry and cattle breeding,\
    \ and control system hacks may affect greenhouse farming. All\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n5 of 27\nof these could cause problems or malfunction in agricultural\
    \ operations by harming the\nIoT architecture’s hardware and software. In addition,\
    \ data-collecting technologies face\nchallenges from malicious assaults, unauthorized\
    \ access, privacy breaches, and other issues.\nThe landscape has shifted, with\
    \ AI and ML research concentrating on agro-based\ncontexts, water management,\
    \ livestock, and farmlands. Monitoring, control, and decision-\nmaking alternatives\
    \ in the irrigation ﬁeld repeatedly tried to save water and enhance\nproductivity\
    \ [8–13]. Some research concentrated on plant leaf disease [14], horticulture\
    \ [15],\nvineyards [16], hydroponic [17], alert facilities [18], integration of\
    \ IoT technological innova-\ntions [19], tracking resources [20], and cloud control\
    \ [21].\n2.2. IoT in Agriculture 4.0\nTable 1 lists several well-known uses of\

    \ The ﬁnal product is greatly\ninﬂuenced by the quantity and quality of the groundwater.\
    \ As a result, this system uses\nIoT approaches to maintain appropriate groundwater\
    \ levels.\nThough there are many smart agriculture alternatives, they are still\
    \ underdeveloped\nand offer a low degree of intellect. Many initiatives are limited\
    \ in their automated systems,\nwith the internet of things sending data to the\
    \ base station [53]. There is also no implemen-\ntation with the Internet in several\
    \ cases, except that in a few cases, data is stored in the\ncloud by the local\
    \ systems.\nThe multi-layer architecture of IoT used in agriculture 4.0 consists\
    \ of four layers,\nwhich are the physical layer, network layer, edge layer, and\
    \ application layer. Table 2 below\ngives a detailed description of Resources\

    \ these devices are all implemented in\nthe physical layer, which collects data\
    \ from the farming ﬁeld and digitizes them using\nan Analog to Digital converter\
    \ (ADC). As the equipment at the physical layer does not\ncompute and store the\
    \ data, this needs to connect with the edge layer through the network\nlayer.\
    \ The edge layer includes various resources such as decision-making, gateway,\
    \ data\nﬁlters, data security, and interfaces [55].\nThe advancement of devices\
    \ and technological developments will allow for the in-\ncorporation of more computer\
    \ capabilities into systems. This type of integration aims to\nmeet the various\
    \ needs of agricultural mechanization, farming techniques, and sustainable\nagriculture\
    \ [56,57]. A further issue is data security. This is very important to focus on\n\
    data privacy, the trustworthiness of data, and the correctness of data from generation\
    \ to\ndecision-making.\n2.3. Research Motivation\nThree factors serve as inspiration\
    \ for this article:\n1.\nSmart agriculture is a new paradigm that integrates information\
    \ technology with\nconventional farming as a result of the low productivity of\
    \ traditional agriculture\nand the extensive usage of information technology.\
    \ It has the potential to become the\nnext big thing in agricultural development.\
    \ Consequently, it is crucial to outline the\ncurrent manufacturing model and\
    \ particular studies [58].\n2.\nDespite substantial research on smart agriculture,\
    \ less has been conducted in compar-\nison to industrial security solutions to\
    \ analyze security problems.\n3.\nIt is crucial to examine the features of security\
    \ concerns in relation to situations\ninvolving smart agriculture [59]. This article\
    \ attempts to give a review of the security\nchallenges raised by smart agriculture\
    \ in light of the aforementioned variables, which\ninevitably results in a signiﬁcant\
    \ number of open research questions.\n2.4. Research Contributions\nThe research\

    \ with physical equipment such as sensors and actuators.\nPhysical devices can\
    \ fail due to unintentional or intentional human behavior, viruses,\nspyware,\
    \ or cyber-attacks. Smart farming applications use a wide range of sensors and\n\
    technologies, and this diversity opens up several security risks, including the\
    \ following:\nRandom device incidents: This is the unintended alteration of physical\
    \ equipment\nthat causes it to deviate from its normal performance. The physical\
    \ equipment may be\ndamaged by farm machinery, causing short- or long-term physical\
    \ damage, as a result,\ngenerates false data and affects data accessibility.\n\
    Mobile node hijacking: It is the theft of farm equipment such as tractors, drones,\
    \ and\nsowing robots. Drones can indeed be pesticides, fertilizers sprinkling\
    \ could be performed\nby Drone, and robots could do weeding detecting disease.\
    \ The intruder may access and\nuse the farm equipment remotely without having\
    \ access permission.\nFake node: An intruder introduces imitation or harmful nodes\
    \ into the automated\nagriculture ﬁeld to disturb the smooth functioning of the\
    \ system [55]. This attack could be\ntriggered by capturing a node and making\
    \ a replica of it. This type of attack typically aims\nto either alter or modify\
    \ data-shuttered devices and applications.\nAbnormal Measurement: It senses unusual\
    \ observations due to data falsiﬁcation,\nenergy exhaustion, radio radiation,\
    \ detection of various connections, extreme storms,\nmalfunctions, or wrong inputs.\
    \ Incorrect data can jeopardize making decisions that result\nin the analysis\
    \ of data will be inaccurate, which minimizes system correctness.\nSleeplessness\
    \ attack: The sleeplessness attack sends a series of seemingly legitimate\nrequests\
    \ in order to keep the devices awake for prolonged life. As a result, the device’s\n\
    battery runs out, and the device stops working [56,57]. When the devices are turned\n\
    off, the observed information is not properly sent, jeopardizing decision-making\
    \ and\nsystem efﬁciency.\n3.2. Security Risks at Network Layer\nThe objective\
    \ of this layer is to send the generated data by the sensors from the physical\n\
    layer to the most trustable computational unit, which is the cloud. The most common\n\
    attacks, which affect the resources used in the network layer, are focused on\
    \ [58,59]. The\nsecurity risks in network layers are:\nDistributed Denial of Service\
    \ (DDoS): It attempts to affect access to service providers\nby overburdening\
    \ the communication link or manipulating protocol ﬂaws, which cause\nresources,\
    \ such as CPU and memory collapse [60].\nDue to resource exhaustion brought on\
    \ by a DDoS attack, the victim server is forced\nto block connections from new\
    \ reliable clients. The victim server’s buffer capacity or\nbandwidth may have\
    \ reached its limit of resources. The overall probability of resource\nscarcity\
    \ at the target end is provided by Equation (1) [15].\nPAttack = 1 − (1 − PBandwidth)\n\
    \01 − Pmemory\n\x01\n(1)\nwhere,\nPAttack: Probability of total attack,\nPBandwidth:\
    \ Probability of Consumption of bandwidth\nPmemory: Probability of Consumption\
    \ of memory\nAttacks on Data Transit: These types of attacks aim to retrieve information\
    \ shared\nbetween network devices in order to obtain conﬁdential information [61].\
    \ An adversary\ncould intercept trafﬁc via malicious routers or man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks [62]. Intercep-\ntion of trafﬁc reveals conﬁdential data such as private\
    \ keys, access credentials, or digital\nsignatures.\nAttacks on Routers: They\
    \ plan to change network routes in order to gain trafﬁc control.\nInimical nodes\
    \ in IoT networks might attempt to reroute communicating paths during the\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757\n10 of 27\nprocess of transmission. As a result of attacks, the\
    \ receiver might receive information lately,\npartially, or incorrectly, or not\
    \ at all [63,64].\nMalware Injection Attacks: The malware injection attack [34],\
    \ in which malware is\ninjected by an attacker into a connected computing device.\
    \ This is a very common attack\non smart farming. Malware is a very signiﬁcant\
    \ threat in distributed projects because it\nautomatically spreads through the\
    \ system, making it an appealing target for intruders.\nMalware damage comes in\
    \ multiple varieties of sizes. Malware can steal data about farm\nmaterial usage,\
    \ buying information for fruits, vegetables, and farm animals, data about\nfarm\
    \ equipment, and so on. It could hire automated devices to form a botnet that\
    \ would be\nused to commit harmful attacks under the inﬂuence of an intruder.\n\
    Botnet: At each architectural layer of the precision farming system, there are\
    \ numer-\nous IoT devices. These machines are vulnerable to attack and could be\
    \ taken over by a\ncentralized malicious system. This results in a ‘Botnet of\
    \ Things’ (BoT) [35]. A mutant farm\nworkforce IoT equipment that is already infected\
    \ [36] is easily used to infect other networks\nvia various communication links,\
    \ and thus automated farming could become an internet of\ndestructibility for\
    \ cyber illegitimates. The security features are not added in many of the\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture devices, but still, they are used frequently for establishing adequate\n\
    data security defensive system frameworks.\n3.3. Security Risks at Edge Layer\n\
    The edge contains important aspects that monitor, and control modules communicate\n\
    with all layers and access resources. The physical layer’s large volumes of data\
    \ can be\nprocessed locally rather than centralized in the cloud. The following\
    \ are major edge\nsecurity issues.\nActuator control Forge: It introduces false\
    \ measures of data into the system in order to\nmanipulate it. Typically, the\
    \ data is received by the gateway in plain text. Corrupted data\nwill lead to\
    \ poor decision-making. An opponent, for example, could inject incorrect soil\n\
    moisture measurements into a smart irrigation system to manipulate it.\nBooting\
    \ Attacks: Devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of security processes\n\
    during boot [37]. Memory cards and ﬂash drive sticks, for example, may detect\
    \ dangerous\ncodes which run at startup [38]. Suspicious booting practices could\
    \ launch numerous\nattacks on the edge with insufﬁcient protection.\nSignature\
    \ wrapping: The attacker modulates the cipher text by inserting a bogus\nelement\
    \ that allows you to perform a random Web Application requisition while identifying\n\
    as an authenticated user [39].\nMeasure infusion Forgery: It is the injection\
    \ of wrong speciﬁcations into a system in\norder to modify it. An attacker sends\
    \ known data patterns through actuators to the cloud\nstorage, which is then injected\
    \ into the system through computational units. Corrupted\ndata could lead to poor\
    \ decision-making.\nUnauthorized access: The process of validating is a critical\
    \ security component. The\nauthentication process is a technology that ensures\
    \ security and privacy, honesty, and\naccessibility [40]. Several agricultural\
    \ practices, however, use gateways with insufﬁcient or\nno access controls.\n\
    Gateway-cloud fabrication: The cloud and the gateway are linked by ISPs or wireless\n\
    connections. A network attacker could fabricate cloud requests by interrogating\
    \ a gateway.\nThe attacker could use these requests to change parameters in precision\
    \ agriculture, control\nqueries for sensitive services, or interpret system equipment.\
    \ The cloud can implement\nsecurity services as it has computational power. In\
    \ order to ensure maximum system\nreliability, these strategies must be incorporated\
    \ into the system.\n3.4. Security Risks at Application Layer\nThis layer provides\
    \ end-user assistance and data to process and make system decisions.\nThis layer’s\
    \ security concerns are application-speciﬁc, focusing on preventing data theft\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n11 of 27\nand ensuring privacy. Some of the attacks that\
    \ might affect cloud services and applications\nare listed below in terms of security.\n\
    Malicious scripts: Malicious scripts can deceive clients, infuse malicious data,\
    \ access\nconﬁdential material, and compromise security features. This type of\
    \ attack is frequently\ncarried out by cybercriminals for speciﬁc, economic, or\
    \ political reasons. They can damage\nor destabilize operational processes by\
    \ using malicious scripts, presenting unnecessary ad\ncampaigns, and stealing\
    \ money [41].\nPhishing: It is an attack that attempts to obtain highly classiﬁed\
    \ personal informa-\ntion, such as an Identity and password, fraudulently. Phishing\
    \ typically targets end-users\nthrough fraud and sites [42]. The attacker also\
    \ affects decision-making and internal opera-\ntions in many cases. The most effective\
    \ protection would be for users to remain vigilant\nwhile surﬁng the web [43].\n\
    Denial of Service (DoS): This threat disrupts service by overburdening trafﬁc\
    \ on the\nnetwork or ﬂooding the provider with repeated attempts [44]. Because\
    \ of ﬂaws in security\nsetup, an attacker can launch this attack from the Web\
    \ or a sub-system.\n4. Security Threats in Modern Agriculture\nFarmers typically\
    \ carry out the developed smart system initiatives in physical ﬁelds\nor green\
    \ ﬁelds. In Agriculture 4.0, most efforts are focused on water processes, disease\n\
    monitoring, seed production, and record keeping. It can be either automatically\
    \ con-\ntrolled or manually controlled. In both cases, the system monitors the\
    \ environment with\nsensors and changes it with actuators. Some initiatives only\
    \ digitize farms, whereas oth-\ners incorporate industry 4.0 or IoT technologies.\
    \ As an immature industry, open-ﬁeld\nagriculture is the focus of this work, with\
    \ security issues restricted to access control and\nweb-encrypted communications.\n\
    It is too difﬁcult to execute different security measures in rural areas since\
    \ there is a\nshortage of modern technical infrastructure and advanced technology.\
    \ Many difﬁculties\ncan arise if security measures are attempted in rural agriculture.\
    \ Table 3 lists a few of the\nsecurity challenges that are prevalent in rural\
    \ locations.\nTable 3. Rural-Agriculture Security Issues.\nRural-Agriculture\n\
    Security Issues for Rural\nResident\nsecurity awareness is less\nHard for Facing\

    \ less\nHard to identify base station attacks\nRecently most of the agriculture\
    \ 4.0 projects have implemented IoT, but the security\nfeatures in that have become\
    \ disabled by default. It has been introduced that a server con-\ntrols and manages\
    \ these devices remotely via a web application. Opportunistic opponents\ndid not\
    \ know details about security resources. They gain unauthorized access to the\
    \ system,\ninsert fabricated measures, fabricate actuator controls, or report\
    \ earlier attacks to divert\nthe system from its normal functioning [45–64]. The\
    \ author proposed a smart watering\nsystem that remotely controls and observes\
    \ the ﬂow of water in the farm but is not focused\non security risks to detect\
    \ malicious attacks and unallowed access that manipulate the\nmonitored data.\
    \ To monitor the growing environment, ref. [65] introduce a Hydroponic\nFarming\
    \ Ecosystem (HFE). It is automatically controlled, and the client can monitor\
    \ the\nfarming via a web interface. These automated systems require high-security\
    \ concerns to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n12 of 27\ndetect or avoid random sensor\
    \ incidents, weak sensors, wrong data injection, and other\nattacks, which could\
    \ corrupt data and affect system reliability.\nSimilarly, in [66], the author\
    \ focused on creating a system for monitoring ﬁelds based\non humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ light levels, and temperature. Irrigation can be controlled\nmanually or automatically\
    \ via web or mobile systems. An intelligent solution for detecting\ndiseases in\
    \ leaves focused in [67]. By using sensor data and camera images, the system\n\
    identiﬁes leaf diseases. A mobile or web application is used by the end-user to\
    \ interact\nwith the system. This paper does not go into detail about the implementation\
    \ of security.\nSimilarly, ref. [68] proposed an intelligent agricultural system\
    \ for information inter-\nchange among farm equipment. The article discusses the\
    \ system’s construction but makes\nno mention of manual intervention or remote\
    \ control, nor does it concern any security\nchallenges. As this is a data exchange\
    \ system, the DoS attack can affect the network layer.\nRef. [69] provides NETPIE,\
    \ a solution that gives agricultural product information. The\ngrowing environment\
    \ can be controlled and monitored with a set of physical devices. The\ngenerated\
    \ data is analyzed saved in a QR code, and which is then available to the customer.\n\
    NETPIE does not discuss security resources. Ref. [51] Introduced monitoring of\
    \ crop ﬁelds\nand watering using IoT, which measures data and controls data to\
    \ avoid unauthorized\naccess to these data but could not protect the other devices,\
    \ which leads to weak security,\nwhich might result in a major loss. Ref. [52]\
    \ Proposed a system known as SEnviro, which\nobserves the crop ﬁeld and detects\
    \ diseases remotely. This system does not focus on the\nprediction of disease,\
    \ but unauthorized access is controlled here.\nAccording to the relevant literature,\
    \ from a security standpoint, farming equipment\nis used without security features.\
    \ Furthermore, the gateway contains no security infor-\nmation. Transmission privacy\
    \ or device authentication is not presented in any of the\nabove-discussed systems.\
    \ Access control and management and encryption of data need\nto add security technologies\
    \ to Information dissemination. Smart agriculture is currently\na convenient target\
    \ for cyber criminals’ agents. Attacks can be motivated by a variety of\nfactors,\
    \ including an advertisement, intellectual, or even terrorist reasons. Terrorist\
    \ groups,\nfor example, can cause ecological loss to a country, economic chancers\
    \ may take part in\nmarket manipulation, and workers can attack a range of factors\
    \ [53].\n4.1. Data and Device Security Issues and Threats in Agriculture 4.0\n\
    As was previously mentioned, harsh environmental factors that can seriously harm\n\
    electromechanical equipment, such as extreme heat, moisture, moisture, shocks,\
    \ and other\nanomalies, have a direct impact on the agricultural sector [70].\
    \ The majority of these\nsensors are prone to failure, making it feasible for\
    \ them to produce inaccurate data and\ninstructions that could cause a manufacturing\
    \ disaster [71]. Additionally, sensors and\nnetwork equipment are predominance\
    \ reachable. This poses a serious risk to farmlands\nsince anybody with bad intentions\
    \ can access them and corrupt or harm them to cause\nthem to malfunction [72].\n\
    Another potential security concern is the online transfer of the information gathered\n\
    by IoT sensors and other agricultural machines. Major security concern in the\
    \ agriculture\nindustry is security, privacy, and control [73], as farmers may\
    \ incur a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial\nand personal loss in the event of a data breach.\
    \ Ref. [74] Divides the threats to conﬁdentiality\ninto four distinct categories:\n\
    •\nIntentional data theft through smart platforms and applications that do not\
    \ adhere to\nsecurity and privacy standards;\n•\nInternal information thefts from\
    \ a stakeholder in the supply chain intended to harm\nan agri-business or a farmer;\n\

    \ and\nother threats.\n•\nUnsupervised foreign access to private and sensitive\
    \ information using drones, sensors,\nand cameras with the intention of utilizing\
    \ them to harm farmers or jeopardize public\nsafety [64,75].\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n13 of 27\nEvery application of modern technology, IoT in agriculture,\
    \ carries the aforementioned\ndangers, weaknesses, and threats. A more thorough\
    \ and complex explanation of the risks\nand their sources in aspects of cyberattacks\
    \ in the agro sector is provided in the following\nparagraph, which is primarily\
    \ focused on illegal behavior and exploited vulnerabilities in\nICT systems.\n\
    4.2. Cybercrime and Cybersecurity in Agriculture\nA cyber-attack on an agribusiness\
    \ or food industry is increasingly likely today thanks\nto automation and the\
    \ widespread use of internet-connected equipment, which give poten-\ntial (cyber)\
    \ criminals greater chances in ﬁelds that were previously too remote or difﬁcult\n\
    to physically access [61]. Consequently, a potential cyber-attack or security\
    \ problem in\nan agricultural organization could have serious human or ﬁnancial\
    \ repercussions. This\nimplies that pertinent security concerns brought about\
    \ by the widespread and ongoing\nusage of IoT, as well as the emergence of agro-terrorism,\
    \ require adequate attention, better\nequipment, and solutions [62].\nThe bulk\
    \ of system operations in the agriculture sector are network-based, and fre-\n\
    quently these systems are not protected from cyber threats, which can have substantial\n\
    ﬁnancial and security ramiﬁcations [76–86]. Five important elements, as identiﬁed\
    \ in [87],\nstrengthen these risks in the agricultural sector:\n•\nIncreasing\
    \ the farm consolidation highly depends on technology;\n•\nThe joint ventures\
    \ of the food supply chains, allow manufacturers to conduct processes\nand trade\
    \ products directly;\n•\nFood-related technologies in intelligent markets depend\
    \ on more components, which\nincreases their vulnerability to errors and malfunctions.\n\
    •\nEffective monitoring of food-related systems, social networks, and industries\
    \ in a safe,\ndynamic, and almost real-time manner is lacking, making it difﬁcult\
    \ to identify serious\ndigital and security vulnerabilities that could be the\
    \ root of signiﬁcant data breaches\nand system defects.\nDue to the heightened\
    \ risk of cybercrime, the agriculture sector may be impacted by\nsuch threats\
    \ in a number of ways. Categorize these methods as in [84]. Threats of tampering\n\
    include delivery disruption, conﬁdential information interception, formula modiﬁcation,\n\
    and delivery disruption. These risks are undoubtedly closely related to the adoption\
    \ and\napplication of technological advancements in the agriculture and food sectors.\n\
    Cooper et al. and Bogaardt et al. identify the following as the primary technical\n\
    advancement areas that are commonly used in the agri-sector and contain vulnerable\n\
    places for harmful cyber-attacks [86–88]:\n•\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID);\
    \ wireless communications (such as Wi-Fi);\n•\nSensors for the infrastructure,\
    \ soil, and crops;\n•\nDrones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);\n•\n\
    PA-speciﬁc automation solutions (such Real Time Kinematic Technology);\n•\nPortable\
    \ electronics (such as laptops, smartphones, and GPS trackers);\n•\nSmart agriculture\
    \ and vertical agriculture;\n•\nThe use of AI in conjunction with biotech and\
    \ nanotech (AI).\nTable 4 provides a summary of the study performed on different\

    [62,79,92,97,98]\n4.3. IoT Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Threats in Agriculture\n\
    IoT is made up of four main systems that make it possible to communicate between\n\
    nodes. Sensing technology, IoT gateways, cloud servers, data storage, and mobile\
    \ appli-\ncations for remote control make up an IoT system. The architectures\
    \ of IoT systems in\nagriculture come with current and new threats and vulnerabilities.\
    \ These ﬂaws can be\nlinked to IoT device hardware and software problems, communication\
    \ protocols, and also\ndata processing and storage solutions (found, for example,\
    \ in cloud infrastructures, data\ncenters, and smartphones) [2,11].\nAccording\
    \ to [99–101], the following is a concise but accurate classiﬁcation of the\n\
    primary causes of low security in the IoT:\n•\nFirmware that is not patched and/or\
    \ default passwords that have been used for a long\ntime allow for device compromise\
    \ in an IoT network.\n•\nBecause of the limited computing power of smart devices\
    \ and vendors’ efforts to\nkeep their prices low in a cutthroat market, it is\
    \ difﬁcult to incorporate complicated\ncryptographic algorithms.\n•\nFlaws in\
    \ the routing protocols used by smart devices (such as Bluetooth and ZigBee);\n\
    •\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol’s outdated, low-security version,\
    \ which is\nfrequently still in use;\n•\nConducting passive vulnerability detection\
    \ using search engines;\n•\nThe risk of assembling millions of smart devices into\
    \ a potent botnet (such as Mirai),\ngiven how simple it is to ﬁnd vulnerabilities\
    \ via internet scanning;\n•\nA general disregard for the security of smart gadgets\n\
    Finally, a variety of criteria can be used to categorize IoT vulnerabilities,\
    \ hazards, and\nthreats. These risks apply to all IoT applications, including\
    \ those in the agricultural sector.\nFirst, internal vs. external risks and passive\
    \ vs. active risks are the two basic classiﬁcation\ngroups of security concerns\
    \ in IoT systems in the agriculture sector [79].\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n15\
    \ of 27\nIoT hazards are categorized in another intriguing way using a layer-based\
    \ system.\nAccording to [22], each of the levels below integrates many technologies\
    \ that could lead\nto a variety of security threats, vulnerabilities, and/or breaches.\
    \ The application layer,\nmiddleware layer, internet layer, access gateway layer,\
    \ and edge technology layer are the\nﬁve main layers that make up the IoT architecture.\n\
    5. Existing Research on Security in Agriculture 4.0\nIn [54], the author states\
    \ that The United States Department of Homeland Security\nissued a report emphasizing\
    \ the signiﬁcance of agriculture 4.0 and the associated internet\nsecurity threat\
    \ and possible attacks.\nThe report emphasizes the information security model\
    \ of conﬁdential information,\ncredibility, and accessibility in farming. The\
    \ researchers of [55] suggested a new access\ncontrol solution that combines session\
    \ keys and public keys to speed up the encrypted\ncommunications tasks. It yields\
    \ quick and lightweight appropriate control measures\nthat are ideal for precision\
    \ agriculture communication. Ref. [56] Proposed a framework\nfor understanding\
    \ vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and their application in an\nintelligent\
    \ farming environment. The goal of the approach is to determine the level to\n\
    which intelligent farming emerging innovations are prone to cyber. It assesses\
    \ the threat\nprediction model using the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).\n\
    Nowadays, The Blockchain is not only used in cryptocurrency but also utilized\
    \ in\nother ﬁelds and different applications such as in the medical sector, agriculture\
    \ sector,\netc. [57–59]. This article concentrated on the application of blockchain\
    \ technology to food\nsafety. For tracking and monitoring the food items and stages\
    \ of production, such as\ncultivation/breeding, raw resources, processing, transporting,\
    \ warehousing, and selling,\nthe author developed a system [60]. In addition,\
    \ the system employs a variety of sensor-\nbased equipment to adopt sustainable\
    \ recording and conﬁrmation with sensor-based\nveriﬁcation. Ref. [61] Proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based easy and simple security framework for\nsmart Greenﬁeld farming.\
    \ Each IoT node can nominate the cluster member’s leader, which\nhelps to avoid\
    \ a hot spot problem if an intruder focuses on the leader node. Furthermore,\n\
    the authors discussed the security risks of their suggested scheme, which adhered\
    \ to the\ntraditional conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability principles.\
    \ Ref. [62] proposed a cost-\neffective IoT-based security monitoring system.\
    \ The physical layer is the primary concern\nof this system of precision agriculture,\
    \ where data are collected from sensors. These data\nare sent to a controller,\
    \ which analyses it to take action, such as activating the actuators for\nwater\
    \ sprinklers on farms. Table 5 describes some of the recent research which has\
    \ already\nbeen performed on security issues related to smart farming.\nGupta,\
    \ M et al. explained [102] the necessity of clouds applied in vehicles in this\
    \ time-\nand location-sensitive context and present an extended access control\
    \ oriented (E-ACO)\narchitecture that is pertinent to IoV. Here, they describe\
    \ using scenarios to highlight access\ncontrol needs in our vision of cloud-assisted\
    \ connected automobiles and vehicular IoT, as\nwell as approaches to various access\
    \ control models that may be applied at different tiers\nof the E-ACO architecture\
    \ and in the authorization framework.\nGupta, M et al. [103], in their work, describe\
    \ an edge infrastructure-based solution to\nV2V and V2I communication that is\
    \ safe and trustworthy in place of direct peer-to-peer\nconnection. To approve,\
    \ check, and verify the authenticity, integrity, and anonymity of\ncommunications\
    \ sent in the system, they add trusted cloudlets in this section. Along with\n\
    a proof of concept implementation of the suggested approach on the AWS IoT platform,\n\
    they also describe a formal attribute-based model for V2V and V2I communication,\
    \ known\nas AB-ITS. This cloudlet-supported architecture supports crucial use\
    \ cases such as an\naccident or ice-threat warning and other safety applications.\
    \ It supplements direct V2V or\nV2I communication.\nSontowski, S. et al. [104]\
    \ presented a DoS attack that can impair a smart farm’s\noperation by interfering\
    \ with the functioning of installed on-ﬁeld sensors. They speciﬁcally\ncovered\
    \ a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack that makes use of ﬂaws in IEEE 802.11, where\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n16 of 27\nthe management packets are not encrypted. A\
    \ development board for the ESP8266 maker\nfocus When a Raspberry Pi is attached,\
    \ WiFi Deauther Monster is used to disconnect it\nfrom the network and stop sensor\
    \ data from being transferred to a distant cloud.\nThe notion of Activity-Centric\
    \ Access Control (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosys-\ntems was ﬁrst proposed\
    \ by Gupta, M. et al. in [105] and discussed in this article as a ﬁrst\nstep.\
    \ Here, they examined the idea of activity with regard to cooperative and dispersed\n\
    yet interconnected systems, identifying the many parties involved as well as the\
    \ crucial\nelements to consider when making an activity control choice. They provide\
    \ an initial\nframework for developing activity control expressions that may be\
    \ used by various smart\nobjects in the system.\nThe biggest obstacle to the growth\
    \ of cloud computing is security worries. Information\nsecurity continues to have\
    \ an impact on the market even though it raises inconveniences\nrelated to information\
    \ security. The threat of security breaches in the cloud infrastructure\nmust\
    \ be understood by clients. Cloud-computing capacity, networking, and computing\n\
    powers are brought to the edge by fog computing. One of the most critical challenges\
    \ with\nfog computing platforms is safety and security. Lightweight devices have\
    \ beneﬁted greatly\nfrom edge computing’s ability to complete difﬁcult tasks quickly,\
    \ but the technology’s hasty\ndevelopment has led to a general disregard for safety\
    \ risks in edge computing stages and\nthe applications they allow.\nIn our proposed\
    \ framework we have focused on the threats in fog computing-based\nIoT environment\
    \ via blockchain for the application in agriculture 4.0.\nTable 5. Related Research\

    \ is to acquire meaningful information from the external\nenvironment via sensors\
    \ to take required action against it. This sensor layer has a variety\nof Sensor\
    \ nodes of various forms and sizes. As a result, they all use the same basic compo-\n\
    nents, such as input and output components, information handling units, communication\n\
    segments, and many more units for the management of power sections. To analyze\
    \ and\nstore all detected data, it is sent to the relevant fog nodes. Furthermore,\
    \ Sensor nodes\nreceive instructions to undertake agricultural operations.\n6.2.\
    \ Fog Computing Layer\nThis layer is made up of multiple fog nodes, which are\
    \ insubstantial equipment that\ncarry out processing, communication, and storing\
    \ tools to do operations that an end device\ncannot perform. Not every piece of\
    \ data that is gathered becomes processed on the cloud.\nRather, this layer hosts\
    \ all authentic analysis and latency-sensitive applications.\nVirtualization:\
    \ Recognizing that conﬁguring several devices, in the same manner,\nmight be time-consuming,\
    \ the nodes can be contained inside a Virtualized environment for\na more pleasant\
    \ setup for all subsequent fog nodes.\nAgricultural Sensor data monitoring: This\
    \ node is going to collect real-time sensing\ndata, analyze it, visualize it,\
    \ manage devices, and store some of it locally. The user can\nobtain information\
    \ from the fog layer while smoothly synchronizing cloud-directed data.\nBlock-chain\
    \ Client software: This consists of a piece of programs that is installed on\n\
    the fog node. Its primary goal is to sync authentic sensitive Sensor data to the\
    \ Blockchain.\nIt is in charge of producing transactions, batching them, and sending\
    \ them to the validator\nso that they can be aggregated into blocks and recorded\
    \ to the Blockchain.\nSimulated Switch: Additionally, this node is used as a transmitting\
    \ device with the\nsupport of virtual switch software, which provides NFV and\
    \ SDN technologies to enhance\nnetwork services by establishing the routing features\
    \ for computational extension and\ncontrol. Some network virtual functions include\
    \ security, quality of service (QoS), and\nautomated control. The main objective\
    \ is to create switching layers for virtual machine\nenvironments while continuing\
    \ to support the OpenFlow protocol [107], which allows this\nnode to interact\
    \ directly with the SDN Controller; an outstanding demonstration of such\nimplementation\
    \ is Open vSwitch, an interactive multilayered software switch.\n6.3. Distributed\
    \ Network Using SDN\nThis network is made up of numerous geologically dispersed\
    \ and SDN controllers\nlinked to it that operates as a common Networking Operating\
    \ System (NOS), combining\nnominally autonomous operations with centralized control\
    \ [108]. The main component of\nan SDN network is the SDN controller. This can\
    \ help with network monitoring by managing\nall transactions among network and\
    \ application devices, allowing it to manage and adjust\nnetwork ﬂows more efﬁciently\
    \ in response to new requirements [109]. It maintains a\nconsistent glimpse of\
    \ the network from afar, delivering data to fog nodes via one APIs and\napplication\
    \ via other APIs (MQTT, CoAP...) [109]. In addition, the SDN controller employs\n\
    a Block-chain contractor to properly secure ﬂow tables of SDN in the Block-chain,\
    \ hence\navoiding rule counterfeit.\n6.4. Block-Chain Based Network\nTo keep all\
    \ the nodes up to date, all Blockchain modules are interconnected and con-\nstantly\
    \ exchange the most updated information in the Blockchain among themselves. Smart\n\
    contracts will trigger and enforce relevant actions based on the data provided,\
    \ allowing\nfor veriﬁable transactions in the Blockchain when such circumstances\
    \ are met without the\nrequirement for third-party involvement [110,111]. The\
    \ Ethereum Blockchain platform\nserves as the foundation for the blockchain network\
    \ architecture because it provides a\nhighly ﬂexible and modular design that separates\
    \ the runtime environment as per the\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n19 of 27\napplication\
    \ domain, permitting agreements to deﬁne the business rules for the application\n\
    that are not necessary for the core system’s fundamental design.\nThe Blockchain\
    \ complete node is made up of the following components:\n1.\nNode for Validation:\
    \ This is a key component that veriﬁes batches of transactions\nbefore combining\
    \ them into blocks. It also ensures that candidate blocks are added to\nthe Blockchain\
    \ version for each node.\n2.\nBlockchain Software: it determines which transactions\
    \ or operations are permitted on\nthe block-chain and contains the following:\n\
    •\nDatabase model: it deﬁnes relevant operations and the description of the transac-\n\
    tion’s payload.\n•\nTransaction Processor: deﬁnes the business logic for different\
    \ applications, vali-\ndates batches of transactions, and modiﬁes the blockchain\
    \ system based on the\napplication’s rules.\n•\nClient: it speciﬁes the service\
    \ client functionality, which the client develops and\ndelivers to the validator.\
    \ The client also shows blockchain information.\n•\nREST API: This protocol is\
    \ used to communicate within the clients and the\ntransactions processing system.\n\
    3.\nDigital Signature: To ensure transaction integrity, the data used in the transactions\
    \ is\nhashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the sender’s secret key to\
    \ produce a\nsignature. The processor then validates the transaction by verifying\
    \ this signature.\n7. Case Studies and Experimental Results\nTo test the security\
    \ framework, we allowed DDoS attacks against the Blockchain\nNetwork. A distributed\
    \ denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targets websites and servers by\ndisrupting\
    \ network services. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application’s resources.\n\

    Figure 6. Experimental Setup Architecture. \nTo put our framework architecture\
    \ to the test, we conducted three case studies. \nCase 1: We examined the platform’s\
    \ usual workflow, which means we did not \nduct any attacks on the Ethereum blockchain.\
    \ \nCase 2: Using the Hping programme on the host PC, we launched a DDoS assaul\n\
    the Blockchain network. We implemented a DDoS mitigation programme on the S\n\
    controller. \nCase 3: We launched a DDoS attack against the Blockchain network,\
    \ by turning\nthe DDoS mitigation programme in the SDN controller. \nDuring the\
    \ simulation, we noticed two crucial metrics in each case: \n• \nThe number of\
    \ network packets received by the Blockchain per minute. \n• \nThe number of transactions\
    \ published in the Blockchain network. \nThe results are shown in Figures 7 and\
    \ 8, respectively. Taking the case 1 finding\nideal, with 120 published transactions\

    \ than 60% compared to the 1st case, and an unreliable Blockch\nnetwork. To understand\
    \ the outcomes of the second scenario, we must first recog\nwhat took place in\
    \ the network during the test. The Open vSwitch sends all network tr\ndata to\

    \ the Ethereum Blockchain network and its\nSupply Chain AssetTrack application\
    \ in the Virtual Machine. To keep records of their\nupdated information, we formed\
    \ a user for the host system (fog node) and various assets.\nEvery reported value\
    \ will be used by the blockchain client to update the speciﬁed asset in\nthe Ethereum\
    \ blockchain.\nTo put our framework architecture to the test, we conducted three\
    \ case studies.\nCase 1: We examined the platform’s usual workﬂow, which means\
    \ we did not conduct\nany attacks on the Ethereum blockchain.\nCase 2: Using the\
    \ Hping programme on the host PC, we launched a DDoS assault\non the Blockchain\
    \ network. We implemented a DDoS mitigation programme on the\nSDN controller.\n\
    Case 3: We launched a DDoS attack against the Blockchain network, by turning off\
    \ the\nDDoS mitigation programme in the SDN controller.\nDuring the simulation,\
    \ we noticed two crucial metrics in each case:\n•\nThe number of network packets\
    \ received by the Blockchain per minute.\n•\nThe number of transactions published\
    \ in the Blockchain network.\nThe results are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.\
    \ Taking the case 1 ﬁndings as\nideal, with 120 published transactions in 10 min\
    \ at an average of 100 Kbps; the third scenario\nrevealed a really dismal performance\
    \ with about 45 published transactions, representing a\nloss of more than 60%\
    \ compared to the 1st case, and an unreliable Blockchain network. To\nunderstand\
    \ the outcomes of the second scenario, we must ﬁrst recognize what took place\
    \ in\nthe network during the test. The Open vSwitch sends all network trafﬁc data\
    \ to the sFlow\nforecast system, a real-time reporting system that gives real-time\
    \ notice of network assaults,\ninvolving attackers and target information, to\
    \ the SDN controller security framework via\ncommands. The SDN controller interacts\
    \ with the switch to discard DDoS trafﬁc while\nallowing valid trafﬁc to continue\
    \ through. The attack is stopped fast enough to prevent it\nfrom rapidly growing\
    \ and resulting in 95 blocks published, which is approximately 40%\nmore than\
    \ the 3rd case.\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n21 of 27\nProcesses 2023, 11, x FOR\

    Modernization of agricultural methods is required to increase productivity levels\n\
    while conserving nature. Precision agriculture could improve farming works by\
    \ controlling\nactuators more efﬁciently, enhancing the use of resources, increasing\
    \ revenues, and mini-\nmizing expenses. In order to accomplish this objective,\
    \ IoT technologies have to incorporate\nmore computing performance, such as edge\
    \ computing, big data handling, automated\nresources, and safety features. As\
    \ limited devices sense a huge amount of data and forward\nit to the gateway or\
    \ the cloud, security requires special attention. The data must be secured\nthroughout\
    \ the agricultural system, from diagnosis to risks and inventory.\nEven though\
    \ numerous security issues may affect farming production, they still\ninclude\
    \ a few security measures. This could be because these technologies were in their\n\
    initial phases of development. For most of the points, only computing resources\
    \ are\nincorporated, and that has limited computation power. As a result, security\
    \ mechanisms\nare very rare in the current list of requirement speciﬁcations.\
    \ Reaching a higher level\nof agricultural development, on the other hand, necessitates\
    \ technologies with security\nfeatures that provide enough quality and validity\
    \ to incorporate these technologies on a\nhigh level. As precision agriculture\
    \ introduces new complexities, it also opens up new\nfuture directions in security\
    \ and other areas.\nIn this study, we suggested a security framework for the agricultural\
    \ internet of things\nthat integrates blockchain technology, fog computing, and\
    \ software-deﬁned networking.\nThe suggested architecture avoids the requirement\
    \ for simulation-based work with both\nprivate and public blockchain for communication\
    \ between SDN controllers and IoT devices.\nHere, for IoT connectivity, each SDN\
    \ controller is linked to a blockchain. SDN controllers\nare interconnected by\
    \ a network’s topology. One of the key objectives of the proposed\narchitecture\
    \ is to enhance communication security for IoT devices. For IoT devices with\n\
    limited resources, distributed trust-based veriﬁcation makes blockchain even more\
    \ use-\nful. With a focus on ﬁxing security and data reliability issues in a distributed\
    \ controller\ncontext. Additionally, we want to increase the accuracy of our system\
    \ using machine\nlearning methods.\nIt might be signiﬁcant to add an intrusion\
    \ detection system utilizing various deep\nlearning algorithms in future work\
    \ to prevent the insertion of fake Sensor data in the\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P., S.D. and S.R.; methodology,\

    \ in the 21st century depends on the compatibility of artificial and natural \n\
    complex systems such as the hydrological cycle and urban water systems (Beck et\
    \ al., 2010), \nnatural energy sources and renewable energy systems, climate extremes\
    \ and disaster mitigation \n(Ewing and Demir, 2021), and the agricultural supply\
    \ chain and resilient infrastructures (Alabbad \net al., 2021). More compatible\
    \ natural and artificial system integration is possible by making more \nmeasurements\
    \ about natural systems, obtaining more data (Muste et al., 2017), and using these\
    \ \ndata for the development of artificial systems (Omatu et al., 2015) and digital\
    \ twin environments \n(Sermet and Demir, 2020). This need has increased the importance\
    \ of reliable data and accelerated \ndata processing technology (Hu and Demir,\
    \ 2021). As a result of the rapidly developing \ninformation and communication\
    \ technology approaches in the last two decades, digital \ntransformation has\
    \ accelerated in nearly all sectors (Knell, 2021). Societies' perspectives on\
    \ issues \nsuch as planning, production, and implementation have evolved in parallel\
    \ (Savic, 2021). \nHydrology and water resources domain followed the same trend\
    \ with developments in \nhydroinformatics (Demir et al., 2022). The most notable\
    \ developments can be listed as novel \napplications of deep learning in image\
    \ synthesis and communication (Gautam et al., 2022; Sermet \nand Demir, 2021),\
    \ large scale modeling and analysis on client-side systems (Ewing et al., 2022;\
    \ \nLi et al., 2022), virtual and augmented reality for hydrological education\
    \ and modeling purposes \n(Sermet and Demir, 2022), and novel programming libraries\
    \ and data standards (Ramirez et al., \n2022; Xiang and Demir, 2022). As a natural\
    \ outcome of this rapid digital transformation, the water \nsector has started\
    \ to generate, process, and store more data (Haltas et al., 2021). However, this\
    \ \nprocess has necessitated the reliability, security, and standardization of\
    \ hydrological data because \nreliable data is essential for more accurate hydrological\
    \ forecasts. Similarly, data standardization \nand security are crucial for water\
    \ systems stakeholder engagement in a secure and trustworthy way \n(Voogd et al.,\
    \ 2022). Addressing trust-related concerns has accelerated with the realization\
    \ of the \npotential of blockchain technology. \nBlockchain technology is an advanced\
    \ database mechanism that allows transparent \ninformation sharing within a network\
    \ (Nakamoto, 2008). A blockchain database stores data in \nblocks linked together\
    \ on a chain. The data is chronologically consistent, as it cannot be deleted\
    \ or \nchanged in the chain without consensus on the network. As a result, blockchain\
    \ technology can be \nused to create an immutable ledger to track orders, payments,\
    \ accounts, and other transactions. \nThere are built-in mechanisms in the system\
    \ that prevent unauthorized transaction entries and \ncreate consistency in the\
    \ common viewing of these transactions.  \nBlockchain is a newly emerging technology\
    \ that has been adopted by various sectors in \ninnovative ways and is the subject\
    \ of research and development activities for the last decade. \nBlockchain-based\
    \ energy companies can create a trading platform for the sale of electricity \n\
    between individuals, or homeowners with solar panels can use a similar platform\
    \ to sell excess \nsolar electricity to their neighbors. This process is largely\
    \ automated as smart meters generate \ntransactions, the blockchain records them.\
    \ Likewise, traditional financial systems such as banks \nand stock exchanges\
    \ can use blockchain services to manage online payments, accounts, and stock \n\
    market trading. Also, companies in the media and entertainment industries can\
    \ use blockchain \ntechnology to manage copyrighted data. Similarly, retail companies\
    \ can use the blockchain to track \nmovements of good between suppliers and buyers\
    \ (Akinbi et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Jing et al., \n2021; Li et al., 2022a).\
    \ Blockchain technology has the potential to expand a long-term vision in \nwater\
    \ resource management and has the undeniable promise of decentralized water systems\
    \ as \nwater becomes a sensitive issue around the world. \nAlthough there are\
    \ systematic reviews about the applications of blockchain technology in \nenergy\
    \ markets (Gad et al., 2022), food supply chain (Castellini et al., 2022), the\
    \ health sector \n(Merlo et al., 2023), and the effects of blockchain on business\
    \ in general, there is no comprehensive \nliterature review study on applications\
    \ of the blockchain technology in water resources and \nhydrology. \nThis paper\
    \ presents a systematic review and analysis of hydrological applications within\
    \ the \nscope of blockchain-based technologies. The literature review, which includes\
    \ journal papers, \nconference papers, technical websites, technical project documents,\
    \ and hackathon projects, was \nconducted in detail. Each study is classified\
    \ and evaluated according to the area of hydrology it \nfocuses on, its purpose,\
    \ the level of development of the blockchain application, and the technical \n\
    details it uses when applying blockchain technology. The study aims to explore\
    \ real-time and \npotential application areas of blockchain technology in hydrology\
    \ and water resources \nmanagement. At the same time, it aims to create technical\
    \ guidance on blockchain for all water \nsector stakeholders, examine how blockchain\
    \ technology will provide efficiency and benefits for \nwater resources management,\
    \ and draw the attention of hydroinformatics professionals to new \ngeneration\
    \ data storage and processing algorithms. \n \n1.1. Background on Blockchain Technology\
    \ \nStoring data in distributed ledgers, deciding which data to store with a consensus\
    \ algorithm, \ndefining preconditions with a smart contract, and being able to\
    \ track the recorded data \ntransparently, have been discussed theoretically in\
    \ financial applications since the 1990s, due to \nthe disadvantages of traditional\
    \ data storage systems and the need for reliable third parties in \nfinancial\
    \ transactions (Szabo, 1998). As mentioned before, Bitcoin was the first real-time\
    \ \napplication to record financial transaction data. Although the words \"block\"\
    \ and \"chain\" are always \nmentioned as separate terms in the original bitcoin\
    \ whitepaper, the name of the technology was \nshaped to \"blockchain\" after\
    \ a while (Nakamoto, 2008). The second milestone of blockchain \ntechnology and\
    \ first example of the application of recording transaction data to a database\
    \ only if \nboth parties meet a certain prerequisite, was announced with the Ethereum\
    \ whitepaper (Buterin, \n2014) where the predetermined conditions are called smart\
    \ contracts or chain code.  \nThere are four main types of decentralized or distributed\
    \ networks in the blockchain. Public \nblockchain networks are permissionless\
    \ networks that allow anyone to join. All members of the \nblockchain have equal\
    \ rights to read, edit, and verify the blockchain. Public blockchain networks\
    \ \nare mainly used for trading and mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum,\
    \ and Litecoin \n(Wang et al., 2022). Private blockchains are controlled by a\
    \ single entity. This authority decides \nwho can become a member and what rights\
    \ the members have in the network. Private blockchains \nare only partially decentralized\
    \ because they contain access restrictions. Hybrid blockchains \ncombine some\
    \ features of both private and public networks. Companies can set up private,\
    \ \npermission-based systems as well as a common system. Thus, they control access\
    \ to certain data \nstored on the blockchain while keeping the rest of the data\
    \ public. They use smart contracts to \nallow members of the partner system to\
    \ check whether private transactions have been completed. \nFor example, hybrid\
    \ blockchains can allow shared access to digital currency, while keeping bank-\n\
    owned currency private. Consortium blockchain networks are managed by a group\
    \ of \norganizations. Pre-selected organizations share responsibility for maintaining\
    \ the continuity of the \nblockchain and determining data access rights. Consortium\
    \ blockchain networks are generally \npreferred in sectors where many organizations\
    \ have a common goal and can benefit from \nresponsibility sharing (Arooj et al.,\
    \ 2022).  \nThe blockchain protocol refers to different types of blockchain platforms\
    \ that can be used for \napplication development purposes. Each blockchain protocol\
    \ adapts fundamental blockchain \nprinciples to suit specific industries or applications.\
    \ The most famous blockchain protocols are \nHyperledger, Ethereum, Corda, and\
    \ Quorum. Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source project with a \nset of tools and\
    \ libraries. In that way, it is possible to customize blockchain applications.\
    \ \nHyperledger Fabric is a modular, general-purpose framework that offers unique\
    \ identity \nmanagement and access control features. Due to these features, it\
    \ is suitable for various usage areas \nsuch as tracking and monitoring of supply\
    \ chains, trade finance, loyalty and reward programs, and \nreconciliation of\
    \ financial assets (Hang and Kim, 2021). Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain\
    \ \nplatform that is useful to build public blockchain applications (Estevam et\
    \ al., 2021). Corda is an \nopen-source blockchain project designed for business.\
    \ Quorum is an open-source blockchain \nprotocol derived from Ethereum. It was\
    \ specifically designed for use in a private blockchain \nnetwork where all nodes\
    \ are owned by only one member or in a consortium blockchain network \nwhere multiple\
    \ members each own a portion of the network (Singh et al., 2022). \nIn summary,\
    \ the main features of blockchain technology that make a difference are described\
    \ \nas follows: Decentralization in blockchain involves the transfer of control\
    \ and decision-making \npowers from a central legal entity (i.e., an individual,\
    \ organization, or group) to a distributed \nnetwork. Decentralized blockchain\
    \ networks use the principle of transparency to reduce the need \nfor trust between\
    \ participants. These networks discourage participants from exercising authority\
    \ \nor control over one another, which reduces the functionality of the network.\
    \ Another main feature \nis immutability, which means that data cannot be changed\
    \ or tampered with once it is stored in the \nblockchain. If a log contains an\
    \ error, you need to add a new transaction to reverse the error, and \nboth transactions\
    \ will be visible on the network. Finally, the consensus mechanism is prominent\
    \ \naspect of a blockchain system, which sets the rules for the consent of the\
    \ participants regarding \nthe recording of transactions. New transactions may\
    \ be recorded only after the majority of the \nparticipants in the network have\
    \ approved them.  \nThe blockchain architecture, on the other hand, includes several\
    \ technical components, which \nare listed as follows: (a) the distributed ledger\
    \ is the shared database used to record transactions in \nthe blockchain network;\
    \ (b) smart contracts are programs that are automatically executed and \nstored\
    \ in the blockchain system when predetermined conditions are met. They run \"\
    if-then\" checks \nso that transactions can be completed safely; and (c) public\
    \ key encryption is a security feature \nthat uniquely identifies participants\
    \ in the blockchain network. This mechanism generates two sets \nof keys for network\
    \ members. One of the keys is a public key that everyone on the network uses \n\
    together. The other key is a private key that is unique to each member. Private\
    \ and public keys \nwork together to unlock the data in the ledger (Figure 1).\
    \ The first generation of blockchain is \nbitcoin and cryptocurrencies; the second\
    \ generation blockchain is smart contracts or chain code; \nand the third generation,\
    \ or future, of blockchain will continue to evolve and grow as companies \ndiscover\
    \ and implement new application areas. The ongoing blockchain revolution continues\
    \ to \noffer limitless potential. \nLike many other industries, the initial ideas\
    \ for the implementation of blockchain in hydrology \nand water resources management\
    \ are mainly focused on the advantages of storing data most \nreliably. Water-related\
    \ data reliability has a key role in water management in all dimensions. Since\
    \ \nwater is a multidimensional natural resource, water resources can be managed\
    \ most effectively by \noptimizing the interests of stakeholders with many different\
    \ priorities. In addition to having \ndifferent priorities regarding the quantity\
    \ and quality of water, there is a social dimension for the \nwater as well. Reliable\
    \ data about shared water resources is essential for the establishment of trust.\
    \ \n(Pahl-Wostl, 2015; Stern and Coleman, 2015). The straightforward guarantee\
    \ of socio-\nhydrological trust and data reliability is made possible by a simply\
    \ distributed digital architecture \nbuilt on blockchain and smart contracts.\
    \  \n \n \nFigure 1. Illustration of basic blockchain architecture \n \nUncertainty\
    \ in multi-stakeholder hydrological systems can be reduced with the assistance\
    \ of \nimmutably recorded data. Likewise, blockchain technology is very suitable\
    \ for applications in the \nfinance of water. Application areas may be the water\
    \ market, where water rights are exchanged, \nor any investment in water management\
    \ and donations to improve water infrastructure or sanitation \nin developing\
    \ countries. In short, it provides the most transparent follow-up of all financial\
    \ \ntransactions in terms of investors or market stakeholders (Wheeler et al.,\
    \ 2014). Similarly, when \nthere is a necessity for the traceability of water,\
    \ blockchain may provide effective solutions. Water-\nrelated traceability will\
    \ be critical for agricultural water management (Yildirim and Demir, 2022), \n\
    water quality and control (Demir et al., 2009), urban water systems, and the water\
    \ footprint of a \nspecial product. \n \n2. Research Methodology \nA systematic\
    \ literature review on blockchain applications in hydrology and water resources\
    \ was \nperformed for this study (Bramer et al., 2018). The literature review\
    \ was initially divided into two \nareas including academic and non-academic use\
    \ cases. The academic literature review includes \njournal and conference papers,\
    \ book chapters, and technical reports. The non-academic literature \nreview includes\
    \ whitepapers, web documents, reports of official institutions, and hackathon\
    \ \nprojects. \nGoogle Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Crossref, Open Alex, Jisc\
    \ Library Hub, and the \nLibrary of Congress were used as academic databases,\
    \ and 25 different keyword combinations \nwere used as a systematic search approach\
    \ (Table A1 in Appendix). After the initial search, the \nresults published before\
    \ 2008 (before the Bitcoin whitepaper) in the database search results were \n\
    eliminated. Later on, results that are indexed in more than one database were\
    \ ultimately removed, \nso that no duplicates remained. There were 5,330 articles\
    \ as a result of the research from these \nstages. These papers were examined\
    \ according to their titles, abstracts, and the content of the paper, \nand classified\
    \ according to their scope of the application. Especially the collections of conference\
    \ \nproceedings with a wide scope were caught by keyword combinations, although\
    \ they did not \ncontain any useful content on blockchain and hydrology. Moreover,\
    \ results containing only one or \ntwo sentences about “blockchain and water”\
    \ were also excluded from the review. It was expected \nthat there would be at\
    \ least a few paragraphs or a section that included useful comments or analysis\
    \ \non the subject matter. \nFor the review of non-academic use cases, hackathon\
    \ projects were retrieved following the \nsame search approach described above,\
    \ using the public projects repository of Devpost (Wang et \nal., 2018). The web\
    \ pages that detail technological content and official reports with digital \n\
    transformation content were manually examined, and a non-academic content list\
    \ that falls under \nthe subject of this study was prepared. Finally, 103 academic\
    \ and 57 non-academic pieces of \ncontent were found directly relevant, and subjected\
    \ to a detailed review. Tables for a detailed \nreview are given as an appendix.\
    \ \nFor the reviewed academic content, several variables and categorization parameters\
    \ were \nselected to evaluate the current maturation process of blockchain technology\
    \ for hydrological \napplications as follows: \nPublication Type: Indicates where\
    \ and in what format academic content is published including \njournal paper,\
    \ conference paper, book, book chapter, thesis, and technical report.  \nFocus\
    \ Area: Classification of reviewed studies based on their focus on the sub-field\
    \ of hydrology \nand water resources. Although most studies focus on more than\
    \ one area, as a result of detailed \nanalysis, it was assumed that the study\
    \ was primarily focused on a single subject area. These \nsubject areas are classified\
    \ as follows: urban water management, water quality management, \nwater economics,\
    \ water governance, agricultural water management, water and sustainable \ndevelopment\
    \ goals (SDG) \nPurpose: Indicates the main use cases the study or product is\
    \ designed to address. \nDevelopment Level of Blockchain Application: Indicates\
    \ the degree to which the blockchain \ntechnology was used in the study. \nExplore:\
    \ Studies highlight the potential of blockchain applications in water resources\
    \ \nmanagement and hydrology and evaluate research and application gaps. Studies\
    \ classified in \nthis field are just for exploration and do not include blockchain\
    \ parameters. Therefore, these \nstudies were not examined for the following fields.\
    \  \nConceptual: Studies that propose a digital system architecture without a\
    \ tested application or \ncode list. \nSimulation: Studies in which a system is\
    \ designed, coded, and tested mostly in virtual machines \nbut not converted into\
    \ a real-world application. \nDecentralized Application (DApp): Studies in which\
    \ the system created can be used with a \nmobile or web-based application by designing\
    \ a special interface. The current activity of the \napplication created in the\
    \ studies or whether it is currently at the service of the users has not \nbeen\
    \ examined. \nPilot Project: Studies where any stage of the project is tested\
    \ with real-time data. \nBlockchain Type: It is a classification made according\
    \ to which type of blockchain infrastructure \nthe study proposes or uses. Since\
    \ the studies are divided into blockchain types at a very general \nlevel, they\
    \ are categorized as Public, Private, and Hybrid Blockchain, which contains the\
    \ \nfeatures of both types to a certain extent. \nBlockchain Technology: It is\
    \ a categorization made according to which blockchain technology \nprovider the\
    \ study proposes to use or uses. Studies were classified as Ethereum, Hyperledger,\
    \ \nand Other as a result of the review. \nSmart Contract/Chain Code Enabled:\
    \ A Boolean field specifying if the study includes a smart \ncontract or chain\
    \ code.  \nReproducibility: It determines if the blockchain application of the\
    \ study could be reproduced by \nusing the information provided. The classification\
    \ is carried out according to sharing level of \ndata and codebase as \"Yes\"\
    , \"No”, and \"Partly\".  \nCybersecurity Test: Evaluation of studies according\
    \ to whether they were subjected to cyber \nsecurity tests or not. \nOn-Chain\
    \ Data: Blockchain-based stored data is specified.  \nOff-Chain Data: Data stored\
    \ in the standard database are specified. \nConsensus Algorithm: Evaluation of\
    \ the consensus algorithm used by the blockchain \ninfrastructure used in the\
    \ study.  \nFeasibility Analysis: Provides a feasibility analysis for the blockchain-based\
    \ system components \ninvolved in the studies. \n \n3. Results \n3.1. Summary\
    \ of Findings \nThis section presents and examines graphical summaries of the\
    \ reviewed papers and non-academic \ncontent. The summarized graphical demonstration\
    \ includes the distribution of papers and non-\nacademic content by year and publication\
    \ type. Moreover, graphs about reviewed papers provide \ntechnical details about\
    \ blockchain use cases such as the application in the sub-field of hydrology,\
    \ \nthe development level of a blockchain application, the type of blockchain,\
    \ and the blockchain \nnetwork. \nA table showing the summarized information of\
    \ 103 papers and 57 non-academic content is \nincluded in the appendix (Table\
    \ A2 and A3). Considering the distribution of papers by years, an \napproximately\
    \ linear increase is observed. This trend can be explained by the increase in\
    \ the \napplication areas of blockchain technology and the increase in the exploration\
    \ and adoption of \nmodern technologies in hydrological processes. The number\
    \ of papers in 2022 seems not to have \nexceeded the previous two years yet. Considering\
    \ that the papers reviewed cover the period before \nOctober 15, 2022, this number\
    \ may support the continuing linear increase. In addition, sharp \nfluctuations\
    \ in cryptocurrency exchanges may have limited the applications of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology in different areas. Non-academic content production appears to\
    \ follow a steady \nuptrend, with the exception of a drastic dive in 2020. (Figure\
    \ 2). \n \n \nFigure 2. Distribution of academic and non-academic content by years\
    \ \n \nReviewed papers are classified as \"journal papers,\" \"conference papers,\"\
    \ \"book chapters,\" \n\"books,\" \"theses,\" \"working papers,\" and \"technical\

    \ at different conferences, both conference papers were considered. \nContents\

    \ While there is a dominance of journal and \nconference papers in the reviewed\
    \ papers, the number of postgraduate theses can be considered \nvery low. The\
    \ reason for this can be interpreted as the immature level of integration between\
    \ the \nacademic blockchain ecosystem and the hydroinformatics community, and\
    \ as a result, the \ndifficulty of finding a suitable use case to support a thesis\
    \ contribution as well as advisors \nexperienced in this interdisciplinary area.\
    \ Reviewed non-academic content is divided into three \npublication types including\
    \ web documents, whitepapers, and hackathon projects (Figure 3). \nProjects that\
    \ published whitepaper emphasize the potential applications instead of providing\
    \ real-\ntime hydrological application. Hackathon projects are the output of hackathon\
    \ events that directly \nfocus on hydrological processes. \n \n \nFigure 3. Distribution\
    \ of academic and non-academic content by publication type \n \nAnother classification\
    \ of reviewed papers is carried out according to their major contribution \nto\
    \ sub-fields of hydrology. Although most papers focused on more than one sub-field,\
    \ they were \ncategorized in the hydrology sub-field that was considered to be\
    \ the most focused area (Figure 4). \nWater Governance: These papers generally\
    \ anticipate using blockchain as a database and focus \non solving administrative\
    \ problems and building trust among stakeholders. Papers providing a \nliterature\
    \ review are also categorized here. \nWater Quality Management: These papers focus\
    \ on problems related to water quality, such as \nmonitoring, analysis, wastewater\
    \ management, and a more transparent demonstration of water \nquality standards\
    \ being met. \nWater Economics: These papers focus on approaches to water markets\
    \ at different scales for \nwater trading, water rights, water claims, and water\
    \ economy applications. \nAgricultural Water Management: These papers focus on\
    \ agriculture-related water problems \nsuch as irrigation and agricultural water\
    \ quality.  \n49\n32\n10\n6\n3\n2\n1\n24\n19\n14\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\

    \ The distribution of the development level of blockchain applications shows that\
    \ the \nhydrology applications are still in the maturation stage (Figure 5). It\
    \ is noteworthy that few studies \ninclude an application as an end product or\
    \ a pilot project with a real-world active use case. The \nnumber of studies in\
    \ the Water SDG category would have been greater if other studies had been \n\
    focused on their potential contribution to sustainable development goals. \n \n\

    Number of Content\nBlockchain Network\nThe \"N/A\" column in Figure 6 and Figure\
    \ 7; represents the same articles as the \"Explore\" \ncolumn, which does not\
    \ suggest an architecture or system but simply explores potential \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology. Therefore, a blockchain type or a blockchain network\
    \ is \nout of the question, as the study only explores potential applications.\
    \ If a system or architecture is \nsuggested but no blockchain network or blockchain\
    \ type is specified in the paper, it is categorized \nas \"Not Available.\" The\
    \ reason why private blockchains are preferred more may be that the water-\nrelated\
    \ data in the use case is not intended to be shared transparently even if the\
    \ identities are \ncryptographically secure because most of the papers contain\
    \ conceptual and simulation studies. \nMoreover, fluctuating cryptocurrency markets\
    \ may be creating concerns about transaction fees to \nbe paid on public blockchains.\
    \ Ethereum and Hyperledger dominate the field of hydrology as well \nas other\
    \ application fields due to smart contract and private blockchain compatibility.\
    \ Other private \nblockchains represented in the review were Corda and BanQu.\
    \ \n \n3.2. Analysis of Academic Content  \nIn this section, the reviewed academic\
    \ content is briefly summarized. These summaries highlight \nthe papers' approach\
    \ to blockchain and hydrology integration. \n \n3.2.1. Water Governance \nThe\
    \ common consensus is that trust is a critical enabler in water governance. Reliable\
    \ data and \ncoordination are essential to establishing and maintaining the trust\
    \ layer. Blockchain provides an \nimmutable database to store water-related data\
    \ securely. This key feature of blockchain technology \nprovides a straightforward\
    \ framework for water governance stakeholder coordination. Moreover, \nsmart contracts\
    \ can contribute to sustainable water governance by codifying environmental and\
    \ \neconomic conditions. Sobrinho et al. (2019) describe how blockchain technology\
    \ can help to \nenhance financial transparency and trust while also helping to\
    \ improve water governance. Such an \nenhancement might be made possible, for\
    \ example, by the development of cryptocurrencies and \nthe use of smart contracts\
    \ to encourage actions aimed at water resource conservation. Sriyono \n(2020)\
    \ investigates the potential of blockchain technology to aid in the efficient\
    \ management of \nwater resources and offers a framework and architecture for\
    \ blockchain and water management. \nThe paper also discusses a potential blockchain-based\
    \ solution for the water quality problems in \nPuerto Rico. Scozzari et al. (2021)\
    \ examine how IoT, AI, and blockchain are used to digitally \ntransform smart\
    \ water networks and blockchain-enabled water rights trading.  \nDogo et al. (2019)\
    \ examine the effects of combining blockchain technologies with intelligent \n\
    water management and assert that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize\
    \ water and \nsanitation governance to achieve SDG 6 as envisioned by the United\
    \ Nations in 2035, through \ncreative, effective, and scalable solutions, based\
    \ on these two technologies in African cities. Poonia \net al. (2021) examine\
    \ the spatiotemporal distribution of several drought types, separately and \n\
    simultaneously, in India. A blockchain-based framework is suggested to enhance\
    \ the current \ndrought risk-management system to make it easier for those who\
    \ have died from drought to receive \nhelp and aid as soon as possible. Linjing\
    \ et al. (2020) explain the benefits and standout \ncharacteristics of blockchain-enabled\
    \ IoT applications and contrast them with centralized, more \nestablished IoT-based\
    \ smart water systems. Hangan et al. (2022) examine the potential \napplications\
    \ of big data and blockchain in the field of water resources and argue that blockchain\
    \ \ncan act as a link between a locally used solution and a global infrastructure\
    \ that is accessible \nglobally and is controlled by a coalition of international\
    \ organizations using consensus \nmechanisms.  \nIyer and Giri (2020) evaluate\
    \ water-related issues that may be solved by blockchain, which \nwill be important\
    \ in the area of ethical pricing and highlight data transparency as data is exchanged\
    \ \nacross networks for water reuse. Wu et al. (2022) thoroughly examine the properties\
    \ of blockchain \ntechnology, as well as the scenarios and applications that blockchain\
    \ has in the field of protecting \nwater resources, including the storage of data\
    \ about water bodies, cross-sectoral collaboration, and \nincreased public involvement\
    \ level. According to Ragghianti (2021), blockchain allows for the \nintegration\
    \ of watershed monitoring and direct management of water usage for all system\
    \ users, \nmaintaining flexibility and guaranteeing all socio-environmental constraints\
    \ that apply in that \nbasin. Xia et al. (2022) consider a distributed and decentralized\
    \ water data management system for \nthe whole supply, consumption, and discharge\
    \ processes. The system includes two conceptual \nhybrid blockchain-based application\
    \ scenarios: permits for water abstraction and water quality \ntracking. Singh\
    \ and Goel (2020) examine how blockchain might be used to notify authorities of\
    \ \nany emergency flood events.  \nYasuno et al. (2020) integrate upstream monitoring,\
    \ dam inflow prediction, a smart contract \nenabled blockchain framework to reimagine\
    \ the dam watershed as a smart dam and organize the \ntechnologies for flood prediction.\
    \ Study aims to facilitate real-time coordination among \nstakeholders and real-time\
    \ broadcast of disaster prevention information. Lin and Wang (2021) \nclaim that\
    \ SPOF and DDOS attacks have the potential to exploit the authentication and key\
    \ \nagreement in intelligent water conservation systems, thus suggesting a blockchain-based\
    \ \nauthentication key agreement system for smart water devices. The selected\
    \ network for blockchain \nis Ethereum, and to participate in the Ethereum network,\
    \ smart devices serve as light nodes. The \nlight node does not engage in mining\
    \ and merely downloads a small bit of the blockchain network. \nIt is appropriate\
    \ for conditions where there are more smart devices. The consensus algorithm for\
    \ \nthe blockchain system is Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).  \nAsgari\
    \ and Nemati (2022) investigate the literature based on the three primary Distributed\
    \ \nLedger Technology (DLT) application areas of Smart Water Systems, Water Quality\
    \ Monitoring, \nand Storm Water Management. Additionally, they address the legislative,\
    \ social, administrative, \nand practical difficulties which can be an obstacle\
    \ to the use of blockchain technology. Stankovic \net al. (2020) provide an overview\
    \ of possible blockchain-enabled applications in water and \nsanitation services\
    \ for Latin America and the Caribbean. Li et al. (2021) provide a peer-to-peer\
    \ \nblockchain system based on data to forecast water consumption. There are four\
    \ layers in the \nframework: i) the storage layer; ii) the network layer; iii)\
    \ the smart contract layer; and iv) the \napplication layer. \nZhang et al. (2020)\
    \ establish a platform with four decentralized participants, such as \ngovernment\
    \ agencies, water conservation private sector actors, the general public, and\
    \ third-party \nmaintenance. The study also provides the design of “dual chain”\
    \ smart contracts that are \"alliance \nchain and private chain.\" Additionally,\
    \ the many possibilities of blockchain-enabled platform \napplications for smart\
    \ water conservation are examined. Next, a novel development route \nincluding\
    \ consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, asymmetric encryption, and information\
    \ source \ntracing is suggested using the water rights trading market as an example.\
    \ Chinese Smart Water \nConservancy Platform Data is the main on-chain data in\
    \ the proposed system. Youssef et al. (2019) \nsuggest an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV), cloud-based solution for dam site monitoring. The \nUAVs periodically\
    \ provide meteorological data, water quality and level information, and the \n\
    condition of dam structures.  Blockchain, which offers identification, a database\
    \ system, and \ntraceability of the UAV cloud's data transmission, ensures a distributed\
    \ and long-term security \nsolution. The effectiveness of the solution is simulated\
    \ by assessing the data delivery delay ratio.  \nMajia (2021) creates a blockchain-based\
    \ system that maintains the privacy of operational \nhydropower plant data. The\
    \ proposed system stores the homomorphic encrypted operational data \non chain.\
    \ Sukrutha et al. (2021) establish a unique blockchain architecture with double\
    \ hashing as \na data storage system that is more secure for groundwater management\
    \ data. The water level and \nwater quality data of aquifers are stored off-chain,\
    \ but the hash of the same data is stored on-chain. \nThe simulation is carried\
    \ out, and the transactional cost is examined. Simulation results show that \n\
    storing the hash of data is cost-effective. Mohammadi et al. (2022) create a hypothetical\
    \ \nblockchain-based system to securely exchange data gathered in real-time from\
    \ a variety of sensors \nfor monitoring and controlling water consumption. The\
    \ proposed consensus algorithm is proof of \nwork, and smart water meter data\
    \ is supposed to be directly stored on-chain.  \nDramski et al. (2019) describe\
    \ a system for gathering environmental data from meteorological \nsensors and\
    \ then storing it in a blockchain application. The application is powered by a\
    \ private \nHyperledger blockchain network and a sensor prototype developed on\
    \ a Raspberry Pi. Tiwari et \nal. (2020) suggest a public Ethereum-based blockchain\
    \ system designed to preserve water \nconsumption that satisfies the supply-demand\
    \ processes of all customers in a peer-to-peer network. \nVernekar (2020) outlines\
    \ a fully decentralized, blockchain-based approach for managing water \nsupply\
    \ that uses IoT devices to collect data along the configuration and add it to\
    \ the Ethereum \npublic blockchain.  \nSapra et al. (2021) provide a methodology\
    \ for creating an intelligent water management system \nthat determines and calculates\
    \ a consumer's water use within a certain area and also detects leaks \nin the\
    \ plumbing system. A private blockchain network is designed based on Ethereum,\
    \ and water \nquality, pressure, and location data for components of the water\
    \ distribution system are stored on \nthe block. The California Blockchain Working\
    \ Group (2020) investigates the potential for \nblockchain-based technology to\
    \ assist in the development of a more effective framework that \nbuilds on the\
    \ momentum of recent California water-related data initiatives. There are two\
    \ pilot \nproject-level studies in this category in the reviewed literature. Mughal\
    \ et al. (2022) conduct a pilot \nproject emphasizing blockchain-enabled solutions\
    \ for enhancing Pakistan's data-intensive \ndecision-support systems. The consistency,\
    \ immutability, and dependability of streamflow time \nseries data were maintained\
    \ using a private blockchain that was built on the Hyperledger Fabric \nplatform.\
    \ The model evaluated the use of Hyperledger fabric, employing the distributed\
    \ \nautonomous administrative authority of Pakistan's irrigation network. In addition\
    \ to collecting \nsensor data for streamflow prediction, the nodes also maintain\
    \ permanent data storage on the \nstreamflow record and aggregate and approve\
    \ compliance with the distribution system via \nchaincode (smart contracts). The\
    \ proof of authority protocol allows the designated nodes with \nauthorization\
    \ to create new blocks of streamflow data monitoring irrigation networks, thus\
    \ \nmaintaining the chain's overall security.  \nAnother pilot project is carried\
    \ out by Coli et al. (2021). The pilot project in Peru aims to \ndemonstrate the\
    \ viability of integrating blockchain technology into the microfinance industry\
    \ for \nwater and sanitation to increase the effectiveness of the current microfinance\
    \ model and support \nthe inclusion of unbanked people in the financial system.\
    \ Pilot study also allows for more discovery \nthrough first-hand experiences\
    \ with local microfinance organizations and borrowers. The private \nblockchain\
    \ network of BanQu is preferred for the project, and a feasibility analysis is\
    \ conducted \nto show operationally cost-effective scenarios as a result of blockchain\
    \ implementation. \n \n3.2.2. Water Economics  \nWater economics is the consideration\
    \ of the economic value of water as a natural resource and the \nadded value it\
    \ creates in the areas where it is used within the framework of microeconomic\
    \ \ntheories. The focus of these theories is to maintain the quality and quantity\
    \ of water under \neconomic and financial constraints and to make water-related\
    \ investment, cost and water markets \nefficient. The water economics has been\
    \ a substantial area of research for exploring blockchain \napplications due to\
    \ its intrinsic need for and obvious utility of adopting trustworthy data and\
    \ \ncurrency sharing mechanisms. Bhaduri et al. (2021) investigate the opportunities\
    \ for potential \nwater market implementation in Los Angeles, USA, and Bengaluru,\
    \ India. Poberezhna (2018) \nexplores how blockchain-based tools could assist\
    \ the water sector's businesses and governing \nbodies in gaining access to real-time\
    \ data about market shares, consumption trends, consumer bill \nmanagement, and\
    \ other possibilities. Ikeda and Liffiton (2019) introduce two possible use cases\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based water management: i) blockchain-based water and sanitation\
    \ subsidies, and \nii) using blockchain tools to manage water pricing and consumption.\
    \  \nBou Abdo and Zeadally (2020) create a commercially and economically viable\
    \ peer-to-peer \ntrading platform for water and energy that supports rainwater\
    \ gathering and trade of the captured \nwater. The rainwater harvested data is\
    \ directly stored on-chain. Thomason et al. (2018) examine \nthe relationship\
    \ between blockchain technology and climate finance as both relate to the problem\
    \ \nof water scarcity in poor nations and propose blockchain-based water trading\
    \ applications as a \npotential solution. Zhao et al. (2019) underline the significance\
    \ of creating a peer-to-peer trading \nnetwork with blockchain capabilities that\
    \ would enable more irrigators to take part in the platform \nthat secures and\
    \ transparently allocates water, increasing the total efficiency of water resources.\
    \ \nZecchini (2019) investigates the potential application scenarios for blockchain-enabled\
    \ water \nquality credit systems. Grigoras et al. (2018) introduce blockchain\
    \ and smart contracts integrated \ninto a theoretical water rights trading platform.\
    \ Angara and Saripalle (2022) review the virtual \nwater literature systematically\
    \ and provide a conceptual virtual water currency and blockchain-\nenabled virtual\
    \ water trade system. Sivaramakrishnan (2020) proposes a blockchain-enabled \n\
    architecture for water trading platforms between agricultural stakeholders. The\
    \ Ethereum public \nnetwork is preferred to perform regulatory requirements as\
    \ smart contracts. Belliera et al. (2019) \ncreate a flood insurance system powered\
    \ by blockchain.  \nVannucci et al. (2021) extend this study and aim to contribute\
    \ to the analysis and management \nof flood events from an economic and financial\
    \ perspective from a public administration \nviewpoint. The study also entends\
    \ the unique and robust blockchain-based insurance systems. \nZhang (2022) provides\
    \ a design of a conceptual blockchain-based supply chain financial system \nmodel\
    \ for water resources businesses, and a model to analyze the financial condition\
    \ of seven \nwater businesses for their potential blockchain-based digital transformation\
    \ in China. Their \nconceptual blockchain-based architecture is designed to store\
    \ the financial supply chain of water \nresources data directly. Miller (2021)\
    \ and Ramsey et al. (2020) describe and evaluate the \napplication of blockchain\
    \ capabilities to the water rights trading ecosystem and design a variety of \n\
    services that leverage blockchain features and business value. Pee et al. (2018)\
    \ and Alcarria et al. \n(2018) examine the potential for a simple peer-to-peer\
    \ water market based on smart contracts with \nwater trading data stored on the\
    \ Ethereum private network. Liu and Shang (2022) propose hybrid \nblockchain approach\
    \ for trading water rights and Li et al. (2022b) use chain code to enable \ntransactional\
    \ water rights data storage in a private Hyperledger Fabric network for the same\
    \ \npurpose. \nThis category contains one study at the DApp level and one study\
    \ at the pilot project level. \nAbu-Amara et al. (2022) develop a blockchain-based\
    \ application to manage the supply of water \nand energy transactions. The application\
    \ records water and energy use data on a private \nHyperledger network and allows\
    \ consumers to view and pay bills online. CRCNA (2020) provides \na pilot project\
    \ with Civic Ledger, an Australian start-up, in Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply\
    \ \nScheme (MDWSS), Northern Australia. Water Ledger, which is Civic Ledger's\
    \ water trading \nplatform built on Ethereum, is customized to the MDWSS business\
    \ and operational standards to \nexamine how blockchain technology can minimize\
    \ trading costs, boost the effectiveness of trade \nprocesses, and raise water\
    \ market transparency. The pilot project highlights that blockchain-\nenabled\
    \ systems have the potential to codify regulatory rules, reduce transaction costs,\
    \ and avoid \nasymmetric information about actual water prices. The main challenge\
    \ for the next phases of the \nproject is that the existing water market and the\
    \ water delivery infrastructure are not interoperable. \n \n3.2.3.  Water Quality\
    \ Management \nWater quality management is the entire process of monitoring the\
    \ water quality from the source to \nthe user, taking measures to protect the\
    \ water quality, and treating the water if necessary. In this \nwhole process,\
    \ reliable data and real-time monitoring are vital for the detection of possible\
    \ \ncontamination and the efficiency of the treatment process. Kassou et al. (2020)\
    \ propose a \nblockchain-enabled conceptual system design to control and track\
    \ medical wastewater \ninfrastructure. Damania et al. (2019) consider the blockchain\
    \ as a next-generation data storage \nsystem and discuss potential integration\
    \ in terms of water quality management. Ortiz (2018) points \nout the capabilities\
    \ of blockchain applications to improve public awareness and governmental \naccountability\
    \ about water quality at all scales in Puerto Rico. Yan et al. (2019) present\
    \ a \nconceptual blockchain-enabled environmental monitoring system architecture\
    \ that data analysis, \nstakeholder authentication and water quality data are\
    \ synchronized. Wan et al. 2020) deliver an \nAI-supported management system for\
    \ wastewater treatment facilities and investigate blockchain \nas a data storage\
    \ system.  \nHakak et al. (2020) conceptualize a blockchain-enabled smart contract-supported\
    \ industrial \nwastewater management system. Quist-Aphetsi and Blankson (2019)\
    \ explores the cryptographic \nfeatures of Secure Hash Function 256, which is\
    \ the most popular hash function in blockchain \napplications, and examine a potential\
    \ hybrid data logging system that store cryptographically the \nquality of water\
    \ delivered to consumers from the water treatment plant. Kaur and Oza (2020) \n\
    document the Ethereum Request for Comment Standards 20 (ERC20) from a smart city\
    \ \nperspective that Ethereum-based tokens must comply with. The paper simulates\
    \ the Water \nReprocessing Coins (WRC) to create a business environment where\
    \ everyone has an equal chance \nof obtaining credits based on recycled wastewater\
    \ to remove inequalities between different-scale \nenterprises. Iyer et al. (2019)\
    \ propose a private blockchain network based on Hyperledger to \nmaximize the\
    \ effectiveness of wastewater recycling systems for industries. The study's simulation\
    \ \nprocess includes anomaly detection algorithms to apply chaincode rules for\
    \ possible penalties to \nindustries attempting to tamper with water quality sensors.\
    \  \nLin et al. (2020) simulate an integrated system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ that is structured \nas a directed acyclic graph and uses geographic information\
    \ system tools for source tracking of \nriver water quality problems. Berman et\
    \ al. (2020) provide an implementation of a blockchain-\nenabled framework for\
    \ sample identification and logging together with small autonomous boats \nthat\
    \ can navigate to measure chemical water quality parameters automatically. Niya\
    \ et al. (2018) \npropose an IoT-enabled LoRa-based system for monitoring water\
    \ pollution that is completely \ndecentralized by storing and retrieving data\
    \ from IoT sensors on the Ethereum blockchain network. \nCrawford et al. (2021)\
    \ create an R3 Corda-based DLT system for oil and gas underground injection \n\
    control (UIC) operations to maintain the water quality of freshwater aquifers.\
    \ Gudmundsson and \nHougaard (2021) create a model that explicitly demonstrates\
    \ the influence of water quality on \nproduction profits and offer a plan for\
    \ distributing the profits of the best possible pollution \nabatement. In order\
    \ to automate negotiations, the paper offers a decentralized solution using smart\
    \ \ncontracts. \nThe DApp level categorized in this section is conducted by Alharbi\
    \ et al. (2021). Initially, the \nstudy focuses on measuring the water quality\
    \ parameters in industrial tanks and looking for any \nviolations using IoT (Internet\
    \ of Things). Afterward, Hyperledger's private application is used to \nenforce\
    \ the necessary penalties on the violating industrial facility and sustain the\
    \ accuracy, \ndependability, and transparency of the records of violations. The\
    \ technology will be able to \nmeasure the quality of the water in real time and\
    \ enable the immediate identification of any \nviolation to apply the appropriate\
    \ penalties. The administration can access the decentralized web \napplication\
    \ to track the status of water measures for registered industrial facilities and\
    \ evaluate the \ndata linked to water violations with easy-to-read illustrations.\
    \ Shi et al. (2019) present a cutting-\nedge IoT solution that uses a Hyperledger\
    \ private network to preserve healthy drinking water \nconsumption in schools.\
    \ It is mentioned that 39 schools have already implemented the project in \nHangzhou's\
    \ Shangcheng District, China. The project reduces the workload of health professionals\
    \ \nand encourages the transformation from conventional site-based inspection\
    \ to automated remote \nmonitoring. \n \n3.2.4.  Agricultural Water Management\
    \ \nAgricultural water management aims to provide the optimum amount and quality\
    \ of water for \nagricultural products by considering the continuity of ecosystem\
    \ services. This optimization is \npossible by prioritizing data security related\
    \ to agricultural water management processes, Dong \nand Fu (2021), Liu et al.\
    \ (2020) and Kumar et al. (2021) examine possible applications for \nblockchain-based\
    \ digital solutions in the agricultural industry and assess the transformation\
    \ \nprocess of traditional agriculture to blockchain-based digitalized smart agriculture\
    \ systems. Liu et \nal. (2021) and Ferrag et al. (2020) provide a systematic review\
    \ of information communication \ntechnologies (ICT) and blockchain-enabled agricultural\
    \ applications.  \nDragulinescu et al. (2021) propose a blockchain-enabled conceptual\
    \ system to maximize smart \nirrigation by storing the water quality, air quality,\
    \ and weather data on chain. Dragulinescu et al. \n(2021) extend the conceptualized\
    \ framework and perform simulation studies to store and monitor \nsome physical\
    \ and chemical water quality parameters for irrigation networks, such as temperature,\
    \ \ndissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. Chang et al. (2021) offer a conceptual\
    \ Ethereum-based \nirrigation system that stores agricultural supply and demand\
    \ data on-chain. Krishna et al. (2021) \nprovide a smart agricultural system architecture\
    \ that stores soil moisture and temperature on \nblockchain to protect agricultural\
    \ data security. Sakthi and DafniRose (2022) propose a \nHyperledger private network\
    \ to provide data transparency and reliability for agricultural \nstakeholders\
    \ to encourage them to reduce pesticide and fertilizer-based water and soil pollution.\
    \ \nLin et al. (2017) discuss the potential blockchain applications and propose\
    \ an architecture based \non ICT and hybrid Ethereum network integration.  \n\
    RajaRajeswari et al. (2022) provide a blockchain-enabled conceptualized framework\
    \ for smart \ngardening as a component of the smart city concept. Munir et al.\
    \ (2019) and Ting et al. (2022) \npropose a smart irrigation system that uses\
    \ fuzzy logic-based algorithms for decision-support \nprocesses and blockchain\
    \ for data reliability. Zeng et al. (2021) simulate a system for managing \nand\
    \ coordinating the usage of high-quality seeds and water resources between communities;\
    \ an \neffective tracking system for seed quality and a smart irrigation management\
    \ system are designed \nusing IoT and blockchain integration. Giaffreda et al.\
    \ (2019), Bordel et al. (2019) and Pincheira et \nal. (2021) provide Ethereum-based\
    \ agricultural water management systems which include private, \nhybrid, and public\
    \ networks respectively. These three studies provide a system that encourages\
    \ \nand rewards ethical behavior in agriculture activities for specific multi-stakeholder\
    \ ecosystems. \nThe main aim of these studies is to create more sustainable and\
    \ environmentally friendly irrigation \nwater consumption system. \nEnescu et\
    \ al. (2020) describe a DApp that is centered on bringing together small farming\
    \ \ncommunities for effective solar panel-based agricultural management. The DApp\
    \ is suggested for \nmanaging both energy and water. The system uses the Ethereum\
    \ public network and smart \ncontracts, which enable customers to trade energy\
    \ and water. ERC20 is implemented for \ntransactions, and two cryptocurrencies\
    \ are introduced including SIST (Small Irrigation System \nToken) and Solar Coin.\
    \  \n \n3.2.5.  Urban Water Management \nUrban water management aims to perform\
    \ urban water services in an integrated manner. The main \nelements of urban water\
    \ management are water supply, drainage and treatment facilities. The \naccountability\
    \ of the urban water authority can become more sustainable within the framework\
    \ of \nblockchain. Alnahari and Ariaratnam (2022), Lukić et al. (2022), Makani\
    \ et al. (2022), Kim et al. \n(2022) and Kumar et al. (2022) investigate the possible\
    \ blockchain application for smart cities. It \nis summarized that blockchain\
    \ has the potential to enhance water security and accountability \nthrough the\
    \ distribution of transparent, secure ledger accounts. In addition, water quantity\
    \ and \nquality can be tracked for whole water supply and demand processes including\
    \ storage, \ntransmission, treatment, and consumption. Public awareness and trust\
    \ layer between citizens are \nthe main contributions of blockchain and smart\
    \ city integration.  \nMahmoud et al., (2019) examine the viability of combining\
    \ Blockchain with intelligent water \nnetworks through case studies. Additionally,\
    \ identity anonymity methods that could be integrated \nwith the system and the\
    \ customer's data are explored, and a distributed ledger and blockchain-\nbased\
    \ data aggregation mechanism for the smart meters are suggested. They extend this\
    \ study and \ndesign a MATLAB toolbox that can simulate blockchain-enabled water\
    \ distribution systems. \nDifferent algorithms for consensus mechanisms in blockchain\
    \ are compared according to their \nmining time and giving the user the option\
    \ to select the desired one (Mahmoud et al. 2021). Lalle \net al. (2020) present\
    \ the use of blockchain technology with the machine learning algorithm k-\nmeans\
    \ to preserve user privacy. Users are grouped into clusters, and every cluster\
    \ has a \npermissioned blockchain to store the data of its members.  \nZecchini\
    \ et al. (2020) introduce particular fields in their description, and they describe\
    \ the use \nof Solidity design patterns applied to urban water management scenarios\
    \ to provide blockchain \ndevelopers with greater assistance in making important\
    \ decisions to create effective decentralized \napplications. Sundaresan et al.\
    \ (2021) propose a blockchain-enabled system that stores the \nquantitative and\
    \ qualitative data of water distribution systems. Thakur et al. (2021) provide\
    \ an \nincentive-based architecture for smart water distribution and saving that\
    \ combines blockchain \ntechnology with edge computing. In the framework, houses\
    \ are designed as nodes of the Ethereum-\nbased network. The computation operates\
    \ at the network's edge and offers a quick water-saving \nincentive system. Arsene\
    \ et al. (2020) and Pahontu et al. (2020) are similar studies that provide a \n\
    water supply system integrated with Hyperledger to manage customer demand more\
    \ effectively. \nRottondi and Verticale (2017) propose a public blockchain-enabled\
    \ smart water metering \narchitecture and a serious gaming platform to incentivize\
    \ sustainable urban water consumption. \nPredescu et al. (2021) develop a system\
    \ at the application level that provides a serious gaming \napproach for urban\
    \ water management from the standpoint of mobile crowd sensing. Each \ncrowdsensing\
    \ task includes a chaincode-based incentive mechanism, and the trust layer of\
    \ the \nsystem is secured by Hyperledger Fabric.  \n \n3.2.6.  Water and SDGs\
    \ \nSDG-6 aims at sustainable water and sanitation services for all. Mora et al.\
    \ (2021) outline the key \nsustainability concerns that cryptocurrency and blockchain\
    \ technologies are addressing in terms \nof SDG-6 Clean Water and Sanitation.\
    \ Le Sève et al. (2018) and Parmentola et al. (2021) provide \na literature review\
    \ about the potential of blockchain for improvements in environmental \nsustainability.\
    \ Mattila et al. (2022) investigate the potential of blockchain-enabled data storage\
    \ \nsystems for their contribution to reaching SDG targets such as climate change,\
    \ biodiversity loss, \nand water scarcity. \n \n3.3. Analysis of Non-Academic\
    \ Content  \nIn this section, the reviewed non-academic content is briefly summarized.\
    \ Web documents \ngenerally focus on the potential of blockchain for hydrological\
    \ applications and underline the \nbeneficial outputs. The most emphasized issue\
    \ is that the blockchain-based storage of hydrological \ndata creates a layer\
    \ of trust between the stakeholders who depend on the quantity and quality of\
    \ \nthe same water resource. Another issue is the advantages of blockchain-based\
    \ digitalization of \ntraditional water markets, which are currently traded, such\
    \ as accountability, easier access to \ninstant market information, and low transaction\
    \ fees.  \nWater Services Regulation Authority, a non-ministerial government department\
    \ of the UK, \npublished a report about customer data reliability and recommended\
    \ blockchain to UK water \ncompanies in 2017 (Ofwat, 2017). A digital asset platform\
    \ BANKEX introduces a pilot initiative \ncalled “water coin” that aims to generate\
    \ direct investments for clean water provision safely by \ncutting out any intermediaries\
    \ or other parties that could taint the process in Kenya (Bankex, 2018). \nFujitsu\
    \ launches a new blockchain water trading system that enables the safe use of\
    \ botanical \nwater. The botanical water harvesting process is the transformation\
    \ of food waste into drinking \nwater. Companies that want to use botanical water\
    \ can purchase it from a suitable refinery by using \na blockchain-enabled mechanism\
    \ provided by Fujitsu (Fujitsu, 2021). \nThe aims of the projects that publish\
    \ whitepapers or hackathon projects focus on to provide \nblockchain-based storage\
    \ of data on water distribution systems, detection, management, and \nprevention\
    \ of water pollution sources; ensure more reliable traceability of water-related\
    \ \ninvestments; create wastewater management layers for both treatment and environmental\
    \ \ndischarge processes; create micro water trading system for smart cities; and\
    \ create more \naccountable water supply-chain processes.  \n4. Discussion \n\
    Blockchain-enabled hydrological applications are unique to each use case and difficult\
    \ to \nstandardize but the literature has agreed on four fundamental benefits\
    \ of blockchain-based \nhydrological applications, which are described below.\
    \ \nWater Trust: Since the blockchain has a decentralized structure, none of the\
    \ stakeholders are \ndirectly the owners of the system. In addition, it is certain,\
    \ thanks to smart contracts, that \nhydrological and administrative rules are\
    \ followed by all parties. This creates a trust layer \nbetween parties that depend\
    \ on the same water source, even if they are not aware of each other. \nWater\
    \ Data Security: In the blockchain, the data is distributed among the nodes that\
    \ support the \nsystem in a completely distributed manner. This makes the system\
    \ safe from traditional \ncyberattacks and power outages. Since the data is stored\
    \ cryptographically, even if the data is \ncaptured in some way, it cannot be\
    \ disclosed unless the user wants it. It provides data security \nfor natural\
    \ and legal persons. \nImmutable Water Transaction Ledgers: Data recorded in distributed\
    \ ledgers cannot be deleted. It \nprovides a single and common database for stakeholders.\
    \ \nWater Accountability: Transactional data records on the blockchain are publicly\
    \ available for \nanyone to view and verify. There is no need for a third-party\
    \ verification system or trusted data \nprovider to verify the data. \nTheoretically,\
    \ the potential benefits of blockchain-based hydrological applications are \n\
    discussed in detail, but real-time simulation and application stage studies are\
    \ scarce in the \nliterature. Moreover, there is no blockchain-based hydrological\
    \ application where the \nenvironmental, economic, and regulatory rules are coded\
    \ as smart contracts and real-time data is \nprocessed. Although 34% of academic\
    \ content includes simulation, application, or a pilot project, \nthe data shared\
    \ about the process is very limited. The simulation results are mostly graphical\
    \ \nrepresentation for the measured water quantity and quality. This can be explained\
    \ by the \nfluctuations in cryptocurrency exchanges affecting trust in blockchain\
    \ technology and prolonging \nthe maturation process of blockchain technology.\
    \ Blockchain technologies are currently immature \nfor large scale operational\
    \ and regulatory applications and difficult to justify for long-term \ninvestment\
    \ and commitment. \nAnother notable point in the review is that a detailed smart\
    \ contract-oriented feasibility, or \noptimization study on blockchain transaction\
    \ fees related to the simulation, application, and pilot \nproject-level studies\
    \ is very limited. The efficient design of codes in the rules determined by smart\
    \ \ncontracts has a great impact on transaction fees and can make the whole system\
    \ feasible. Moreover, \nwhile the data recorded on the blockchain is immutable,\
    \ coding the smart contract is critical. A \nvulnerability in smart contract codes\
    \ could lead to incorrect recording or manipulation of data \n(Nelaturu et al.,\
    \ 2021). A smart contract can only be as smart as the developer who codes it.\
    \  \nAnother important issue is the blockchain oracle problem. Blockchains are\
    \ isolated from \nphysical systems, so they need blockchain oracles that enable\
    \ data exchange with physical systems \n(Lo et al. 2020). IoTs that send water-related\
    \ data to the blockchain must send reliable data. \nOtherwise, the blockchain\
    \ system will store incorrect data even if the smart contract is coded \nperfectly.\
    \ In the literature, there is a lack of blockchain oracle research focused on\
    \ flowmeters and \nwater quality sensors that record water-related data and send\
    \ it to the blockchain system. Although \nthe use of Ethereum and Hyperledger\
    \ dominates the literature, due to the block structures that \nallow smart contract\
    \ design, their hydrological advantages and disadvantages against each other \n\
    are not evaluated in the literature. Similarly, the hydrological evaluation of\
    \ the advantages of \nprivate and public blockchain applications against each\
    \ other is not included in the literature. \n \n5. Recommendations for Future\
    \ Work \nExtensive research and case studies is needed with a real-time application\
    \ focus to directly observe \nand evaluate the theoretical benefits of the blockchain\
    \ technology. Research involving more real-\ntime applications will encourage\
    \ more water authorities to test the blockchain-based performance \nof their existing\
    \ systems. It is necessary to analyze the economic and financial feasibility of\
    \ the \nblockchain-based digital transformation, which includes the optimization\
    \ of the blockchain system \nitself and the digital connection with the physical\
    \ water systems. In addition, hydrology-focused \nsmart contract optimization\
    \ and blockchain oracle framework development research are essential. \nGeneralized\
    \ architectures and blockchain systems that can serve as a plug-and-play technology\
    \ to \nmany use cases and organizations are essential for realizing the potential\
    \ in hydrological \napplications such as water rights trading or urban water supply-chain.\
    \ Water authorities or \ncompanies may want to enjoy the benefits of blockchain\
    \ applications without needing to learn the \ncryptographic background. \nPrivate\
    \ and public blockchain-enabled networks have advantages and disadvantages for\
    \ a \nwater system, but there is no study in the literature focusing on this comparison.\
    \ While public \nblockchain networks provide greater accountability, there are\
    \ higher transaction fees. This issue \nshould be discussed in particular within\
    \ applications of water systems. Similarly, different \nconsensus algorithms provide\
    \ different features, however, there is a lack of hydrology-focused \ncomparison\
    \ studies about the issue.  \nTransboundary water systems management is one of\
    \ the most important areas of hydrology \nwhere stakeholders have a problem of\
    \ trust, reliable data are needed, and a common water \nmanagement approach should\
    \ be adopted (Albrecht and Gerlak, 2022). Transboundary water \nsystems are an\
    \ important field of study with great potential, considering the theoretical benefits\
    \ of \nblockchain such as accountability, transparency, and immutability. Virtual\
    \ water trade and water \nfootprint, which are other sub-branches of hydrology,\
    \ also have the potential to be digitalized with \na blockchain-oriented perspective.\
    \ The international trade of products brings with it the \ninternational flow\
    \ of virtual water (Delpasand et al., 2023). The supply chains of products can\
    \ be \nmanaged on a blockchain basis by adding water footprint and virtual water\
    \ trade data. \nThe last point to be underlined about blockchain-based applications\
    \ is the Non-Fungible \nTokens (NFT). An NFT is a type of cryptocurrency; however,\
    \ in this definition, the money in \nquestion can be any asset that has value\
    \ (Flick, 2022). Assets that can be considered NFTs include \nany piece of art,\
    \ video, tweet, a website, images, and stories that are created on social media.\
    \ NFTs \ncannot be exchanged for another identical token, as NFTs are unique and\
    \ no two are alike. This \nproperty is called \"non-fungibility,\" that is, \"\
    unchangeable.\" Public blockchains provide these \ntokens with provable rarity,\
    \ while smart contracts ensure that they are non-reproducible and \nunique. In\
    \ water resources management, any product's water footprint certificate or water\
    \ quality \ncredits can be stored as NFTs. Similarly, any investment, water-related\
    \ bill, or tax payment can be \nstored as NFTs with the limits drawn by the smart\
    \ contract, making it immutable who pays when \nand how much. \n \n6. Conclusions\
    \ \nThis paper provides a systematic literature review of applications to address\
    \ hydrological \nchallenges using blockchain technology. A total of 104 academic\
    \ publications and 37 non-\nacademic studies dealing with hydrology and water\
    \ resources were analyzed in detail. During the \nperiod of analysis covered,\
    \ between 2017 and October 15, 2022, it was observed that the number \nof publications\
    \ for blockchain-based hydrological applications has increased linearly since\
    \ 2017, \nwith an observable drop in 2020, only to continue following an uptrend.\
    \ This study evaluates the \npotential for existing application areas to be enhanced\
    \ with a more sophisticated use of blockchain \ntechnology as well as the realization\
    \ of potential new hydrological applications. \nDetailed review results demonstrate\
    \ that the blockchain-enabled hydrological applications \nhave not reached maturity.\
    \ However, there is a gap in research on hydrological applications and \nthe implementation\
    \ of water resources management projects that process and use real-time data.\
    \ \nWith more research and development to address the identified gaps, blockchain\
    \ technology holds \ngreat potential and may provide sustainable utility in the\
    \ field of hydroinformatics. \n \n7. References \nAbu-Amara, F., Alrammal, M.,\

    The global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable
    practices and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play
    a crucial role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security,
    and minimizing reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy
    consumption associated with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge
    to achieving sustainability goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on
    transitioning greenhouses towards near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy
    consumption in greenhouses refers to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy
    usage to the greatest extent possible while maintaining optimal growing conditions
    for crops. This goal encompasses reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling,
    lighting, and other operational needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources
    to power greenhouse operations. This review article offers a comprehensive overview
    of greenhouse energy consumption, with the main goal of analyzing the present
    situation, identifying key challenges, exploring potential opportunities, and
    proposing future perspectives for decreasing energy usage in greenhouse environments.
    As the focus on sustainable agricultural practices grows, the need to reduce energy
    consumption in greenhouses becomes increasingly important. The review critically
    examines current technological models and strategies applied in smart greenhouse
    applications, as well as the monitoring of microclimatic conditions inside the
    greenhouse, encompassing factors such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil
    quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover, it aims to present existing literature
    that investigates the advancement of greenhouses toward achieving significant
    reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart Greenhouse; Optimization; Control;

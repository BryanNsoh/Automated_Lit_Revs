    \ projected to increase to 9 billion by 2050,\nfood production will need to increase\
    \ from its current level. The bulk of this growth will need to\ncome from smallholder\
    \ farmers who rely on generational knowledge in their farming practices and\n\
    who live in locations where weather patterns and seasons are becoming less predictable\
    \ due to\nclimate change. The expansion of internet-connected devices is increasing\
    \ opportunities to apply\ndigital tools and services on smallholder farms, including\
    \ monitoring soil and plants in horticulture,\nwater quality in aquaculture, and\
    \ ambient environments in greenhouses. In combination with other\nfood security\
    \ eﬀorts, internet of things (IoT)-enabled precision smallholder farming has the\
    \ potential\nto improve livelihoods and accelerate low- and middle-income countries’\
    \ journey to self-reliance.\nUsing a combination of interviews, surveys and site\
    \ visits to gather information, this research\npresents a review of the current\
    \ state of the IoT for on-farm measurement, cases of successful IoT\nimplementation\
    \ in low- and middle-income countries, challenges associated with implementing\
    \ the\nIoT on smallholder farms, and recommendations for practitioners.\nKeywords:\

    1. Introduction\nIn the 1930s, one farmer in the United States could grow enough\
    \ to feed four people. Today,\none farmer can feed 155 people [1]. Approximately\
    \ 1 billion people worldwide are involved in\nagriculture, and although the total\
    \ number of farmers are declining, the demand for agricultural\ncrops is expected\
    \ to double as the world population reaches 9 billion by 2050 [2]. This will require\n\
    an increase in agricultural productivity, especially from low- and middle-income\
    \ countries (LMICs).\nRecent technological advances have contributed to the rise\
    \ of precision agriculture, enabling farmers\nto make better decisions with more\
    \ information about their soil, water, crop, and local climate [3,4].\nHowever,\
    \ uptake of these advances has been limited to commercial-scale and cash-crop\
    \ cultivation [1].\nThere is a growing body of evidence, which indicates that\
    \ the implementation of precision\nagriculture tools and practices across diﬀerent\
    \ types of farming oﬀers beneﬁts. For example, a digital\ndecision support system\
    \ (DSS) that utilized crop information provided by growers, in combination\nwith\
    \ weather data, eﬀectively alerted growers when to apply fungicide to their potatoes,\
    \ resulting\nin the eﬀective mitigation of late blight disease and more eﬃcient\
    \ fungicide use, saving them up\nto 500 USD per acre cultivated [5–7]. Another\
    \ DSS platform integrated weather data and electrical\ncapacitance sensors for\
    \ real-time monitoring of soil water content along with soil water balance and\n\
    irrigation scheduling models to provide recommendations to durum wheat farmers\
    \ on timing and\nintensity of irrigation, resulting in water savings of at least\
    \ 25% compared to traditional scheduling\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750; doi:10.3390/su12093750\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n2 of 19\n\
    practices [8]. In another common application, optical sensors attached to fertilizer\
    \ equipment measure\nthe light reﬂectance at speciﬁc wavebands, which are related\
    \ to chlorophyll content, an indicator of\nplant nitrogen (N) content, and fertilizer\
    \ is applied in that location based on the estimated N deﬁciency.\nCompared to\
    \ the grower selected constant-rate, sensor-enabled variable-rate fertilization\
    \ has been\nshown to increase corn N uptake by more than 20% [9] and save 10–15\
    \ kg N per acre of corn and cotton,\nespecially when soil N content varies year-to-year\
    \ [10].\nSmallholder farms account for a large share of agricultural production\
    \ in LMICs and help\nmaintain the genetic diversity of food supply, and mitigate\
    \ the risks of nutritional deﬁciencies and\necosystem degradation [11]. However,\
    \ they face challenges including pressures on farmland from\npopulation growth\
    \ and urbanization, and an inability to rely on generational knowledge and practices\n\
    due to climate change. Technology advances made through precision agriculture\
    \ could address\nsome of these challenges [3,12–14]. The internet-of-things (IoT)\
    \ and the services that it enables has\ncontributed to the rise of precision agriculture,\
    \ and it is being applied in smallholder agriculture [4,15,16].\nHowever, limited\
    \ research exists that reports outcomes and challenges for implementation of the\
    \ IoT\nin smallholder agriculture [3,17]. Thus, this article aims to illustrate\
    \ the current landscape of the IoT in\nsmallholder farming, summarize speciﬁc\
    \ implementation cases, and describe some of the challenges\nand recommendations\
    \ in order to direct this sector.\nA typical IoT for agriculture system consists\
    \ of the following: (i) measurement device, (ii) data\ntransmission, (iii) data\
    \ storage and analytics, (iv) feedback and implementation, and (v) project\nstructure\
    \ and support (Figure 1). The device layer consists of a sensor to measure the\
    \ parameter of\ninterest (e.g., soil moisture) and the electronics necessary to\
    \ support its functions. Devices are arranged\nin a topology and connected to\
    \ a gateway using a communication protocol in the data transmission\nlayer. Broad\
    \ coverage of cellular networks allows for frequent, and in some cases near real-time,\n\
    data transmission. Individual or aggregated measurements are received by a server\
    \ where they can be\nqueried, cleaned, and analyzed. Relevant insights are fed\
    \ back to an end-user or other IoT devices to\ninform decisions and prompt actions.\
    \ A vast catalog of existing products and services that are tailored\nfor speciﬁc\
    \ applications make each of these operations increasingly easier and provide a\
    \ lower cost to\nimplement. More detailed introductions to IoT architecture design\
    \ and theory can be found in [18,19].\nThis review primarily focuses on categories\
    \ (i) and (ii), accompanied by discussion of the implications\non (v).\nFigure\
    \ 1. Internet of things (IoT) for agriculture architecture.\nAn important enabler\
    \ for IoT services in LMICs (and a sub-set of LMICs—global food security\nstrategy\
    \ (GFSS) countries [20]) is reliable cellular infrastructure [21]. Country level\
    \ data from the\nWorld Bank suggests that the GFSS country set average for cellular\
    \ connections and smartphone\npenetration is on par with India, a common benchmark\
    \ for digital services among developing countries\n(Figure 2). However, the linkage\
    \ has not yet been made to the agricultural sector. Internet usage in\nGFSS countries\
    \ ranges from 10%–50% of the population and correlates inversely with the population\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n3 of 19\nemployed in agriculture (Figure 3a). Where\
    \ access to internet falls short, digital services often beneﬁt\nfrom cellular\
    \ connectivity. However, while agricultural productivity has increased in most\
    \ GFSS\ncountries, those gains show no correlation with mobile phone penetration\
    \ (Figure 3b). For example,\na recent study has shown that mobile phone ownership\
    \ in farming households is nearly universal;\nhowever, fewer than 25% use a phone\
    \ to access information about agriculture and livestock, or for\nbuying and selling\
    \ products [22]. These data, and more from the GFSS agriculture dataset, can be\n\
    accessed in the Supplementary Materials.\nFigure 2. Mobile phone subscriptions\
    \ and smartphone penetration across the global food security\nstrategy (GFSS)\
    \ country set, India, China, and the United States [23,24].\nFigure 3. (a) Agriculture\
    \ and internet usage across the GFSS country set, India, China, and the United\n\
    States [23] (b) Crop productivity and mobile connectivity [23]. Crop production\
    \ index (CPI) shows\nagricultural production for each year relative to the base\
    \ period 2004–2006 (CPI = 100). It includes all\ncrops except fodder crops.\n\
    2. Approach\nA mixed method approach consisting of a combination of literature\
    \ reviews, expert interviews,\nweb-based surveys, and site visits were used to\
    \ carry out this research [25–27]. The literature review\nincluded a review of\
    \ 87 relevant publications, which are catalogued in an open online repository\
    \ [25].\nThis review provided an overview of sensors and IoT for agriculture globally.\
    \ Next, 25 interviews with\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n4 of 19\nrelevant experts\
    \ worldwide were conducted. These expert interviews were used to identify the\
    \ gaps\nin understanding the value of the IoT to smallholder farmers and potential\
    \ directions for technology\ndevelopment in this sector. Seventy web-based surveys\
    \ were then distributed to stakeholders in the\nIoT and agricultural technology\
    \ communities from which we received 37 responses; these web-based\nsurveys served\
    \ to not only triangulate the expert interview data, but also to provide use case\
    \ proﬁles\nfor our site visits. Finally, ﬁve site visits and discussions with\
    \ farmers at IoT implementation sites in\nIndia and Kenya were conducted. The\
    \ site visits were used to validate ﬁndings from the literature\nreview, expert\
    \ interviews, and web-based surveys. Two countries were selected for the site\
    \ visits;\n(i) India, which was selected because of the large number of agricultural\
    \ technologies being piloted\nand implemented there on smallholder farms, and\
    \ (ii) Kenya, where we conducted a majority of our\nsite visits. Among the diﬀerent\
    \ GFSS countries, Kenya had the most active IoT for agriculture projects,\nand\
    \ this inﬂuenced our selection.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Current State\
    \ of IoT for Agriculture\nFor this overview of IoT for agriculture, sensor and\
    \ communication technology applications\nare classiﬁed into ﬁve categories of\
    \ (a) climate, (b) livestock, (c) plant, (d) soil, and (e) water.\nWithin each\
    \ category, there are many common, measurable parameters that can inﬂuence the\n\
    performance of the agricultural system (Figure 4). This categorization focuses\
    \ on “ground-based”\nmeasurements, while other methods exist including aerial-\
    \ and space-based earth observation or\nremote sensing, for example in [26,28].\
    \ In some cases, remote sensing and ground-based measurements\nare combined to\
    \ provide temporally (ground-based sensors) and spatially (remote sensing) dense\
    \ crop\nmeasurements [29].\nFigure 4. Measurement categories and related measurable\
    \ parameters.\nTable 1 summarizes common electronic sensors, their applications\
    \ in agriculture, and articles\nthat describe those in more detail. Wherever available,\
    \ articles that report on applications in LMICs\nare included, although relevant\
    \ precision agriculture research from across the globe is also included.\nSome\
    \ parameters can use diﬀerent technologies to estimate the same output. Methods\
    \ for measuring\nbasic agricultural parameters, including soil and atmospheric\
    \ conditions, are well-established,\nand commercial products are available for\
    \ IoT applications. New applications for optical sensors,\nin particular, are\
    \ evolving as the cost of semiconductor technology and data storage and transmission\n\
    decreases. A particular challenge with using low-cost sensors in agriculture is\
    \ the need to calibrate the\nsensor for the speciﬁc implementation conditions.\
    \ For applications where artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is\napplied to classify events\
    \ based on measurement patterns, complex training datasets are necessary to\n\
    teach the AI algorithm.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n5 of 19\nTable 1. Sensor\

    \ careful consideration should be given to the path and\nprocess by which measurements\
    \ are transformed into insights. Data transmission can represent a\nmajor challenge\
    \ in smallholder agriculture applications. Edge computing is becoming more common\n\
    in commercial IoT products, in which onboard device memory and processing capacity\
    \ is utilized to\ncarry out some data reduction and analysis [80]. However, for\
    \ insights that require a large quantity\nof measurements or computational power,\
    \ transmitting data to the cloud for computing will be\nrequired. Table 2 summarizes\
    \ common IoT data transmission protocols and their associated advantages\nand\
    \ disadvantages.\nThe IoT for smallholder agriculture represents a challenge for\
    \ data transmission due to remote\nlocations, with devices distributed over large\
    \ areas or multiple farms that have potentially limited\naccess to electricity\
    \ and cellular networks. Therefore, the range, data rate, and power consumption\
    \ are\nimportant design considerations and are compared for the common communication\
    \ protocols.\nIn Figure 5, communication protocols are grouped based on data rate\
    \ and range of transmission,\nwhich is divided into “Long range”, including low-power\
    \ wide area network (LPWAN), which includes\nLoRa and SigFox, “Short range”, including\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Zigbee, and Z-Wave,\nand cellular communication\
    \ including GSM 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. With respect to power consumption,\nsolutions\
    \ that are tailored to IoT applications oﬀer superior performance to more general\
    \ protocols\n(Figure 6). While the range and power consumption of protocols like\
    \ LoRa and SigFox are well suited\nfor IoT applications, their device compatibility\
    \ is more limited compared to generic wireless protocols\nlike Bluetooth and WiFi.\
    \ Additionally, cellular and satellite communication oﬀer the advantage of\nproviding\
    \ a direct link to a web server instead of passing through an intermediate gateway.\n\

    \ for common communication protocols [81,82]. Bubble size is\nproportional to\
    \ data rate.\nEven though many organizations in LMICs have developed IoT systems\
    \ for agriculture, few studies\nhave reported on the implementation in a smallholder\
    \ context and associated outcomes. Research in\nEmbu County, Kenya tested diﬀerent\
    \ proximal soil sensors to estimate soil properties and composition\non smallholder\
    \ plots and provided management recommendations to farmers [57]. The measurements\n\
    showed considerable variation, both within plots and regionally, indicating a\
    \ need for management\nrecommendations based on both local measurements and regional\
    \ soil maps. Another application\nimplemented a tracing system for smallholders\
    \ who raised live poultry that were traded in Vietnam to\nprevent the spread of\
    \ avian inﬂuenza [75]. Low-cost radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags on\n\
    transport cages and electronic tag readers at markets tracked birds from farm-to-market,\
    \ revealing\nthat birds passed through up to six intermediate traders, creating\
    \ a high risk of virus transmission.\nMany commercial entities serving smallholder\
    \ farmers use the IoT to track assets and interface digitally\nwith customers;\
    \ for example, tractors and implements for hire by Hello Tractor in West Africa\
    \ and\nEM3 AgriServices in India [83], and irrigation equipment by Agriworks,\
    \ Futurepump, and SunCulture\nin East Africa [84]. Enrollment in these services\
    \ is enabling more productive growing; however,\nlow digital literacy is a barrier\
    \ that requires a mix of traditional and technology-enabled engagement\nwith farmers.\
    \ A notable case is the use of sensors to monitor borehole pump reliability for\
    \ potable and\nirrigation water supply in East Africa, which is discussed later\
    \ in this article.\n3.2. Implementation Cases\nIn addition to reviewing the literature\
    \ and interviewing experts, we found it useful to study\non-the-ground implementations\
    \ of the IoT for smallholder agriculture. In particular, this research\naimed\
    \ to understand what helps to create an enabling environment at the country level,\
    \ and the keys to\nsuccess and the risks associated with active IoT in smallholder\
    \ agriculture projects in India and Kenya.\nIndia is home to over 130 million\
    \ smallholder farms [85] and is a common testbed and incubator for\ndigital services\
    \ for farmers. Site visits and discussions in India focused on identifying the\
    \ factors that\nenable innovations in the agricultural sector in order to promote\
    \ those in GFSS countries. The following\nis a summary of those factors.\n• Mobile\
    \ network connectivity and cost: Relatively cheap monthly mobile data plans of\n\
    0.21 USD/GB [38,39] have helped IoT companies explore opportunities to work with\
    \ sensors using\ncellular services for data transmission.\n• Market opportunity:\
    \ The large population size and density, and increasing incomes of the Indian\n\
    middle class, make India a lucrative market for IoT providers [41].\nSustainability\
    \ 2020, 12, 3750\n8 of 19\n• Policies to support farmers: Agriculture accounts\
    \ for 17.32% of India’s GDP and employs over\n50% of the population, and some\
    \ state governments are providing subsidies for new farm equipment\nthat could\
    \ be leveraged towards precision agriculture purchases [40].\n• Academic institutions:\
    \ Some of the highest ranking academic institutions in India are performing\n\
    research that beneﬁts Indian farmers and are raising the awareness of farming\
    \ challenges to students\nthrough hackathons.\nKenya represents a very diﬀerent\
    \ landscape compared to India. The population and total number\nof farm holdings\
    \ are vastly smaller, and many of the enabling factors discussed above are yet\
    \ to emerge.\nHowever, Kenya was selected because, among the diﬀerent GFSS countries,\
    \ the authors’ investigations\nand discussions revealed several active IoT for\
    \ agriculture cases across diﬀerent applications and\nlocations in Kenya. These\
    \ cases are summarized in this section along with some of the keys to the\nsuccess\
    \ and the associated risks with project sustainability.\nAs part of the Kenya\
    \ Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (RAPID) project\n\
    to manage the recently discovered Lodwar Basin Aquifer in northern Kenya, electrical\
    \ current sensors\nwere installed on solar-electric borehole pumps to monitor\
    \ “water system functionality, the approximate\nnumber of pumping hours and volume\
    \ extracted per day, and the last report date for the sensor” [86].\nData from\
    \ the current sensors are transmitted via cellular or satellite network to a web\
    \ server and\ndashboard where county government staﬀ can monitor borehole use.\
    \ While the pumped water serves a\nvariety of community needs, some is used for\
    \ irrigating small farm plots on municipal land that would\notherwise be infertile\
    \ (Figure 7). One of the keys to the success of this IoT implementation was the\
    \ clear\nvalue and utility to the government oﬃcials responsible for the pumps,\
    \ who indicated that access to the\ndashboard signiﬁcantly reduced maintenance\
    \ costs and pump downtime. The Kenya RAPID project\nalso beneﬁts from having a\
    \ large, distributed, and well-coordinated team where each organization\nplays\
    \ a clear role, including the supplier of the IoT technology. The sensor measurements\
    \ have revealed\ndetailed pump usage patterns in relation to rainfall [74], and\
    \ this, coupled with a machine learning\nalgorithm to predict failures and reduce\
    \ detection time, has resulted in an increase in system-wide\npump uptime from\
    \ 70% to > 99% [87]. A risk for the project is the current reliance on grant funding,\n\
    although the IoT component has now been incorporated into the county government\
    \ budget.\nBorehole pump monitoring for small plot community farming in Turkana\n\

    \ that transmits solar irrigation pump\nusage data to an online server via cellular\
    \ or satellite data (right).\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n9 of 19\nThe IoT\
    \ solution for the aquaponics system at Kikaboni Farm was developed by Upande,\
    \ and it\nmonitors water conditions (temperature and pH) in the ﬁsh tanks and\
    \ environmental conditions\n(ambient temperature and relative humidity) in the\
    \ hydroponic vegetable growing area (Figure 8).\nThe sensors are battery-powered,\
    \ charged by 3–10 W solar PV panels, and transmit measurements\nover a LoRa network\
    \ to a gateway with a mobile data connection. Data are stored and processed\n\
    on Upande servers and regularly fed back to the farm’s horticulture manager who\
    \ can perform\nnecessary adjustments. For example, the cover material for the\
    \ vegetable structure was changed after\nmeasurements showed that temperatures\
    \ were far above the recommended growing temperatures for\nleafy green vegetables\
    \ (Figure 8). One of the keys to success for this application is the ability of\
    \ the\nhorticulture manager to interpret the data, which has allowed them to make\
    \ signiﬁcant improvements\nto their product yield and quality. Kikaboni Farm has\
    \ also collaborated on product development by\nproviding a testbed for improvements\
    \ to Upande Vipimo IoT products.\nA risk for this project is the reliance on the\
    \ expertise and willingness of the horticulture manager.\nWater and greenhouse\

    \ at several points along\nthe river, connected by LoRa to several grid-connected\
    \ gateways with cellular access. In the event\nthat the level sensors detect a\
    \ rapid river level rise, an SMS-based system is activated, which alerts\ndownstream\
    \ farmers to pump water out of the river in order to open capacity to receive\
    \ the upstream\nsurge. One of the keys to the success of this system is the dedication\
    \ of volunteers to coordinate\nactivities, maintain the IoT system, and host workshops\
    \ to engage the local communities. Some of\nthe risks to the sustainability of\
    \ this project are a lack of ﬁnancial support, the rugged and remote\nconditions\
    \ that the IoT must survive in, and the inconsistent support from the county government\
    \ to\nallow the system to operate.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n10 of 19\n\
    Flood detection and alert on the Mara River\nFigure 9. The Mara River in the Maasai\
    \ Mara National Reserve (left), and a SONAR level sensor\ninstalled on a bridge\
    \ over the Mara River (right).\nGreenhouses oﬀer the opportunity for small farmers\
    \ to grow high-value vegetables throughout\nthe year in a controlled environment.\
    \ However, uncontrolled greenhouse conditions can be harsh and\ndamaging to plants.\
    \ Researchers at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology developed an IoT\n\
    temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture sensor coupled to an internet-connected\
    \ gateway to\nassist farmers on their research farm (Figure 10) [34]. In this\
    \ case, the system relies on the expertise of\nthe farmers to interpret data and\
    \ make the proper adjustments to the greenhouse. The farmers showed\na high level\
    \ of satisfaction with the system and reported that it had greatly improved productivity\
    \ of\ntomatoes in their greenhouses. A key to the success of this project is the\
    \ close connection and proximity\nbetween the IoT developers and the farmers,\
    \ and the ability of the farmers to interpret the sensor\nmeasurements. This project\
    \ is also equipping engineering students with the skills and experience\nneeded\
    \ to provide commercial IoT for agriculture solutions in Kenya [88]. A potential\
    \ risk to the\nsustainability of this project is that steady funding is needed\
    \ to build a pipeline of work given the\nexpertise, location, and access to research\
    \ agriculture facilities.\nGreenhouse monitoring in Nyeri\nFigure 10. Greenhouse\

    \ available to smallholder farmers, Arable has developed a\nmulti-parameter IoT\
    \ device with a suite of sensors for measurements including ambient temperature,\n\
    humidity, precipitation, Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI), and photosynthetic\
    \ active\nradiation (Figure 11) [22,60]. During current pilots in central Kenya,\
    \ the devices are installed on\nsmallholder farms and data is transmitted through\
    \ cellular network to cloud servers where it is stored\nand analyzed. Reduced\
    \ data is fed back to Kenyan partner researchers and agriculture extension\nagents\
    \ who oﬀer advice to area farmers. Agriculture extension agents reported that\
    \ the local-scale\ninformation is a valuable supplement to regional forecasts\
    \ provided by the Kenyan government and\nhelp them to provide better advice to\
    \ farmers. A risk to this project is the challenge of determining an\neconomical\
    \ pathway to sustain and expand the IoT technology and staﬀ in the ecosystem.\n\

    \ of Challenges and Recommendations\nBased on our literature review, expert interviews,\
    \ surveys, and site visits, the team has synthesized\na list of the challenges\
    \ in IoT for smallholder agriculture in GFSS countries (summarized in Figure 12),\n\
    and proposed recommendations for some of the relevant players involved. The following\
    \ section is\na summary of challenges grouped into ﬁve categories, which correspond\
    \ to the IoT architecture in\nFigure 1: (i) measurement device, (ii) data transmission,\
    \ (iii) data storage and analytics, (iv) feedback\nand implementation, and (v)\
    \ project structure and support. A detailed discussion of the challenges,\nopportunities,\
    \ and recommendations for the IoT for smallholder agriculture can be found in\
    \ the full\nproject report [25]. We believe that this section will be appealing\
    \ to audiences beyond the academic\nand research community, and speciﬁc recommendations\
    \ are segmented towards Technologists, Project\nmanagers, and Funders.\n \nFigure\
    \ 12. Challenges in IoT for smallholder agriculture.\nSustainability 2020, 12,\
    \ 3750\n12 of 19\n3.3.1. Measurement Device Challenges\nAccess to components:\
    \ Oﬀ-the-shelf IoT products are often not available, suitable, or aﬀordable\n\
    for commercial technologies in developing countries. Therefore, custom made solutions\
    \ are designed\nin-house or by local IoT companies. During our site visit in Kenya,\
    \ a number of IoT implementation\nteams that we spoke to indicated that procuring\
    \ electronic and hardware components during the\nproduct development phase often\
    \ delayed the project and increased costs.\nTechnologists: A good starting point\
    \ for prototype circuit components is the local electronics and\nscrap market\
    \ (e.g., CBD in Nairobi, Kisenyi in Kampala, Suame Magazine in Kumasi). These\
    \ markets\nusually stock basic circuit and prototyping components that can be\
    \ used as a “good enough” solution\nto reach a proof-of-concept prototype.\nDevice\
    \ design: Smallholder farms are often in rugged and remote locations and require\
    \ special\nconsideration when designing a connected, electronic device for long-term\
    \ monitoring.\nTechnologists: As soon as possible in the design process, test\
    \ your device at a pilot site that is\nrepresentative of the actual implementation\
    \ site.\nProject managers: Involve the farmers, agriculture extension agents,\
    \ and farmer co-operatives in the\nproduct design phase to help your team identify\
    \ non-obvious challenges and improve the likelihood\nthat farmers will accept\
    \ the idea.\nSensor calibration: Correlating the raw sensor measurements to actual\
    \ physical values requires\nperforming controlled calibration tests that can be\
    \ expensive and time consuming.\nTechnologists: Aim to eventually provide calibration\
    \ documentation for your product so that it can\nbe benchmarked against other\
    \ products and measurement methods. Perform some simple tests to\ncheck factory-calibrated\
    \ sensors in conditions as close to the implementation conditions as possible\
    \ in\ncase there is a need to apply a correction factor.\nAccess to expertise:\n\
    Many teams we visited mentioned a lack of access to expertise and\nresources for\
    \ technical and business challenges. For example, several engineers reported spending\n\
    signiﬁcant amounts of time combing through websites to ﬁnd technical solutions\
    \ during their\nproduct development.\nTechnologists: Participate in online communities\
    \ focused on IoT for agriculture hardware, especially\nfor idea exchange, technical\
    \ support, and recruiting. For example, we found the Gathering of Open Ag\nTech\
    \ to be a good example of such a resource in the agriculture sector (forum.goatech.org).\n\
    3.3.2. Data Transmission Challenges:\nPoor connectivity: Due to the remote location\
    \ of some farming communities, poor mobile network\nconnectivity and reliability\
    \ is a common challenge.\nTechnologists: As a last resort, data can be collected\
    \ manually, i.e., from a central hub connected to\nindividual devices by a local\
    \ wireless network.\nProject managers: Check mobile network coverage in your implementation\
    \ area using GSMA maps\nand cross-check with non-industry sources, for example,\
    \ a compilation of user contributed Nperf data.\nTransmission cost: While data\
    \ costs have decreased signiﬁcantly, the recurring cost of providing\nIoT services\
    \ was frequently identiﬁed as a challenge for commercial applications.\nTechnologists:\
    \ For some applications, satellite and LPWAN-based service providers are increasingly\n\
    cost-competitive with conventional mobile data.\n3.3.3. Data Storage and Analytics\n\
    Measurement to feedback: Raw sensor measurements can be diﬃcult to reduce into\
    \ actionable\nrecommendations for farmers.\nProject managers: While measurements\
    \ are relatively easy to display on a dashboard, correlating\nthem with crop growth\
    \ and other eﬀects requires input from a topical expert. Accessing the right\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n13 of 19\nexpertise can be a challenge in itself,\
    \ but resources at universities and agricultural extension agencies\ncan often\
    \ give some direction.\nTechnologists: Take a human centered approach by having\
    \ farmers and agriculture experts from\nthe area provide input on (a) what kind\
    \ of recommendations would be useful and actionable and (b)\nthe best means for\
    \ the farmer to receive the recommendation.\nEquity of access: The ownership of\
    \ data collected is often overlooked in IoT projects and can lead\nto disagreements\
    \ among stakeholders.\nProject managers: Negotiate data access with project partners\
    \ and funders. While it is important\nto maintain community access to data, service\
    \ providers and funders may have requirements for\ndata access.\nFunders: Communicate\
    \ early with the project implementers and have clear guidelines on data\naccess,\
    \ privacy, ownership, and sharing mechanisms of the data with the community.\n\
    3.3.4. Feedback and Implementation\nSmartphone penetration: Many agriculture advisory\
    \ mobile apps are designed for use on\na smartphones; however, smartphone penetration\
    \ is low among rural populations in GFSS\ncountries [89,90].\nProject managers:\
    \ Make sure the output is reaching the intended audience in a format that is\n\
    accessible to them. If smartphone penetration is low, then using another medium\
    \ such as radio,\ntelevision, local print media, or extension agents can be appropriate\
    \ to provide recommendations\nto farming communities [17]. Early discussions with\
    \ farmers, farmer co-operatives, and agriculture\nextension agents could help\
    \ to make sure that the output is reaching the audience through the right\ncommunication\
    \ channel.\nRemote location: Many smallholder farms are in remote, diﬃcult-to-access\
    \ locations, which can\nadd signiﬁcant cost to IoT services if technicians need\
    \ to regularly visit farms.\nTechnologists: Incorporate onboard diagnostics for\
    \ your device (e.g., battery voltage, microcontroller\ntemperature, accelerometer)\
    \ in order to minimize maintenance visits.\nProject managers: Identify a local\
    \ farmer or extension agent who can assist with basic sensor\nmaintenance and\
    \ troubleshooting, for example, the horticulture manager at Kikaboni Farm described\n\
    in Section 3.2.\nIoT revenue generation: Identifying the best customer for the\
    \ information collected is important.\nIn many cases, there is an opportunity\
    \ to provide a service along with the hardware, which can provide\nrecurring revenue.\n\
    Project managers: Many IoT for agriculture projects are initially grant funded,\
    \ and determining\napproaches to monetize data and analytics services will help\
    \ ensure project sustainability. Consider\nthis aspect when agreeing on the terms\
    \ of the funding.\n3.3.5. Project Structure and Support\nComplicated ecosystem:\n\
    Successfully implementing an agriculture-IoT project involves\ncoordination of\
    \ a large, and sometimes complicated, ecosystem of actors over a long timescale.\n\
    Project managers: Try to organize a team of collaborators that includes data scientists,\
    \ sensor\nexperts, and agriculture experts so that each is contributing to solving\
    \ a speciﬁc part of the problem in\nwhich he/she is an expert.\nIoT business model:\
    \ Most people we connected with during this project agreed that data from\non-farm\
    \ sensors is valuable. However, identifying a speciﬁc customer, or buyer, of the\
    \ device or\nservice is less straightforward, especially when the beneﬁciary is\
    \ unlikely to have the means to aﬀord\nthe technology.\nProject managers: Identifying\
    \ and understanding whom the end customer is and who will be\npaying for the data\
    \ is important. A good example is the Kenya RAPID project, described in Section\
    \ 3.2,\nin which the county government includes the IoT services in their annual\
    \ budget.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n14 of 19\nShort funding timelines: Two-\
    \ and three-year grants from donor agencies are short timelines;\nwhen it comes\
    \ to farming seasons, this is a relatively short time period because you get data\
    \ from\nonly one or two cropping cycles, so collecting quality data and making\
    \ actionable recommendations is\na challenge.\nFunders: Increase funding timelines\
    \ to ﬁve to seven years to allow for data collection over multiple\ncropping periods.\
    \ A larger dataset also enables better pattern recognition and predictive analytics,\n\
    leading to suitable actionable recommendations.\nVertical integration: Many organizations\
    \ are providing an end-to-end solution in which a\nsingle organization takes on\
    \ the responsibility of farmer recruitment, IoT technology development,\nimplementation,\
    \ data analysis and recommendations, and monitoring and evaluation.\nProject managers:\
    \ Some of the key stakeholders the team spoke with indicated that, while they\n\
    were experts in a few aspects of the IoT and agriculture, trying to work on the\
    \ entire end-to-end process\nof an agriculture IoT ecosystem was stretching them\
    \ thin; thus, incorporating a horizontal structure in\nwhich each organization\
    \ oﬀers speciﬁc expertise to solve the overall problem in a piecemeal fashion\
    \ is\nfavorable for project success.\nFunders: Funding agencies can play a facilitation\
    \ role to connect diverse groups with speciﬁc\nexpertise to solve the overall\
    \ problem. Organizations forming new partnerships could particularly\nbeneﬁt from\
    \ guidance in negotiating agreements and contracts.\n4. Conclusions\nThis review\
    \ presents a perspective of the current state of the IoT in smallholder agriculture,\n\
    including summaries of state-of-the-art sensor and communication technologies\
    \ and real examples of\nIoT implementation on farms in Kenya, and the challenges\
    \ and recommendations associated with the\nimplementation of IoT on smallholder\
    \ farms in LMICs. The barriers and challenges are largely known\nand surmountable,\
    \ and viable implementation of the IoT is already occurring. Currently, applications\
    \ for\nscenarios with easily detectable and actionable parameters offer more immediate\
    \ promise and likelihood\nof uptake than those implementing measurements that\
    \ are more difficult to interpret. Additionally,\ntargeting measurements that\
    \ address a significant pain point (e.g., water supply reliability) can ensure\n\
    buy-in from and value to the communities involved. Major evolving challenges due\
    \ to climate change\nwill motivate implementation of the IoT to improve resilience\
    \ and secure safety nets for global food\nsupply. Greater resilience and agricultural\
    \ productivity have the potential to strengthen rural economies\nand help developing\
    \ countries along their journey to self-reliance. The IoT for agriculture objective\n\
    remains: To gather sufficient quantities of data of the right type, from the right\
    \ location, at a low cost,\nand with sufficiently well-informed analysis and understanding\
    \ for farmers to take action.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available\

    \ agriculture employs cutting-edge technologies to increase agricultural productiv-\n\
    ity while reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Precision agriculture is\
    \ a farming approach\nthat uses advanced technology and data analysis to maximize\
    \ crop yields, cut waste, and increase\nproductivity. It is a potential strategy\
    \ for tackling some of the major issues confronting contemporary\nagriculture,\
    \ such as feeding a growing world population while reducing environmental effects.\
    \ This\nreview article examines some of the latest recent advances in precision\
    \ agriculture, including the\nInternet of Things (IoT) and how to make use of\
    \ big data. This review article aims to provide an\noverview of the recent innovations,\
    \ challenges, and future prospects of precision agriculture and\nsmart farming.\
    \ It presents an analysis of the current state of precision agriculture, including\
    \ the most\nrecent innovations in technology, such as drones, sensors, and machine\
    \ learning. The article also\ndiscusses some of the main challenges faced by precision\
    \ agriculture, including data management,\ntechnology adoption, and cost-effectiveness.\n\

    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n2 of 26\n\
    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\

    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\

    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\
    \ where such data are able to be used for site-\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n\
    5 of 26\nspeciﬁc management to optimize management practices precisely [7]. For\
    \ small-scale\nvariabilities of soil and crop features, a local resource management\
    \ (LRM) system was\ndeveloped with computer-aided farming (CAF), which translated\
    \ information into variable\nrate applications [11].\nThus far, humans have used\
    \ digital tools to enhance diagnosis and decision making\nwhile adding automated\
    \ machines for precise performing [14]. The accelerating changes of\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 plus these digital technologies have granted the gradual automation of the\n\
    diagnosis and decision-making steps, limiting human involvement to only monitoring\n\
    (Figure 1) [6]. This revolution mostly targets optimal farming and variability\

    \ should not rely solely\non “more production”. At the same time, it should be\

    \ [5]. Gen-\nerally, unstructured and vast amounts of data are used by big business\
    \ industries, like\nsocial-networking sites, to learn or predict customer behaviors\
    \ accurately [4]. Similarly,\nin precision agriculture, big data analytics are\
    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\
    \ GIS. These conjugations can discover correlations, patterns, and\ntrends from\
    \ large quantities of data via capturing, storing, exchanging, analyzing, and\n\
    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\
    \ high levels\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n8 of 26\nof manual labor input, performing\

    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\
    \ mobile terminals, and intelligent devices in\nmodern agriculture, the integration\
    \ of machine-learning algorithms has had signiﬁcant\nimprovement. With machine-learning\
    \ models, integration into mobile detection algorithms\nhas paved the way for\
    \ innovative and more precise detection methods, overcoming certain\nlimitations\
    \ faced by technology adaptation in plant factories, such as limited computer\n\

    \ and\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n10 of 26\nprecision issues related to small\
    \ target detection [25,43]. Furthermore, machine-learning\ntechniques can mitigate\
    \ the need for large network sizes and improve the operational\nspeeds of these\

    \ fruit and pest detection, as well as the optimization and prediction of complex\n\

    \ learning, and deep learning holds great potential in\novercoming these roadblocks\
    \ and providing accurate predictions of the dynamic nature\nof agriculture while\
    \ identifying new opportunities [1]. Supervised machine-learning\ntechniques,\
    \ such as support vector machines, decision trees, k-means, random forests,\n\
    genetic algorithms, deep learning, and fuzzy logic, are several categories of\
    \ machine-\nlearning models (Figure 3) that play a vital role in agricultural\
    \ automation, augmenting\nthe intelligence of other technologies, such as smartphones,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles,\nunmanned ground vehicles, satellite systems, automated\
    \ machines, agricultural robots,\nand big data analytics [1,28,31].\nMobile applications\
    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\
    \ learning\n(DL), the initial stage of adopting ML models in precision agriculture\
    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that enable the nondestruc-\ntive estimation\
    \ of plant traits, such as yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index. This is\

    \ The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops \nwith high yield and strong\
    \ stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately \nleading\
    \ to improved production [60]. \nAs technology advances, the future of high-throughput\

    \ [61]. The transformative\npotential of 5G and beyond mobile networks in driving\
    \ business and societal change is\nbeing recognized. Considering environmental\
    \ concerns and climate change, the role of\nmobile networks in fostering sustainability\
    \ and innovation is questioned. Sectors like smart\nagriculture, forestry, biodiversity\
    \ monitoring, and water management are crucial for sus-\ntainable resource utilization.\
    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\
    \ domains [34]. As an example, a study in Thailand designed telematics-equipped\n\
    tractors to assist farmers in efﬁciently managing their machinery, optimizing\
    \ performance\nand enhancing overall productivity. In addition to improved management\
    \ capabilities,\nthese tractors offered features such as theft prevention, effective\
    \ maintenance monitoring,\nand machine operation tracking [62].\n4. Studies of\
    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\
    \ thinning and pruning. This system addressed\nlabor shortages, reduced fruit\
    \ production costs by approximately 30%, provided real-time\nupdates to farmers\
    \ via a mobile app, and aimed to tackle challenges faced by the agriculture\n\
    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\
    \ in\nthe cloud, reducing costs and improving productivity. Experimental validation\
    \ conﬁrmed\nthe effectiveness of the model for crop prediction and soil health\
    \ maintenance, emphasizing\nthe importance of real-time data collection and expanding\
    \ data sets and regular application\nuse for informed decision making and soil\
    \ quality enhancement [49]. The use of unmanned\naerial systems (UASs) and unmanned\
    \ ground vehicles (UGVs) in precision agriculture for\ninspecting insect traps\
    \ in olive groves was proposed by [49], with a cooperative robot archi-\ntecture\
    \ using UAS and UGV systems evaluating vision-based navigation algorithms and\n\
    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\
    \ capture. Future work\nincludes real-world scenarios and long-term mission capabilities\
    \ of UAS vehicles [49].\nTwo studies from University Tenaga National, Malaysia,\
    \ present autonomous and\nrobotic machineries to deal with fertilizer and pesticide\
    \ spraying. The authors of [67]\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n16 of 26\npresented\
    \ a low-cost agricultural robot for fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,\n\
    and pest detection. The prototype system operated autonomously, reducing labor\
    \ costs,\nalthough productivity slightly lagged behind human workers. An autonomous\
    \ organic\nfertilizer mixer was developed in [68] based on IoT technology to reduce\
    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\
    \ vehicle, a visual servo unit, a manipulator,\nand picking end-effectors. Field\
    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\
    \ Autonomous Insects Trap Monitoring\nSystem experiment in Portugal proposed a\
    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\
    \ an olive inspection scenario [49]. Russian researchers Filipe et al. [7]\nproposed\
    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\
    \ agriculture tasks,\nensuring transparency and veriﬁcation at each stage. Precision\
    \ agriculture is a strategy that\nuses advanced technologies, like sensors, remote\
    \ sensing, and data analytics, to improve\nagricultural management decisions and\
    \ increase productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainabil-\nity. Machine-learning\
    \ models have been integrated with IoT sensors to develop intelligent\nsensors\
    \ for generating of big amount of data. In the study of Smolka et al. [71], a\
    \ microchip\ncapillary electrophoresis sensor was used for soil nutrient analysis,\
    \ demonstrating its gen-\neral sensitivity to ions in liquids, particularly NO3,\
    \ NH4, K, and PO4. The sensor exhibited\nstrong linearity and detected important\
    \ plant nutrients, which could contribute to future\ndevelopments in digital agriculture.\
    \ Insufﬁcient power infrastructure is one obstacle in\nadapting novel technologies\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds. Researchers successfully developed an\nIoT-based solar-energy-powered\
    \ smart farm irrigation system in the United Arab Emirates\nthat harvested renewable\
    \ energy for smart farm irrigation [72]. This study outcome paved\nthe way to\
    \ developing three operation modes that are available for farmers’ use.\nVRT is\
    \ a major constituent in precision agriculture that deploys ﬁeld maps, GPSs, and\n\
    GNSSs to establish the precision of input applications. A study of a data fusion\
    \ method\nfor yield and soil sensor maps [21] evaluated fusion results on ﬁelds,\
    \ highlighting their\nusefulness in decision support for drainage, irrigation,\
    \ and variable yield goals. It un-\ncovered hidden areas of lost yield potential\
    \ using soil sensing, EC, pH, organic matter,\nand topography data fusion. Researchers\
    \ in Beijing, China, developed a new method\nusing image segmentation and pixel-level\
    \ visual features to accurately classify ﬁeld and\nroad areas in GNSS recordings\
    \ of agricultural machinery, surpassing existing methods\nand demonstrating a\
    \ superior performance for high-frequency GNSS trajectories [46]. A\nmultisensor\
    \ data fusion approach was used by Whattoff et al. for creating variable depth\n\
    tillage zones [27]. Variable depth tillage (VDT) reduced costs, labor, and fuel\
    \ consumption.\nA multisensor data fusion approach was developed to map soil properties\
    \ for VDT imple-\nmentation, showing the depth of tillage needed in different\
    \ areas. This approach proved\nuseful in guiding VDT operations for efﬁcient soil\
    \ management.\nOne study in Germany integrated computer-aided farming, an IoT-based\
    \ pH sensor,\nand VRT for effective VR liming, and the lime requirement was successfully\
    \ determined\nin situ by establishing a buffer curve [11]. A ﬁeld evaluation of\
    \ a VR aerial application\nwas conducted in the study of Martin and Yang [23]\
    \ utilizing prescription maps for aerial\nglyphosate applications with variable\
    \ rate nozzles. Accurate spray deposition within 20 feet\nAgriculture 2023, 13,\
    \ 1593\n17 of 26\nof the target was conﬁrmed using multispectral imagery, boosting\
    \ conﬁdence in variable\nrate application and encouraging adoption. Italian authors\
    \ Corbari et al. [73] explored the\nintegration of a satellite-driven soil–water\
    \ balance model and meteorological forecasts to\nenable precision smart irrigation.\
    \ It discussed model performance and emphasized the\nimportance of using consistent\
    \ data for the calibration and validation of soil hydrological\nparameters [73].\
    \ The short communication of Jang et al. [22], “Spatial Dependence Analysis\n\
    as a Tool to Detect the Hidden Heterogeneity in a Kenaf Field”, presented high-throughput\n\
    phenotyping as having potential in precision agriculture. This study demonstrated\
    \ its\napplication for revealing ﬁeld heterogeneity and suggested its use for\
    \ better analysis and\nmanagement in plant breeding and precision agriculture.\
    \ In [57], Kim et al. emphasized\nthe importance of evaluating drought effects\
    \ during the vegetative stages of soybean,\nindicating the potential of using\
    \ phenotypic traits as selection indicators for breeding\ndrought-resistant soybean\
    \ cultivars, especially considering the escalating crop damage\ncaused by drought\
    \ and global warming.\nAnother study asserted precision agricultural applications\
    \ in agroforestry. Tree species\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation is important\
    \ when combatting climate change, as well as\nmonitoring ecosystem health 17.\
    \ Researchers used images from SENTINEL-2 to propose\nmethods to determine tree\
    \ type distribution in a wide forest area using UAV images [14,17].\nThey effectively\
    \ distinguished evergreen, deciduous trees, and grassland areas, aiding in\nforest\
    \ planning and preparing for climate change impacts. Ma et al. [14] used a random\n\
    forest classiﬁer with satellite images to improve texture feature separation among\
    \ tree\nspecies. The overall classiﬁcation achieved 86.49% accuracy and a 0.83\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient,\nalthough altitude, slope, and aspect inﬂuenced tree distribution.\
    \ These outcomes were\nimportant in species classiﬁcation and biodiversity monitoring,\
    \ as well as in informing\ninventory estimation [14].\nAn evaluation of soybean\
    \ wildﬁre prediction via hyperspectral transmission imag-\ning was performed with\
    \ Python, which detected bacterial wildﬁre in soybean leaves\nwhere different\
    \ varieties exhibited distinct spectral signatures. This allowed the precise\n\
    detection and differentiation of healthy and diseased plants effectively with\
    \ high accu-\nracy (97.19% and 95.69%) in early disease detection, conﬁrming its\
    \ usefulness in soybean\nplant monitoring [32].\nAasim et al. [44] focused on\
    \ establishing the efﬁcient and reproducible in vitro re-\ngeneration of common\
    \ beans through a combined approach of in vitro regeneration and\nmachine-learning\
    \ algorithms. ML models, particularly ANN algorithms, were used for\nprediction\
    \ and optimization. The ML and ANN models demonstrated superior perfor-\nmances,\
    \ proving their efﬁcacy in analyzing and optimizing complex conditions in plant\n\
    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\
    \ computer vision, DL, the IoT and a smartphone.\nThe proposed CVDL-WDC technique\
    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy, achieving an impressive accu-\nracy of 93.23%, a sensitivity\
    \ of 91.43%, a speciﬁcity of 91.56%, a precision of 92.23%,\na recall of 90.36%,\
    \ and an F-score of 91.28% with a data set of 500. The ﬂood detec-\ntion system\
    \ outperformed existing methods and holds potential for further enhancement\n\
    through the integration of IoT devices and advanced algorithms, ensuring improved\
    \ ﬂood\ndetection capabilities.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n18 of 26\nIn order\
    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\
    \ (WG),\nand rice protein (RP). Increasing the proportion of rice protein improved\
    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\
    \ inﬂuenced\ntechnology adoption, with younger farmers having larger farms being\
    \ more inclined to\nadopt technology, resulting in decreased labor and fertilizer\
    \ expenses, which emphasized\nthe importance of providing continuous training\
    \ and promoting extension services for\nsustainable adoption [76].\nTable 2. Studies\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n22 of 26\n6. Future Developments Required\nIn recent\
    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\
    \ smart farming.\nArmed with this knowledge, companies can make informed decisions\
    \ regarding technology\ninvestments and strategic planning while promoting sustainable\
    \ farming practices and\ncollaboration within the industry. By embracing Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, farmers and\ncompanies can enhance their agricultural operations,\
    \ optimize resource utilization, and\ncontribute to the collective progress toward\
    \ smart farming’s promising future.\nAuthor Contributions: E.M.B.M.K., A.T.L.,\

    used in Agriculture 4.0. • Distributed Architectures and Cloud Computing complements.
    • Strategies of association between Edge, Fog, Cloud. • New architectural and
    computing trends. Abstract The Agriculture 4.0, also called Smart Agriculture
    or Smart Farming, is at the origin of the production of a huge amount of data
    that must be collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing
    this massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use adapted
    IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of Central Cloud,
    Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing Strategies, and new trends
    used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In this review, we try to answer 4 research
    questions: (1) Which storage and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture
    4.0 applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic architectures
    meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal
    development possibilities that allow the transition from research to industrialization?
    (4) What are the vertical valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained
    in the cloud to embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare architectures
    with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability, high throughput,
    Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness, Maintainability), and analyze the
    advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    the Internet of Things (IoT), also formerly named pervasive Internet, is present
    in all domains of our daily life and follows exponential growth. The number of
    connected devices is estimated at the horizon of 2022 at 42.5 billion and at the
    horizon of 2025 at 75.5 billion1. The global IP traffic is estimated to 333 ZB
    per month in 20222 with the need to store and treat this data (Carnevale et al.,
    2019). The European Commission has predicted that 18 billion of 29 billion connected
    devices will be related to the IoT in 2022 (Agency, 2020). Cisco in a white paper
    has announced that connected devices to the Internet will generate 850 ZB/year
    by 2021 (Cisco, 2018). It is difficult to precisely determine the number of connected
    devices on a world scale, but their number is about several billion. In addition,
    McKinsey Global Institute predicts a total economic impact of IoT and Edge Computing
    devices that will reach 11 trillion USD by 2025 (Manyika and Chui, 2015). In the
    sector of the agriculture, nearly 12 million agricultural sensors installed globally
    by 2023 with an increase of 20% annually, which is predicted by the Business Insider
    Intelligence Service (Meola, 2021). Moreover, the smart agriculture business was
    estimated at USD 13.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 22 billion
    by 2025 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.8% (Meola, 2021). Within
    the IoT era, the type of clients is becoming increasingly lightweight. IoT devices
    and the network environment is gradually changing from high-speed wired networks
    to unstable wireless communication. Meanwhile, users'' demand IoT applications
    is also shifting to real-time and context-aware service provisioning, making the
    focus moving progressively from the cloud to the edge (Ren et al., 2017). The
    cloud is located within the Internet and is geographically centralized, is constituted
    of a few resourceful server nodes, and is inserted in multi hops in terms of distance
    among the clients (Munir et al., 2017). Cloud Computing (CC) is a paradigm widely
    available that offers benefits like minimal management effort, convenience, rapid
    elasticity, pay per use, ubiquity (Ai et al., 2018), easy maintenance, centralized
    management, and high server utilization (Shi et al., 2016). Furthermore, resources
    centralization implies an increase of average network latency, heavy bandwidth
    utilization, and high processing delay. Indeed, the tremendous amount of data
    handled in a unique server point can create congestion in the cloud servers and
    backhaul links (El-Sayed et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the rapid parallel development
    of the pervasive intelligent device, ubiquitous network, growth in popularity
    of virtual and augmented reality, self-driving vehicles, UAVs, social networks,
    networks applications, and services are not without consequences. As a matter
    of fact, the network bandwidth and speed limit performance and effectiveness of
    cloud computing especially for real-time and mission-critical applications cannot
    be guaranteed. Moreover, cloud computing can be hardly adapted or applied to various
    types of technologies and applications scenarios (Zhou et al., 2017). To address
    these issues, various extensions of central cloud computing have been proposed
    by industrial and academics to move computing and storage at the edge of the network
    close to users. Fog computing uses network elements between the central cloud
    and the edge of network and absolute edge elements such as microcontrollers close
    to sensors to process and store data with a distributed manner close to nodes.
    Whereas, with the developments of mobile devices, some new paradigms close to
    mobiles users have been proposed. For example, cloudlets or micro data centers
    are geographically implanted and accessible by means of Wi-Fi protocols; but,
    this approach does not always guarantee enough network quality. Manufacturers
    of cellular network equipment have proposed the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm
    that associates fog servers with base stations to provide services to mobile devices.
    MEC associated with 5G allows to combine an ultra-low latency network with high
    available bandwidth, and processing resources accessible in the vicinity. The
    MEC original concept has been extended then to wireless networks and consequently
    renamed in “Multi-access Edge Computing” (Wang et al., 2020). Agriculture has
    previously undergone two waves of revolution. The first one was mechanization
    and the second was called the green revolution with genetic modifications (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). Since the late 1990s, the digital transformation of the
    agriculture in Agriculture 3.0 also called Precision Agriculture has begun with
    the integration of Geographical Information System (GIS), Global Positioning Systems
    (GPS), and the usage of sensors have invaded agriculture. They allowed the emergency
    of image processing, techniques using deep learning, and machine learning in the
    field of computer vision. This latter is implemented to discriminate weed, identify
    crops, detect diseases,…etc. The production of a large amount of data by agriculture
    3.0 has required the development of big data technologies to process them, reflecting
    important changes in various fields of research. Collected data must be recorded
    in a specific format in order to discover patterns, curate errors, eliminate duplicated
    or inconsistent data, or solve noise problems (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Smart
    Farming also called Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is a domain of IoT in
    full growth which bring innovative paths to improve the adaptability, the efficiency,
    and the resilience of the agriculture of production systems (Iaksch et al., 2021)
    boost competitiveness and profit (Triantafyllou et al., 2019), allocate resources
    reasonably, and avoid food waste (Zhai et al., 2020, Wolfert et al., 2017) thanks
    to the contribution of autonomous context awareness provided by sensors and the
    capability to execute autonomous or remote actions (Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart
    Farming displaces the strict application from the farm location to affect related
    fields such as decision making by farmers, biodiversity, supply chains management,
    food availability and quality, insurance, and research in environment and earth
    sciences,… Smart Farming is distinct from other domains of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) by the observation and action of biological objects (animals or plants).
    It differs from medical IoT by the fact that there are no issues related to privacy;
    but, the confidentiality of data is related to production processes. Like most
    areas of the IoT, Wireless Sensing and Actuating Network (WSAN) use Low-power
    and Lossy Network organized in hierarchical routing to collect data and actuate
    devices. Multi-path routing protocols can also be implemented to balance the data
    transfer load and conserve the energy of limited battery life, basic computational
    skills, unique communication identifier, and resources-constrained nodes. Due
    to the limited battery life, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to recharge
    or replace (Debauche et al., 2021). Moreover, energy-saving and ambient energy
    techniques must be applied to deal with the active and inactive operational time
    and schedule information transmission (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). To which objects
    can be added like connected agricultural vehicles, milking robots, Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) commonly known as drones, Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) also called
    robots, mobile devices such as tablets used to encode punctual observations (Debauche
    et al., 2021), and external sources such as public geo-services (Triantafyllou
    et al., 2019). The use of IoT in agriculture 4.0 ranges from family farming as
    for example in India on a very small scale with a few low-cost sensors and actuators
    to very large scales with thousands of expensive commercial sensors and many connected
    agricultural pieces of machineries as in the American mid-west. Smart Farming
    is characterized as aforementioned by a wide variety of objects that can produce
    the highly contrasted amounts of data from few bytes/s to Gb/s. In addition, the
    availability of network protocols in rural areas to transmit this data impact
    also the type of architecture to implement. Applications need treatments in real-time
    and/or at a different time. The ”real-time” requirements are also very variable
    depending on the use case. For instance, remote control of drones requires reaction
    times of at most a few milliseconds while the Variable Rate Fertilizer (VRF) or
    Variable Spraying (VS) application aim to optimize nutrients and herbicides application
    respectively need reaction time in a range of few milliseconds to few seconds.
    The real-time processing for monitoring a herd of cattle is of the order of a
    few minutes to a few hours. The data retention time is very variable and is highly
    dependent on each use case. For example, UAVs produce tremendous quantities of
    images to transfer to the cloud in real-time where they must be quickly processed
    and stored. They can also be post-processed to extract additional data in batch
    processing. While UGVs images lose their value after processing and eventually
    actuating. However, if data is of a special, new or exceptional nature, it can
    be stored with a view, for example, to improving artificial intelligence algorithms.
    Other sensors transmit data only when anomalies are detected while others transmit
    at regular intervals a tiny amount of data. However, the adoption of Smart Farming
    is hampered by the lack of models to guide stakeholders on how to implement and
    to deploy dense and heterogeneous IoT-based monitoring systems and manage their
    interoperability (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Commercial sensors are very expensive
    making it impossible for small farms to implement them (Garcia et al., 2020).
    In addition, two trends are currently opposed. That coming from the manufacturers
    of agricultural machinery who have developed their ecosystems and who want to
    extend the services offered to farmers by attracting them into the captive ecosystems
    in which they are locked. Furthermore, another trend is the development of open
    ecosystems in which farmers can preserve the ownership of their data and keep
    control of the processing carried out on this data and of their use. On one hand,
    farmers are therefore faced with a dilemma where they are in any case forced to
    use agricultural equipment that collects their data against their will; on the
    other hand, they want to keep control of their data collected through IoT sensors.
    Currently, it is difficult to predict which of these two trends will take precedence
    over the other or whether one of the two will coexist (Wolfert et al., 2017).
    In this context, both private and public researchers can either use generic commercial
    platforms offered by cloud players on which they have limited possibilities of
    adaptation or develop their own architecture on the basis of commercial or free
    bricks, but with much greater possibilities of adaptation. In this case, the choice
    is also delicate, and a bad evaluation of the constraints can jeopardize the research
    project. Due to the recent advances in big data, we present a survey that provides
    an overview of the state of the art regarding Smart Farming. It aims at summarizing
    parameters that condition the choice of architecture to collect, process, and
    store agricultural data. Since there is a wide variety of use cases, it is important
    to make an informed choice when it comes to architecture. In this way, we address
    the current gap in the literature with a review of cloud architecture used in
    Agriculture 4.0 to collect, process, and store data to enlighten the reader about
    the possible choices and the new trends that emerge. The rest of this paper is
    structured as follows: The second section is composed of two parts. In the first
    part, we summarize related previous review in the domain and their contributions,
    in order to contextualize our contribution to the literature. In the second part,
    we identify architectures implemented in Agriculture 4.0 use cases. In the third
    section, we describe the methodology used to identify papers, the conceptual framework
    used to analyze the literature, and the criteria used to compare the selected
    architectures. In the fourth section, we present architectures used to collect,
    process, and store data. We describe successively the cloud-centric architectures,
    the extension of cloud paradigm, the distributed architecture. In the fifth section,
    new trends and futures directions are presented. In the sixth section, we discuss
    the future evolution of Agriculture 4.0 to Agriculture 5.0. Finally, the last
    section concludes this paper with recommendations and perspectives. 2. Related
    works We begin our review by identifying the previous review realized in the field
    of Internet of Things applied to Smart Agriculture to take stock of the state
    of art and highlighting aspects that have not been explored at the present time.
    In this section, we focus to achieve two objectives. The first aims to position
    our work in relation to the existing literature. The second aims to identify architectures
    commonly used in the case of applications in Agriculture 4.0. 2.1. Previous reviews

    2021) In the following paragraphs, we will draw a panoramic summary of the existing
    reviews during the past four years (2017–2021). In 2017, Ray (Ray, 2017) reviewed
    throughout his paper IoT applications and the challenges that have been faced
    while IoT deployment to improve farming. Talavera. et al. (Talavera et al., 2017)
    reviewed agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) for monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Tzounis et
    al. conducted a survey of IoT technologies in agriculture and the challenges that
    farmers face going forward (Tzounis et al., 2017). Elijah et al. identified the
    most encountered challenges in the field of IoT applications in smart agriculture
    and presented common trends for innovative ideas (Elijah et al., 2018). In 2019,
    Ayaz et al. provided a state-of-art about IoT-based architectures applied in agriculture
    and identified present and future trends in the same field of study (Ayaz et al.,
    2019). Farooq et al. presented the ingredients of IoT-based smart farming with
    used technologies that apply the utilization of network architecture and protocols;
    in addition to that, they provided an overview of the regulations and policies
    of the use of IoT in farming regarding security and privacy. They concluded their
    study by summarizing the main challenges encountered in this discipline (Farooq
    et al., 2019). Feng et al. provided an overview of the wireless communication
    technologies in the precision agriculture domain. They benchmarked the prospection
    and challenges of existing technologies with the regular communication time used
    (Feng et al., 2019). Shafi et al. conducted a literature review about IoT-based
    automation of agriculture along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). These authors
    presented a case study based upon two models: 1- a WSN to monitor real-time crop
    of health conditions, 2- system-base remote sensing imagery to classification
    between healthy and unhealthy yield (Shafi et al., 2019). In terms of agriculture
    protection, Shi et al. drew a panoramic review during the last decade to address
    the challenge and future works to further the research in the field of protected
    agriculture (Shi et al., 2019). Khanna et Kaur called into an evolutionary scenario
    to highlight the most significant impact of IoT in Precision Agriculture (PA).
    They evaluated the contribution of their predecessors and enhanced the challenges
    to open up a new direction of inspiration and innovation in IoT applied to PA
    (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). Ruan et al. reviewed literature works from 2009 to 2018
    to suggest new ideas for folks interested to conduct research in the field of
    agriculture IoT, infrastructures, data security, and data sharing (Ruan et al.,
    2019). In 2020, two studies have been carried out about 20 UAV applications that
    are devoted to either aerial crop monitoring processes or spraying tasks (Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al., 2020) and about the dilemmas that researchers must overcome while deploying
    IoT in the green agriculture domain (Ferrag et al., 2020). Villa-Henriksen et
    al. identified different challenges encountered during the implementation of IoT
    in various applications and proposed different solutions to address them (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Misra et al. discuss the role of IoT and big data analysis in Smart
    Farming (Misra et al., 2020). In 2021, a recent study conducted by Friha et al.
    hypothesize the use, application, classification, and comparison of the most developed
    emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV), Wireless Technologies, open-source IoT platforms, Software Defined Networking
    (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, cloud/fog computing,
    and middleware platforms (Friha et al., 2021). In the same year, Debauche et al.
    conducted a literature review to describe the main components of IoT and its applications
    in the field of Smart Farming (Debauche et al., 2021). 2.2. Platforms implemented
    in use cases We grouped applications into 4 categories: (1) Water Management in
    which we have aggregate all types of water use such as irrigation and watering
    animals. (2) Plant Disease and Pest groups all use cases in plant’s pathologies
    detection and treatment of plant pathologies (spraying of fungicides, pesticides,
    etc). (3) Crop Management brings together all the use cases relating to cropping
    operations: soil management (plowing, fertilizer application), sowing, weeding,
    and harvesting. (4) Livestock includes everything related to the breeding of farm
    animals (nutrition, behavior, diseases, treatments). Table 2 summarizes platform
    used to implement use cases in Smart Farming classified following our four categories.

    in Smart Irrigation in which they showed that data is stored in the database or
    in the cloud. On 151 reviewed papers, one uses Raspberry Pi, 18 databases, 53
    clouds, and 79 are self-developed or not mentioned (Garcia et al., 2020). Navarro
    et al. identified 21 Platforms used in 50 various use cases classified into 5
    categories: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Machine Learning, Computer Vision,
    and Other/Not Identified (Navarro et al., 2020). Jayaraman et al. present SmartFarmNet,
    an IoT platform offering effortless integration of sensors, supporting scalable
    data analytics, and proposing do-it-yourself tools to analyze and visualize data
    (Jayaraman et al., 2016). Codeluppi et al. describe LoRaFarM a general architecture
    modulated depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements (Codeluppi
    et al., 2020). The monitoring of crops particularly more sensitive to them as
    saffron is crucial. The DIAS Architecture (Triantafyllou et al., 2019) uses different
    ground and leaf sensors to monitor the real-time 24/24 h cultivation process of
    saffron. This data is transmitted by LoRaWAN with IPv6 protocol and MQTT-SN protocol
    to FIWARE’s context broker. The broker manages all networking devices by means
    of sixteen types of messages exchanged following publish-subscribe model. The
    FIWARE NGSI API of oversees the consumption, subscription, and processing of all
    the information collected and its publication. Afterward, the data is stored and
    analyzed with a random forest algorithm which allows extracting information about
    the crop growth and health. Vegetation indexes: Normalized Difference Index (NDI),
    Excess Greenness Index (ExG) are calculated with PiX4D3 image processing tools.
    Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is used to recognize weeds or discriminate
    species. Finally, collected data are categorized and evaluated accordingly with
    vegetation index values, moisture level, and plant developing state by means of
    the Apache Spark framework for the Big Data analysis and Waikato Environment (WEKA)
    a framework specialized in data mining to produce reports and predictions. Decision-making
    is a very important task in the farmers’ activities but with the amount of data
    always increasing, they encounter difficulties on one hand to make proper decision
    about agricultural management and on the other hand translate this data into practical
    knowledge (Zhai et al., 2020). On the other hand, there is a need for platforms
    of the Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) to assist farmers to make precise
    decisions evidence-based. For example, Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture
    combines IBM Watson with IoT and Cloud Computing to detect crop disease from UAV
    images. It is also possible to optimize time for crop operations to obtain a better
    price on trading market. The second example is Digital Farming System4 takes advantage
    of computer vision, cloud computing, and AI to propose a better timing for corp
    operations, notify when a crop is infected by any disease. Smart Irrigation Decision
    Support System (SIDSS) is composed on one hand of a set of sensors and a weather
    station and on the other hand a DSS based on two machine learning algorithms.
    Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to deduct unnecessary variables and Adaptive
    Neuro -Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) used to minimize estimated errors under
    a target threshold (Navarro-Hellin et al., 2016). SIDSS generates planning of
    water amount and time for irrigation. Multi-robot sense-act system (Conesa-Munoz
    et al., 2016) is a planner of aerial and ground vehicles which assign tasks to
    the most appropriate work units. A Harmony Search Algorithm is used to optimize
    plans for UAVs while meta heuristic is running for ground vehicles. 2.3. Analysis
    of previous literature The analysis of existing reviews about smart farming shows
    that applications use whether open source or commercial cloud architecture whether
    developing specific architecture responding to their aims or do not describe their
    storage and processing system. The latter represents more than half of the papers
    and means that some of the processing architectures remain unknown because they
    have never been specifically described and studied. Moreover, the fact that further
    development is being made in architecture may be the fact that commercial platforms
    do not fully address the needs of Agriculture 4.0. This brings us to our research
    questions and their respective motivation: 1. Which storage and processing architectures
    are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address its particularities?
    Motivation: On one hand generic architectures dedicated or not to IoT are able
    to address a large number of use cases but not specifically the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 exist. On the other hand, researchers develop architectures to address specific
    issues or requirements of use cases. The selection of an adapted architecture
    is crucial for the correct implementation of identified use cases. 2. Can generic
    architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? Motivation:
    Agriculture 4.0 has specific requirements described in the introduction section
    which cannot all be addressed by a single classical generic architecture. A comparison
    between the pros and the cons of major generic architecture in the context of
    agriculture 4.0 is important to highlight the choice during the conceptualization
    step. 3. What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that allow the transition
    from research to industrialization? Motivation: The use of architectural solutions
    which can be for example free of fees during the research phase but needs a reimplementation
    caused by license limitations, the cost of the license in the use cases budget,
    etc. The use of products in closed or semi-closed ecosystems is a barrier to the
    research valuation. 4. What are the vertical valuation possibilities to move from
    algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded or autonomous products? Motivation:
    The massive collection of data in the cloud allows to development of complex algorithms
    that need a large amount of computing resources to be elaborated. Afterward, they
    can be compressed, reduced, optimized in order to be deployed in embedded devices
    or divided and establish a collaboration between devices and computing resources
    such as cloud, fog, etc. In order to answer these questions, a review of the literature
    will make it possible to synthesize the different approaches currently used, to
    identify new trends and to consider new lines of research to be explored. 3. Methodology
    In order to address, our first and second research questions, we achieve a systematic
    review to identify generic architectures and combination of architectural elements
    used by researchers to implement concrete use cases. Moreover, we attempt also
    identify commercial products and existing services/ platforms used to implement
    projects in agriculture. 3.1. Systematic review methodology The research questions
    outlined at the end of the related work section has been addressed by combining
    keywords of the first group that refers to architectures (i.e. cloud architecture,
    distributed architecture, big data, Internet of Things, IoT) and of the second
    group contained keywords related to agriculture (i.e. agriculture, smart farming,
    food, agri-food, precision agriculture). Our methodology is based on 3 consecutive
    steps: literature identification, reading literature, and information extraction.
    During the first step, we have read and have collected individual papers based
    on the achieved of previous papers. We have reviewed and completed by a systematic
    survey of white literature (full articles and conference papers) from January
    2016 to December 2020. In addition, we targeted solely and exclusively papers
    written in English and focusing on architecture design have been considered. Our
    bibliographic review was limited to the last 5 years because the rapid development
    of IoT. The systematic review was retrieved from the following major bibliographic
    databases: Scopus (Elsevier), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Wiley Online Library,
    ACM Digital Library, and Springer. These bibliographic databases have been chosen
    widely covering relevant bibliography and relevant advanced bibliometric features
    especially number of citation and relevant literature suggestion. From these databases
    1058 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. After their screening 55 papers were
    classified relevant while remaining articles were considerate not relevant and
    therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. The high number of excluded
    papers is due to numerous papers describe i.e. conceptual or theoretic architectures
    which were never implemented, experimental architectures that have been the subject
    of a single article or that have never been proven by other research teams. We
    discard also papers that were not a directly related Big data and the agricultural
    sector. Table 3. Table 3. Keywords used for achieved the systematic review. Area

    (reports, blogs, magazines, and web-items) into our review using Web of Science
    and Google Scholar. Table 4. We discarded papers that were written in other languages
    than English, Master and doctoral dissertation, and duplicated articles gathered
    from Google Scholar. Afterward, we have selected literature that has carefully
    been read in detail to extract relevant information of research questions. The
    extracted information was analyzed and summarized in a conceptual framework illustrated
    in the Fig. 1. Table 4. Sources of collected literature. Data source URL IEEE

    Three ways of treatment of data are possible. The first process data in real-time
    (left branch identified by (1) on Fig. 1), this one is generally not stored except
    eventually particular or exceptional data in order to enrich the training database
    of artificial intelligence algorithms. This way of data treatment is used for
    example by robots that inspect a crop, discover a pest, and then eliminate it.
    After intervention the value data is near null. The second way is a mixed way
    in which data must be processed as quickly as possible. This one addresses use
    cases where latency required must be comprised between few milliseconds to few
    seconds with data, which conserves a value during a certain period of time. This
    latter justifies its storage according to the use case data management plan that
    predicts the time after which the data will be aggregated and then deleted. This
    way in identified by (2) on Fig. 1. It addresses use cases where all data must
    be processed and then stored for eventual post-processing for example to estimate
    trends of parameters such as the milk quality, volume of palatable species available
    in a pasture. The third way is stored data theirs native format without transformation
    (Identified by (3) on Fig. 1). This way is implemented on use cases that do not
    require real time processing or use cases where the amount data is so important,
    which makes treatment impossible. In this latter case, data are consumed by micro
    services that sample data to exact knowledge. This way is also employed for data
    which have a low value or lose their value so quickly that there is no point in
    transforming them for long-term storage. For instance, a UGV identifies and eliminates
    a pest. The image of the insect is no longer relevant after its elimination. 3.2.
    Architecture comparison criteria In order to compare selected architectures, we
    chose to select 8 criteria:(1) User Proximity expresses the necessity to be close
    to the user. This criterion is important for applications where privacy and response
    time to query are critical. Attribute a value of one * when privacy is not crucial;
    ** when the proximity with user is desirable but not crucial for the development
    of the use case; *** when the user proximity is the corner stone of the application.
    (2) Latency & Jitter criterion describes the importance for the architecture to
    have a minimal latency and jitter. This criterion is particularly important for
    use cases where response time to query in quasi (real time) is required and/or
    time between data production and ingestion by the processing and storage architecture
    is essential. (3) Network stability criterion translate the necessity to have
    a stable network or if is interruption can be tolerated. Use a value of * if the
    use case implemented can tolerate the absence of network during few hours; **
    if few minutes of interruption are tolerable; *** is stability of the network
    is an essential element of the use case. (4) The high throughput criterion expresses
    the capability of the architecture to process quickly a wide amount of data arriving
    at high frequency; Use a value of * if the data arrive mostly at regular intervals;
    a value of ** if the data arrive in bursts, and *** if the data arrive continuously
    at high frequency (10 Hz). (5) Reliability is a criterion that expresses if the
    infrastructure is critical in other terms whether an interruption in infrastructure
    could cause loss of life or not. Attribute a weight of * if the data is not critical
    and potential damages caused by an interruption of the architecture are minors
    or null; ** if potential damageable but tolerable if they occur more than once
    a year; *** if the application cannot tolerate any interruption which would cause
    irreversible damage or loss of human life. (6) Scalability is a criterion that
    expresses the regularity of the evolution in terms of processing and storage during
    a period of one year. If the scalability must be achieved at most once a year
    use a weight of *; if the scalability is achieved at most twice a year use **;
    if the scalability must be achieved more than two times by year use a weight of
    ***. (7) Cost-Effectiveness criterion reflects the need to control infrastructure
    costs. This criterion is more important as the infrastructure is brought to evolve
    both in terms of scale and complexity. Use the weight of * if the project will
    remain in a relatively constant size and do not need to be scaled or dramatically
    modified; Use **, if the project evolves reasonably, i.e. should not undergo significant
    modification more than once a year. Use a weight of *** if the size of the project
    and/ or its complexity need a fine study of cost. (8) Maintainability criterion
    is directly linked to the sustainability of the project. If the sustainability
    of the project will not exceed two years to allocate a point of *; if the life
    of the project is between 2 and 5 years, assign a score of ** beyond 5 years,
    assign ***. 4. Architectures The numerous publications dealing with cloud architectures
    relating to Agriculture 4.0, summarized in Table 2, show that a great deal of
    effort has been devoted to solving a whole range of problems related to many use
    cases. Indeed, a universal and a unique architecture do not exist for IoT applications
    in Smart Agriculture which ensure all needs of all use cases. This is the reason
    why several researchers have proposed various architectures which address specific
    issues of generic architectures. The Fig. 2 gives a global overview on Agriculture
    4.0 organization. Download : Download high-res image (340KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global structure of IoT in Agriculture 4.0. 4.1. Central
    Cloud Architectures Central Cloud Architectures are based on two basic architectures
    that are associated or combined in order to form modern architectures. These two
    architectures are: Batch Architecture aims to process an entire dataset in an
    offline mode. For this type of architectures, as long as the processing of the
    dataset is not finished, it continues and produces results only when it has reached
    its end. Generally, the data is selected and distributed to different nodes in
    order to be processed more quickly. When all the treatments are achieved on all
    nodes, the results are sorted and aggregated to obtain a global output. This architecture
    is easily implemented, and the aggregation is done by a framework, but processing
    times can be long, and data extracted during the treatment cannot be processed
    before the end of the treatment in progress. Furthermore, it is possible to increment
    results of previous batch and produce a result that integrates treated data in
    progress. Sallah et al. used a batch architecture to update data within the AquaCrop
    model (FAO) embedded in R-environment in order to facilitate model calibration
    and validation, run and evaluate all fields in a single run (Sallah et al., 2019).
    Nolack Fote et al. presented an architecture to extract knowledge on the long
    term from data in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) (Fote et al., 2020). Table
    5. Table 5. Pros and Cons of Batch Architecture. Pros Cons - Easy to implement
    and maintain. - Process only data previously stored in another form (file, database,
    etc). - Able to achieve long term treatments (several hours or days). - Processing
    cannot be modified before the end of the treatment. - Reprocessing of old data
    that are easy to achieve. - Results available only at the end of the treatment.
    Real-time Architecture also named Streaming Architecture processes data as it
    arrives, and results are progressively available by opposition to the batch architecture
    where it is not necessary to wait for the end of ingestion of all input data to
    obtain a result. The notion of real-time is strongly dependent on the analysis
    context with a processing time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Real-time
    architecture can be implemented in two different ways. On one hand with micro-batch
    in which a tiny amount of data is processed each n seconds and a result is obtained
    at the end of the treatment or on the other hand with a streaming approach in
    which each new data is immediately processed and output is quickly produced. This
    architecture is limited to data flow processing (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016).
    Table 6. Table 6. Pros and Cons of Real-time Architecture. Pros Cons - Allow a
    rapid treatment of newly arrived data. - Not able to achieve processing on large
    size of the batch. - Batch processing can be emulated using micro batches but
    not all algorithms can be implemented. - Reprocessing of old data difficult to
    implement. - Easy to implement and maintain. - The need for real-time processing
    involves the use of an estimator rather than the precise values that would take
    too long to be calculated. Various data are produced by different fields or animals
    sensors, vehicles, and robots of the Agriculture 4.0. Afterward, this data must
    be on one hand stored in a raw state and processed in an offline way where long
    and complex treatments can be achieved. On the other hand, data can be processed
    before its storing with offline processing, streaming processing, or a combination
    of these ones. The storage time is extremely variable following the nature of
    the data and their loss of value over time. Offline processing is classically
    used to process images from UAVs, UGVs, or satellites, for example, to determine
    photosynthesis activity, evaluate the canopy development or stocks of palatable
    species available in a pasture, etc. While Streaming processing allows detecting
    anomalies in animals’ behaviors in real-time, or during agricultural operations
    such as the harvesting, disease and pest detection, weeds elimination. In these
    last cases, data is not stored because it quickly loses all value after its ingestion.
    Finally, a combination of the two previous ways i.e. Offline and Streaming processing
    is used to estimate real-time metrics and achieve complex treatments in an offline
    way at the same time. This approach is used by milking robots which detect anomalies
    in the production in real-time while the offline processing estimates the future
    production of each cow based on previous milking (Debauche et al., 2021). Lambda
    architectures are used in systems that need to process and expose quickly massive
    amounts of streaming data. This cloud architecture was proposed by Nathan Marz
    and James Warren (Marz and Warren, 2013) to handle tremendous quantities of data
    and resolve complex problems combining processing large volumes of data (Batch)
    while incorporating the most recent data processed in real-time processes (Singh
    et al., 2019). This architecture is generic, scalable, and fault-tolerant against
    hardware failures and human mistakes. The architecture is composed of three layers:
    (1) batch layer process very large quantities of data by batch; (2) speed layer
    which processes data in real-time and provides views based on the most recent
    data and (3) serving layer responding to queries. Data comes from either a data
    source or a message queue. This paradigm allows executing arbitrary queries over
    any real-time data and is particularly adapted for critical infrastructure and
    health systems (Diaz et al., 2016). Several implementations of Lambda Architecture
    in smart Environment management, big data storage and analytics can be found in
    (Villari et al., 2014). Among the criticisms that have been made against lambda
    architecture is the need to make twice the developments for the real-time branch
    and the batch branch. It is possible to perform a batch processing and in real
    time with flow processing is what the Kappa architecture described below does
    (Kreps, 2014). Fig. 3 Table 7. Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download

    Pros and Cons of Lambda Architecture. Pros Cons - Process data in real-time or
    in batch processing in separate ways. The reliability of two ways of treatment
    is most costly than other architectures if the two execute the same treatment.
    Among use cases in agriculture 4.0 using a lambda, we would like to highlight:
    Roukh et al. proposed WALLeSMART, a cloud platform based on lambda and specifically
    developed for Smart Farming. This platform implements Apache Kafka to store temporary
    data before their treatment. Apache Hadoop and the programming model Mapreduce
    is used for the batch processing while Apache Storm process data in realtime.
    The originality of this architecture is the coupling of a NoSQL database Apache
    Casandra and a SQL database, PostgreSQL where data is stored in the function of
    its nature. The GraphQL query language allows to querying databases. (Roukh et
    al., 2020, Roukh et al., 2020). Debauche et al. describe a lambda architecture
    for digital phenotyping (Debauche et al., 2020) and farm animals’ behaviors coupled
    with an Application Hosting Architecture based on Apache Mesos and Docker containerization
    to facilitate the deployment of various applications. An API interconnects and
    controls accesses between the Lambda Architecture and the Hosting Application
    Architecture. The Lambda architecture is based on Apache Beam to easily change
    the runner in the function of the technology evolution and improve its sustainability.
    Apache Druid is used to store time series data (Debauche et al., 2019) and metadata
    of data stored in the Datalake based on Apache Hadoop (Debauche et al., 2018).
    A variant of this architecture, named Unified Lambda architecture combines batch
    and stream pipelines which runs concurrently, and then the results are merged
    automatically (Siciliani, 2015). AllJoyn Lambda integrates AllJoyn a framework
    that offers: (1) proximal devices and applications discovering; (2) specific devices
    framework adapting; (3) transmission between devices with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.;
    (4) interoperability between operating systems; (5) efficient and secure data
    exchange through D-BUS (Villari et al., 2014). The Kappa architecture, proposed
    by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps, 2014), simplifies the Lambda architecture by
    combining real-time and batch layers. This cloud architecture differs from the
    Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent storage system of data in an unchangeable
    log file such as system as Apache Spark or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow
    only storage for a limited time in order to allow an eventual reprocessing of
    these data. Batch and Speed Layers are also replaced by a stream processing engine.
    So, the Kappa Architecture is composed of two layers: streaming and serving layers
    and can be implemented with a publish-subscribe messaging like Apache Kafka, which
    facilitates data ingestion. Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (121KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Kappa Architecture General Scheme.
    The main advantage of this architecture is its simplicity. It avoids having to
    maintain two separate code bases for the batch and speed layers. When processing
    on real-time and historical data are the same, a Kappa Architecture must be used.
    Fast Data Architecture is a variant of Kappa Architecture in which the data are
    no longer read from files but from an additional mechanism like Kafka that captures
    multiple streams combines them before being processed by the speed layer (Lakhe,
    2016). Persico et al. achieved a benchmark of Lambda and Kappa architectures and
    show that Lambda outperforms Kappa for social networks data (YFCC100M) processing
    (Persico et al., 2018). Table 8. Table 8. Pros and Cons of Kappa Architecture.
    Pros Cons - Very efficient for real-time processing thanks to in-memory processing.
    - Batch processing emulates thanks to micro-batch treated via the real-time way.
    - Optimized cost because allows real-time and batch processing. - Not able to
    process large batch size. - Must be finely tuned from data to obtain the best
    performances (Nkamla Penka et al., 2021). Other Architectures derived or inspired
    of the previous architectures have been developed to address specific problems
    such as (1) SMACK (Estrada and Ruiz, 2016) which attempts to propose an optimal
    architecture with fixed components; (2) Liquid (Fernandez et al., 2015) is an
    architecture which provide low latency, incremental processing, high available
    with isolated resource, and able to store high throughput data at low operational
    cost architecture; (3) Butterfly (Lakhe, 2016) proposes to unify batch, speed
    and serving layers in a unique platform in which data are organized as a collection
    of three types of abstractions; (4) Zeta (Scott, 2015) which integrates a lambda
    architecture with business aspect of the enterprise; (5) BRAID (Giebler et al.,
    2018) is a hybrid processing architecture where all coming data and configuration
    file of processing, and eventually processing results written back are stored
    in a shared storage; (6) IoT-a (Hausenblas, 2014) is composed of three blocks:
    Ad-hoc queries, a Database, and a Distributed File System; (7) Polystore (Meehan
    et al., 2016) implements a multiple database system PostgreSQL, SciDB and Accumulo
    because a database alone cannot store all types of data efficiently. Table 9.

    analysis of the literature achieved shows that two major generic architectures:
    Kappa and Lambda allows to address of various use cases and are widely implemented
    and proven in other domains of the Internet of Things. The Lambda is more expensive
    to implement than the Kappa because of the need to maintain two separate parallel
    processing branches for stream processing and batch processing. It is interesting
    if different processing are carried out on the two processing branches. Otherwise,
    a Kappa architecture with a single processing branch that processes both the streams
    and the data in batches is more appropriate in most cases because it is cheaper
    and easier to maintain because a single code performs both types of processing
    (stream and batch). Looking at our first two research questions, we observe that
    Lambda and Kappa cloud architectures are efficient but these architectures alone
    operating in central cloud cannot address, for example, use cases where very low
    latencies are required. They will have to be hybridized and completed to address
    these particular cases. Two possibilities are available to us. The first way consists
    in associating several specialized cloud platforms to make it possible to obtain
    greater genericity or at least to better cover a domain. The second consists of
    supplementing the cloud-centric architectures that we have just mentioned with
    other architectural elements in order to better address the specific needs of
    Agriculture 4.0. 4.2. Extension of the cloud paradigm With the increase of the
    amount of data produced by the myriad of connected things, the amount of data
    to process, to transfer by network, and to treat in the cloud computing have called
    into question the architecture of storage and data processing. To solve the problem,
    two ways have been proposed, the first is Multi-Cloud Computing, the objective
    of which is to ensure redundancy in order to improve latency. The second is the
    Federated Cloud with the aim of pooling resources for better use. Multi-Cloud
    Computing (MCC) (Manyika and Chui, 2015) is an extension of Cloud Computing paradigm
    where services are distributed on multi-clouds. In this architecture the workflow
    is distributed entirely in the cloud, data redundancy is also verified. One advantage
    of the MCC is the high recovery rate but it has the same disadvantages as Cloud
    Computing, along with complexity and portability issues. Kazim et al. proposed
    a framework to deliver IoT services and establish cooperation across multi-clouds.
    An authentication allows communicating cloud to authenticate each other cloud
    dynamically. While a service selects the best IoT service matching with user requirements
    among multiple clouds and taking into account the SLA parameters agreed between
    the user and the provider (Kazim et al., 2018). Federated Cloud (FC) aggregates
    resources of multiple cloud providers to improve users’ freedom and allows users
    to choose where they want to deploy their applications. A Federated cloud can
    be defined as a voluntary collaboration between heterogeneous cloud providers
    collaborating to share their own unused resources. Using a cloud federation helps
    to ensure service performance during load ups with resources borrowed from other
    clouds. In addition, the geographical dispersion of the installations makes it
    possible to migrate to another installation and to guarantee the service in case
    of breakdown. A unified interface allows to use it an easy consultation of the
    offered services. Finally, thanks to the dynamic distribution of the load, it
    is possible to bring the treatment closer to the user and consequently improve
    the Quality of Service (Assis and Bittencourt, 2016). Cloud federations include
    European Federated Cloud (Sipos et al., 2013), Massachusetts Open Cloud, Mosaic
    (Petcu et al., 2013), IEEE P2302, and Open stack Keystone. Drakos et al. described
    agINFA, a common research data infrastructure for agriculture, food and the environment
    using EGI Federated Cloud. This infrastructure allows to partner to share research
    infrastructure components, APIs, a registry of web-based information service and
    dataset for agriculture (Drakos et al., 2015). 4.3. Distributed architectures
    The post-cloud approaches allow to improve latency and jitter for immobile entities
    but do not provide an answer adapted for mobile devices and local awareness. The
    large amount of data generated at the edge has increased the speed of data transportation
    that is becoming the bottleneck for the cloud-based computing paradigms (Shi et
    al., 2016). Moreover, the treatment of data in the cloud does not offer any guarantees
    about privacy, on the response time and real-time actuation because the huge number
    of devices increases the latency and jitter. Moreover, the mobility of devices
    and power constraints makes the communicaion difficult with the cloud all the
    time (Botta et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2017). The aim has been to bring data storage
    and processes data, filtering, and data analysis closer to data-producing objects
    to limit bandwidth consumption and relieve the cloud. Three major paradigms have
    been proposed to address these issues and bring cloud computing-like capabilities
    to the edge of the network. All these infrastructures manage mechanisms of Virtual
    Machine (VM) or containers migration and adjust if needed, the provisioning of
    capabilities where users are located. Moreover, the three paradigms allow the
    creation of federated infrastructures in which can coexist multiple edge infrastructures
    which can exchange information and services (Roman et al., 2018). 4.4. Elements
    of distributed architectures In order to always bring closer, the processing capacities
    of intermediate processing have been set up between connected objects and the
    cloud at the network level (Fog Computing) and at the level of telephony providers
    (Mobile Edge Computing). Fog Computing is a concept created by Cisco Systems and
    is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm (Munir et al., 2017) in which
    computation, storage and network services are provided between end devices and
    cloud/ classify and analyze the raw IoT data streams at near-edge and edge network
    level (Cisco, 2018). Fog nodes are either physical components such as gateways,
    switches, routers, servers etc. or virtual components such as virtualized switches,
    virtual machines, cloudlets, etc.; deployed following private, community, public
    or hybrid. Private nodes are reserved for a single organization, community nodes
    are used by a community, public nodes are dedicated to the general public, and
    hybrid mix the third previous modalities (Uehara, 2017). This paradigm allows
    to limit data transfer on cloud, reduce latency (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), and
    jitter thanks to a three-tier architecture (Roman et al., 2018). In this hierarchical
    architecture, the analysis of local information is achieved at the low level and
    the coordination and global analysis are performed at the top level. The Fog Computing
    supports mobile devices (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), response time in real-time
    or predictable latency (Lopez et al., 2015), bandwidth saving, an improving of
    security and resilience, scalability, multi-tenancy, advanced analytics, and automation
    (Byers, 2017), cost-effective services (Yang, 2017). Fog Computing allows also
    the federation of fog infrastructures in order to allow cooperation between multiple
    organizations (Roman et al., 2018). Furthermore, the architecture is optimized
    for a use case and applications which must run on them (Byers, 2017). Fog Computing
    differentiates from cloud computing mainly by the proximity with end-users at
    the edge of networks localized or distributed geographically consisting in many
    relatively less resourceful (Munir et al., 2017). In addition to network equipment,
    fog computing can also be carried out in cloudlets and micro data centers. Cloudlets
    were proposed to address the end-to-end responsiveness between mobile devices
    and associated clouds. Cloudlets (Mach and Becvar, 2017) are micro data center
    geographically deployed in vicinity of End Users. This mobility-enhanced small-scale
    cloud data center is composed of computers with high computation power which provide
    both computation resources and storage. Cloudlet is much more agile (highly dynamic
    provisioning) than cloud due to user mobility churning. The mobility of users
    implies the use of a virtual machine to rapidly instantiate compute-intensive
    and latency-intensive applications and migrate the offloaded services between
    different cloudlet in the function of the user mobility. Cloudlets must be firstly
    discovered, selected among several candidates before starting provisioning. At
    the end of the session, the instance is destroyed (Ai et al., 2018). Cloudlets
    are accessed by mobile user equipment via Wi-Fi imply a high latency caused by
    the network and switch between mobile network and Wi-Fi and by consequence Quality
    of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) are hard to fulfill (Mach and
    Becvar, 2017, Manyika and Chui, 2015). Moreover, Cloudlets cover usually a small
    region and do not offer any guarantee on ubiquitous computing and scalability
    in service (Manyika and Chui, 2015). MicroData Centers (MDCs) were proposed by
    Microsoft Research. It is designed to extend cloud data centers as cloudlets.
    MDCs are enclosures contemning all types of equipments (computing, storage, network)
    needed to provide a secure computing environment in order to run customs applications
    requiring low latency. MDCs are also well adapted to provide processing resources
    to end devices on battery or with limited computing capabilities. MDCs can be
    adapted in function network bandwidth and user needs thanks to certain flexibility
    in terms of latency and scalability of the capacity (Wang et al., 2020). Guardo
    et al. proposed a framework composed of two fog layers respectively filtering
    and aggregating data, and clustering analysis, actuation management, and alert.
    The framework aims to improve computational load balancing between fog and cloud
    in order to reduce the amount of data to transmit to the cloud, reduce the waiting
    time for the user (Guardo et al., 2018). Taneja et al. proposed a SmartHerd an
    IoT platform dedicated to smart dairy farming based on microservices and Fog-assisted.
    The IoT gateway received data from transceivers, archived data aggregation, preprocessing,
    classification, feature selection, send critical alerts to farmers, and transmit
    data to IBM Watson IoT platform via MQTT protocol. In the IBM Watson IoT platform,
    a broker picks up data and store them in a Cloudant NoSQL JSON Database. Python
    Virtual Machine and Java Virtual Machine were used as containers equivalent for
    microservices deployment at fog level (Taneja et al., 2019). Sharofidinov et al.
    described a 4 layers architecture (Sensors Layers, Fog Layer, Network/Cloud Layer,
    and Application Layer) based on LoRa to monitor and predict the state of a greenhouse
    from a random forest algorithm. In the Sensor Layer, sensors acquire temperature,
    soil and air humidity, CO2 rate, and illumination connected to TTGO LoRa32 (ESP32
    with LoRa Sx1276 chip) which are transmitted to the gateway by LoRa. At Fog Layer,
    preliminary analysis with Machine Learning algorithm, diagnosis of sensor status,
    and data compression are achieved. In the Network/Cloud Layer, compressed data
    are transmitted in order to be deeply analyzed and stored. Finally, in the Application
    Layer, analyzed data are converted in readable form to allows the monitoring and
    the control of the greenhouse (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Table 10. Table 10.
    Pros and Cons of Fog Computing. Pros Cons - Fast response time in avoiding transmission
    of data to the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). - Failure or outage of the gateway
    can defeat thousands of devices. - The local storage and processing capabilities
    prevent data loss and outages when the Internet connectivity is limited (Sharofidinov
    et al., 2020). - The limited processing and memory capacities do not allow the
    deployment of algorithms requiring significant resources or the carrying out of
    long-term processing. - Sensitive data can be filtered locally. In this case,
    only the data model is moved in the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020), and data
    validation, compression, and encryption. - Gateway at fog level ensure the compatibility
    between old and modern devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020) and various protocols
    for communication. - Improve the resilience thanks to the decentralization of
    the treatment on network devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) was proposed by ETSI and is deployed by telecommunication companies on the
    edge of the network, which is characterized by ultra-low latency and high bandwidth.
    (Roman et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2017). At the very beginning, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) aims to bring real-time, high-bandwidth, and low-latency access to dependent
    applications known as cloud computing capabilities; in addition to, information
    technology (IT) features of cloud computing. MEC is distributed at the edge of
    the network. In fact, a new class of cloud-native applications are easily accessible,
    because of the close position of Edge Computing to the end user and apps. Also,
    it allows network operators to open their environment to a new ecosystem. As a
    result of this significant change, MEC application can be used in LTE macro base
    stations (eNBs), 3G radio network controllers (RNCs), Wi-Fi access points, edge
    network routers, and enterprise edge servers. MEC platform contains two main hosting
    infrastructures. The first is formed by hardware resources and a high-resolution
    screen. The second is composed of manageable applications with numerous capabilities
    such as the application of virtualization manager and platform services (Zhou
    et al., 2017). An important challenge for the MEC is the VM migration that must
    optimize the tradeoff between migration gain and migration cost and select optimal
    location (Ai et al., 2018). Tran et al. investigated the collaborative Mobile
    Edge Computing in 5G Networks. MEC extends processing and storage resources at
    the edge of the Radio Access Network (RAN) while C-RAM is based on centralization
    of the base Station by means of the virtualization. Authors argue that both technologies
    are complementary in the 5G ecosystem (Tran et al., 2017). Fig. 5 Table 11. Download

    Mobile Edge Computing General Scheme. Table 11. Pros and Cons of MEC. Pros Cons
    - Reduces needs in connection, response time delay, the congestion of other parts
    of the network (Valecce et al., 2019). - Usable only for devices connected in
    Wi-Fi or 3GPP. - Use low level message from Wi-Fi to determine the location of
    each device (Location awareness) (Valecce et al., 2019). - MEC Server can be used
    as power open to applications and services (Valecce et al., 2019). Fan et al.
    combined MEC with data link management, combining with the industrial CAN bus
    characteristics to monitor water. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) Altera
    implementing the AVALON bus was used to implement the system. Moreover, they propose
    a protocol to model random network disturbances and an online task offloading
    algorithm based on the monitoring of task execution (Fan and Gao, 2018). Valecce
    et al. proposed a 5G-robotics reference architecture for smart agriculture composed
    of UAV-Based Monitoring and connectivity, Machinery automation, and MEC Applications
    Server. UAVs/satellites capture high-resolution images during patrolling, which
    coupled with sensors data trigger a precise crop management. UAVs can also collect
    data or serve as a 5G mobile station. In field, image processing coupled with
    sensors data can be used for decision making. MEC allows to process gigabyte/s
    of data produced by autonomous vehicles and robots (Valecce et al., 2019). Table

    ** ** Maintainability ** ** The development of fog computing and its counterpart
    for MEC wireless networks allow processing capabilities closer to users to improve
    response time but with lower computational capacities compared to the cloud. There
    are inherently two questions: Which association strategies to use between the
    cloud and the other levels of processing in the network? How to distribute the
    load between these different levels: local (Edge), network (Fog), and Cloud processing.
    4.5. Collaborative computing strategies In order to address, our fourth research
    question, we try to identify different possibilities to compose architectural
    elements. Indeed, different collaboration strategies between the different levels
    of data processing (cloud, fog, edge) can be considered depending on the particularities
    of the use cases. In the next paragraphs, we describe possibilities of collaboration
    between different treatment entries, and we illustrate each one with few examples.
    Edge-Cloud aims to connect devices directly with the cloud that performs data
    processing. This strategy is often used by UAVs and UGVs which preprocess data
    before its transfer to the cloud because image treatment needs processing power
    and storage capabilities. The default of this approach is that the delay of the
    whole process from data transfer via high throughput wireless or cellular protocol
    to the transmission of processing results cannot be guaranteed because of the
    fluctuation of data rates linked to wireless networks (Wang et al., 2020). The
    processing of data can be achieved in an online mode with a real-time data transmission
    and processing by a stream, Lambda, Kappa or derived architecture of these one.
    An offline strategy with a data transfer by means of a computer and Internet connection
    on the cloud after the UAV fly and processing with a Batch, a Lambda, or a Kappa
    architecture or a derived architecture of these one is also possible. This latter
    costly avoid data transmission and is suitable for monitoring crops or livestock
    that do not require direct action. Agriculture 4.0 uses in particular Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors in order to improve the time
    of data collection, in reducing the cost of acquisition compared to traditional
    field phenotyping technologies. According to Tang et al., edge-cloud is majorly
    used in smart robots to reduce complexity (Tang et al., 2021). Indeed, the images
    of drones to be used must be orthorectified and assembled. These operations require
    significant resources in terms of computing power, and memory. All these collected
    data must be rapidly processed, analyzed, and visualized. Agroview (Ampatzidis
    et al., 2020) is a platform that developed a cloud and AI-based application to
    survey and assess the agriculture field, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    A website allows the upload of images or existing orthomosaic, the consultation
    for each tree field e.g., number of trees, tree gaps count, area of the field,
    the average height of trees, canopy area, etc. The website also allows the stitching
    of an orthomosaic and the generation of a Digital Surface Model (DSM). A tree
    detection algorithm developed in C allows the detection of individual tree and
    tree gap, and estimate tree parameters such as height, canopy area, health/stress
    estimation. The pipeline of treatment uses a Faster R-CNN to detect the region
    of interest (ROI) and the ResNet101 network allows to detect trees and row orientation.
    Afterward, the Yolo classifier using Darknet19 was applied along each row of trees
    to obtain a more precise detection. Debauche et al. presented an Edge-Cloud architecture
    for the analysis of cattle behavior from 9-DOF IMU data sampled at 100 Hz and
    GPS location sampled at 0.5 Hz that is then processed with an algorithm proposed
    by (Andriamandroso et al., 2017) in batch processing (Debauche et al., 2019, Debauche
    et al., 2020). Popescu et al. proposed an integrated system UAV-WSN-IoT where
    WSN data is collected by UAVs before their transmission to the ground control
    station and afterward to the cloud (Popescu et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    an architecture for scientific research dedicated to honeybee Colony Collapse
    Disorder. In this architecture, data is compressed on LoPy at the edge level before
    its collection by the LoRaWan gateway and its transmission to the Lambda architecture
    in the cloud where it is processed (Debauche et al., 2018). Edge-Fog aims to connect
    devices directly with network components such as gateways, routers that perform
    data processing. The major benefits of this approach are an optimization of the
    bandwidth, a reduction of traffic and latency, a better privacy, and an improved
    security level (Badidi, 2020). Fog nodes collect, aggregate, filter, encrypt,
    compress, and process IoT data (Gupta et al., 2020). This way is used for example
    by milking robots where data are processed by a computer close the robot and can
    be viewed remotely by the farmer. 5G also promotes mobile edge computing (MEC).
    Debauche et al. presented an AI-IoT architecture for the deployment of Artificial
    intelligence algorithms and Internet of things services at fog level using docker
    containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. This architecture has been developed
    to automatically deploy AI algorithms after retraining when performances (accuracy,
    recall, precision) are improved (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    a Multi-Agent System (MAS) deployed at edge level allowing to control abnormal
    data present in sensed data and eventually cure this data when it is possible.
    The MAS simultaneously manages pivot irrigation, plant diseases and pests'' detection,
    and their curation. The data is partially transmitted to the cloud to improve
    the detection of diseases and pests and retrain AI algorithms before their redeployment
    at the edge level (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. described a fog architecture
    in which a Gated Recursive Unit (GRU) algorithm is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano
    for real-time poultry monitoring. GRU is simpler than LSTM algorithm. GRU is built
    to avoid varnish gradient problems. Periodically data is transmitted to the user
    interface implemented in NodeJS in the cloud (Debauche et al., 2020). Edge-Fog-Cloud
    is a paradigm in which data are partially processed in the fog and more complex
    treatments are achieved in the cloud. This way is used by wireless Sensor and
    Actuator Network (WSAN), which passes through a gateway that provides interconnection
    between the devices and the backhaul which transit then data to the cloud. However,
    the right balance between cloud and edge/fog computing is required (Badidi, 2020)
    based on available resources and whether or not the task is sensitive. Taneja
    et al. used a strategy Edge-Fog-Cloud to develop a detection system of lameness
    for cattle. The data from the pedometer is transmitted to the Fog node by means
    of a Long-Range proprietary protocol at 433 MHz on a distance of 2 km. Fog node
    stores in local database, preprocess and aggregates them. Fog node communicates
    with IBM Watson IoT Platform with MQTT protocol. Arriving data are picked up and
    stored in Cloudant NoSQL JSON database in IBM cloud. A mobile application synchronizes
    data with PouchDB, its local database via the REST API of Cloudant database when
    an Internet connection is available (Taneja et al., 2020). Alonso et al. presented
    Global Edge Computing Architecture (GECA), a modular tiered architecture (IoT
    Layer, Edge Layer, Business Solution Layer) to monitor dairy and feed grain state
    in real-time. In this architecture, a Distributed Ledger Technologies provides
    security from IoT Layer to Business Solution Layer. In the IoT layer, a set of
    agents call oracles to verify incoming data and afterward calculate hash of data
    with SHA-256 which is stored in the blockchain to verify the non-alteration of
    data. In parallel data is encrypted with the RSA algorithm and then sent to the
    Edge layer. The Edge Layer is responsible of the preprocessing of data and filters
    out data transmitted to the cloud. It enables also various data analyses. In the
    business Solution Layer, final storage, authentication, analysis for decision
    making is achieved. It provides also a knowledge base and APIs (Alonso et al.,
    2020). Edge-Edge is a paradigm in which devices interact to collaborate, exchange,
    and process data. The deployment of the 5G network allows the interconnection
    between UAVs and UGVs/ agricultural machinery (Tang et al., 2021). This high throughput
    network will allow to developping new collaboration between UAVs/ UGVs and agricultural
    machinery, for example, a drone will provide information to a harvester to avoid
    a non-desirable area of the field or avoid obstacles. A fleet of drones can also
    collaborate to coordinate their operations on the field between them of course
    subject to availability in rural areas, a transmission network with sufficient
    bandwidth and short-latency or capabilities to communicate between them in direct
    connection or in a mesh network. (Tang et al., 2021). Four cooperation strategies
    have been identified, two of which use the cloud, namely Fog-Cloud and Edge-Cloud.
    The other two remaing, do not involve the cloud; namely, Fog-Edge, and Edge-Edge
    cloud. The first two strategies complement the cloud to help us to address issues
    relating to production data and trade secrets, network congestion, and response
    times. The other two strategies do without the cloud and therefore assume that
    the devices/ vehicles have sufficient capacity to perform the processing. Despite
    these cooperation strategies between different levels of processing, some questions
    remain unanswered: How to store all the raw data when the data is so important
    that it would take colossal means to process it? What about security? How to organize
    the distribution of tasks between the edge, the fog, and the cloud? How to ensure
    operation and/ or treatment when network connections are intermittent or faulty?
    How to improve the maintainability of these architectures? These are the questions
    that the new trends that we describe in the next paragraph attempt to answer.
    5. New trends In this section, we present two emerging architectures not based
    on the batch or/and real-time architectures or their derivatives. Afterward, we
    describe Osmotic and Dew computing as two new paradigms, which allow us to respectively
    choose where the processing must be achieved and improve the user experience.
    New trends are additional elements that allow enriching the analysis of Section
    4 in order to address the third research question. The Microservices Architecture
    (MA) is a new system software design pattern that divides complex monolithic application
    in micro services dedicated for a single function. Microservice addresses defects
    of monolithic applications in which improving of service performance needs multiple
    deployment; a change in a function can affect all the monolith due to high dependencies
    between components; all the monolith uses a sole technology stack and development
    standards which limits possibilities to solve problems of physical heterogeneity.
    The advantages of this architecture are using a lightweight communication mechanism
    to interact between services with a minimal overload (Sun et al., 2017). The design
    proposed by (Sun et al., 2017) is composed of 8 microservices (Geo, Security,
    Tenant, Devices, Big Data, Automation, AI, and Application) and a core service
    coordinating. These services provide respectively: (1) Geo, a GIS layer to render
    data; (2) Security, user/group/role management, access control, administration,
    and authentication mechanism; (3) support for multiple IoT applications with a
    single core; (4) device plugins and communication protocols for sensing and actuating;
    (5) scalable persistence to store data; (6) process, analyze events and notify
    appropriate participant; (7) Artificial intelligence tools for IoT big data; (8)
    components to interact with client interfaces; (9) support for data exchanging
    by message with the devices. Authors argue that their approach is more flexible,
    scalable and platform-independent. Fig. 6 Table 13. Download : Download high-res

    General Scheme. Table 13. Pros and Cons of Microservices Architecture. Pros Cons
    - Fractionating of monoliths facilitates the maintainability and scalability of
    low coupled microservices. - Need to find microservice adapted with needs. - The
    discovery of micro-services allows the development new applications more easily
    than with monoliths. Fraction complex monolith is not easy. - More resilient,
    when a microservice is down, all others continue to function. Bixio et al. proposed
    a stream processing architecture event-driven based on proxy, adapter, and data
    processing microservices. This architecture extends the IoT platform Senseioty
    and using the Java OSGi framework (Bixio et al., 2020). The Data Lake Architecture
    (DLA) (Fang, 2015, Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016) enables the storage of large
    volumes of data of all types: raw data in its native format, structured, semi-structured,
    in a cost-effective manner. In this architecture, data is stored in its native
    format until it needs to process them by engines (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016),
    which allows a fast transformation and refinement of stored data regardless of
    the amount of data stored. The architecture makes it possible to consume all types
    of data (logs, web services, database, files, etc.); different ingestion systems
    consume the data and then stored it in data repository. Once the data is stored,
    query systems can query the data lake. This architecture is considered in the
    corporate world as an evolution of existing architectures. The advantage of the
    Data Lake architecture is that it can easily and inexpensively store large amounts
    of data. It is particularly well suited to storing data in a typical format. In
    Enterprise Data Lakes are used; in addition to, data warehouses. Data lakes are,
    however, unsuitable for assessing data quality, data can be placed in data lakes
    without content control, and performance is also poorer than on specially designed
    and optimized infrastructures. The Lakehouse is a variant of the Data Lake where
    storages of data are generally achieved with Hadoop in the data lake is replaced
    by a distributed storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage,
    and analysis are directly achieved by infrastructure managed by Cloud Service
    Providers such as Amazon Athena, EMR, or Databricks, Google Data proc, Azure HDInsight.

    Data lake and Lakehouse General Scheme. It crucial in agriculture to explore datasets
    from different sources. The data lake is indicated to manage the complexity of
    agricultural ecosystems and centralized all data sources to find new correlations.
    (Madera et al., 2017). A data lake provides views based on metadata. It is nevertheless
    necessary to have advanced analysis tools for predictive modeling and statistical
    analysis. López et al. used a data lake to achieve the fusion of data from different
    domains in smart the agriculture context (López et al., 2020). Gallinucci et al.
    (Gallinucci et al., 2019, Gallinucci et al., 2020) present an innovative architecture
    3 tiers architecture, called Mo.Re.Farming (MOnitoring and REmote system for a
    more sustainable FARMING) based on a data lake using Apache Hadoop and storing
    structured, semi-structured, and unstructured raw data, and in which subsequent
    processing and enrichment activities are separated. An Operational Data Store
    (ODS) using PostgreSQL with PostGIS to stores structured and detailed data and
    address limitations of big data solutions in properly handling continuous field
    geographic data. Finally, a spatial cube enables Spatial OnLine Analytical Processing
    (SOLAP). Neves et al. described an architecture in which raw data is stored in
    a datalake. Then, ETLs transforms data to be storable in a database. The data
    is enriched thanks to a knowledge base and its exploration by data mining algorithms
    (machine learning). The result of processing is filtered to improve the quality
    of structured data (Neves and Cruvinel, 2020). Table 14. Table 14. Pros and Cons
    of Datalake/DataHouse. Pros Cons - Store the data in its raw form without transforming
    them immediately. - Availability of results depend of the ingesting speed by processing
    services. - Allow store massive low-value data without investing energy to transform
    and store them in a database. - Data analysis by sampling does not give exact
    results but is estimated. - Provides a solution to situations where the volume
    of data is so large that it can no longer be processed immediately - Data House
    may be limited by the services offered by cloud providers for data analysis. Osmotic
    Computing (OC) (Villari et al., 2016) is a new paradigm inspired by the chemical
    osmosis process that corresponds to a dynamic and bidirectional flow of microservices
    between cloud and edge. OC exploits container-based solution to allows an automatic
    deployment of portable, mobile, and cross-platform microservices between Edge
    and cloud levels (Villari et al., 2016). Osmotic computing introduces the concept
    of Micro Elements (MELS) which decouples user data and applications in Micro Services
    (MS) i.e. a docker container and Micro Data (MD) i.e. an entity self-explicative
    in JSON. MS associates one operating system (Micro Operation Service) with an
    application (Micro User Service) while MD associates a microservice configuration
    (Micro Operational Data) and User data (Micro User Data). These MELS can be deployed
    on Microcontrollers (MCU) or Multiprocessor (MPU) (Villari et al., 2017). Table
    15. Table 15. Pros and Cons of Osmotic Computing. Pros Cons - Micro Element (microservice  +
    micro dataset) easy to migrate between fog and cloud. - All datasets are not decomposable
    in micro dataset. The bidirectional migration of microservices between Edge and
    Cloud must, on one hand, avoid application breakdown and QoS degradation and on
    the other hand manage them dynamically, in high heterogeneously physical resources
    context, in the function of infrastructure and applications requirements (Villari
    et al., 2016). Carnevale et al. have applied osmotic computing to the Internet
    of Things by means of a distributed multi-agent system. Each agent is self-orchestrated,
    works independently, and manages the workflow as a composition of MELs. It monitors
    the overloading state of microservices by means of response time metric and decides
    to relocate them to another agent based on a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
    or Time Series Analysis (Carnevale et al., 2019). Fig. 8, Fig. 9. Download : Download

    image Fig. 9. Osmotic Computing General Scheme. In an IoT context, OC allows to
    deploy lightweight micro services at edge level while complex micro services are
    deployed at fog/cloud level, and balance load between edge, fog, and cloud. (Maksimović,
    2018). Morshed et al. proposed to use OC to distribute Deep Learning across edge,
    cloud, and mobile edge in a holistic way (Morshed et al., 2017). However, Kaur
    et al. in their Osmotic Computing applications survey have identified the need
    of standardization in terms of infrastructure deployment and micro-services distribution.
    The orchestration is crucial to manage efficient services. Security remains an
    important challenge because the service migration is supported by different layers
    (Kaur et al., 2020). Dew Computing (DC) (Skala et al., 2015) allows to further
    improve response times by pushing from Central cloud to end-users, computing applications,
    data, and low-level services. Client microcomputers are used to store a part of
    the data locally in the background and to limit access to the cloud, reduce network
    dependency and drastically reduce processing cost (Skala et al., 2015). Dew computing
    is the additional piece of cloud computing. It is mainly composed of a wide range
    of heterogeneous devices and varied equipment ranging from smartphones to smart
    sensors (Wang, 2016). DC is highly and effectively capable in terms of scalability
    and ability to perform sophisticated operations and to process numerous applications
    and tools. Additionally, the equipment of DC is ad hoc programmable and self-adaptive.
    They have the qualifications to running the process within another process in
    a distributed way without a focal communication network (Skala et al., 2015).
    Applications running in the on-premises computers provide services to users and/or
    devices independently of the cloud but collaborating with cloud services (Wang,
    2016). DC can provide access web fraction without Internet connection (WiD), Storage
    in dew has a cloud copy (STiD), Local database has a cloud backup (DBiD), Software
    ownership and settings have a cloud copy (SiD), SDK and projects have a cloud
    copy (PiD), On-premises computer settings and data have a cloud copy (IaD), Other
    services (DiD) (Wang, 2016). The Fig. 10 presents the dew computing in the general
    scheme Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing. Table 16. Download : Download high-res image

    Table 16. Pros and Cons of Dew Computing. Pros Cons - Allows access to a local
    copy of data when the connection is unavailable. - Replication of data is bandwidth-consuming.
    - Improve the reliability and the false tolerance. - Difficult to exploit if bandwidth
    is insufficient. Rajakaruna et al. presented a dew architecture based on a drone
    to retrieve and process data, manage WSN, and play the role of dew server. The
    drone communicates with sensors, and actuators with BLE protocol, collect, store
    data, and then when the drone is at the docking station it sends data to the cloud
    (Rajakaruna et al., 2018). Grovers et al. described a reliable and fault-tolerant
    architecture at 4 levels (edge, dew, fog, and cloud) in which sensed data is replicated
    at edge, fog and cloud level in order to take over the application’s control when
    a server is failed. In their architecture, dew servers are closed and linked with
    sensors producing data. The fault tolerance is ensured by mobile agents working
    as a resource exchanging the application and link-state information between us,
    and the network monitoring agent (Grover and Garimella, 2018). The Blockchain
    is a distributed digital ledger of transaction distributed maintained by a network
    of multiple computing nodes. This ledger can be deployed among the IoT nodes network
    (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). In the blockchain, transactions namely blocks are
    managed by a specific software platform ensuring the data transmission, processing
    and storage, and its representation in a human-readable form allowing a consistent
    view and a consensus between the participants (Kamilaris et al., 2019). Different
    mechanisms of consensus whose two main ones are the “Proof of Work (PoW)” and
    the Proof of Stake (PoS). The PoW requires the solving of difficult computational
    tasks before validating transactions and the adding of the block in the blockchain.
    In this approach “miners” are in competition to be the first and obtain the rewards,
    which has an impact on the environment, need expending large a amount of computer
    and energy, and involves a risk of centralization. While the PoS approach, “validators”
    are randomly selected with a probability which depends on the amount of stake
    held. At the end of the validation process, it earns a fee. Other less used consensus
    mechanisms exist such as (1) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) in which each node generates
    a random wait time and goes to sleep for that specified duration; (2) Simplified
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), an improvement of Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance (PBFT) specifically designed for blockchain in which each new block
    is maintained by a delegation of nodes with increasing authority. Each one uses
    the internal time to decide when actions must be done; (3) Proof of Authority
    (PoA) in which approved accounts process to the automated validation of transaction
    and blocks. Table 17. Table 17. Pros and Cons of Blockchain. Pros Cons - Data
    distributed (Alonso et al., 2020). - Energy consumption for the complex signature
    verification process can be important. - Immutable, durable, verifiable, secure,
    and transparent (Alonso et al., 2020). - Not adapted to store images, video. -

    Fig. 11. Blockchain General Scheme. The block chain is mainly used in Agriculture
    to make the data of the supply chain transparent and open (Bermeo-Almeida et al.,
    2018) and ensure the complete traceability of the food chain from the fork to
    the plate. The block chain allows to record information about: (1) Transactions
    between provider and farmer as well as information relating to the crops, material
    and chemical products; (2) The farm, cultivation practices and management, animals
    feeding, and complementary information such as weather conditions, animals welfare,
    diseases, treatment, etc; (3) Information about factory and its equipment, the
    processing method, batch numbers but also financial transactions with producers
    and distributors; (4) Warehousing, storage conditions (temperature, humidity),
    methods of transport, transit time, and all financial transactions between the
    distributors and retailers; (5) food items information such as quantity available,
    quality, expiration date, time spent on the shelf or in the stock (Bermeo-Almeida
    et al., 2018, Kamilaris et al., 2019). The Fig. 12 shows an example of blockchain
    applied to an agri supply chain. Download : Download high-res image (112KB) Download

    extent, secured data storage, remote monitoring, and automation. The blockchain
    address some challenges of IoT such as decentralization, data anonymization, and
    security. Moreover, it allows faster and efficient operations, to improve reliability
    and scalability (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). The analysis of new trends shows
    that: (1) Micro service architecture allows decomposing monoliths in microservices
    lowly coupled which makes it easier to maintain it while allowing other services
    to continue operating. Furthermore, this type of architecture is more resilient
    because if one of the services is down, the other services due to the weak coupling
    can continue to operate at least in a degraded mode. (2) Data Lake/DataHouse propose
    a new approach Load Transform Extract (LTE) where data are firstly stored in their
    original format, which are then transformed in order to extract information. This
    paradigm is particularly well adapted when the amount of data is so important
    that process all data is too costly. In this case, data can be sampled in order
    to obtain information. This paradigm is also well adapted if we want to conserve
    also raw data or complete a generic architecture, for example, to store data that
    will be processed in batch processing. (3) Osmotic Computing attempts to propose
    a solution to the repartition of workload between fog and cloud in decomposing
    treatments in microelements composed of a microservice associated with a micro
    dataset. The osmotic computing could also be associated with the micro service
    architecture to allow the distribution of instances of microservices at different
    levels of the network according to their respective load. (4) Dew Computing aims
    to replicate data near sensors or users to continue to store data or allows to
    continue to consult data when connection is intermittent. It allows improving
    the reliance of architectures on connection interruptions. (5) Blockchain provides
    an answer to authentication and security problems by making it possible in particular
    to verify that the data has not been altered or compromised. Nevertheless, it
    is not possible to store large amount of data such as high definitions images,
    or videos in the blockchain but hashes of datasets allowing to verify their authenticity
    well. 6. Towards Agriculture 5.0 According Myklevy et al., the world must improve
    the amount of food produced by 70% by 2050 to produce global food needs for a
    population (Mykleby et al., 2016) of 9.7 billion according to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Zhang, 2016). To overcome these problems
    and contribute to achieve the second objective of 17 Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) with a timeframe in the range 2015 to 2030,
    the concept of Agriculture 5.0 has been born (Martos et al., 2021). Agriculture
    5.0 aims to increase production sustainably while consuming fewer resources and
    taking care of the environment. This next wave of agricultural revolution will
    imply the use of robots integrating machine learning to compensate for the shortage
    of workers. Farm robots are drastically increasing productivity in improving the
    human labor workforce and can also harvest a more important volume faster than
    a human. Nevertheless, these early technologies are still too expensive for most
    farmers especially small farms (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más, 2020). Fig. 13 show
    the coupling between Agriculture 4.0 and Agriculture 5.0 and their integration
    in the context of the agri-food supply chain, the Society 5.0 and 17 Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations (See Fig. 13). Download : Download

    of the Agriculture 5.0 in the context of the Society 5.0. 7. Conclusion Our review
    is boosted by four research questions dectitaed as follow: (1) Which storage and
    processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address
    its particularities? (2) Can generic architectures meet the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that
    allow the transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical
    valuation possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded
    or autonomous products?. The analysis of the literature shows that a multitude
    of architecture coexists. Nevertheless, the Lambada and Kappa architectures seem
    to emerge as generic architectures. These must generally be accompanied by complementary
    architectural components to address specific needs and be part of a storage and
    processing strategy in which the cloud architecture is a component of the chain
    or may also and more rarely be absent. The traditional centralized cloud computing
    will continue to remain an important part of computing systems (Ai et al., 2018),
    for sciences even if other paradigms appear. Indeed, cloud, fog, and edge computing
    complementary interact with each other to form a mutually beneficial and interdependent
    service continuum. Some functions are naturally more suitable or advantageous
    at a level than another in function of requirements in response time, computing,
    or latency tolerance. However, the cloud cannot be completely replaced by fog
    and edge computing because some computation-intensive tasks can only be processed
    at the cloud level, which has the computing power and storage capacities (Wang
    et al., 2020). In Agriculture 4.0, this is particularly the case for the processing
    of satellite images, the training of artificial intelligence algorithms such as
    Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). New trends make it possible to address
    various problems: (1) The Data lake/Data House offers a more economical alternative
    to massive cloud storage in databases. In this paradigm, all data are stored in
    a state and transform only when they are to be exploited. This approach is particularly
    interesting on one hand when all data are not exploited and on the other hand
    when a decision or an action is not expected immediately. Data lake also allows
    the fusion of agriculture data from various origins in different formats and granularity.
    (2) The blockchain provides solutions in particular to the security problems,
    the possibility of distributing data storage and ensuring the traceability of
    transactions in agrifood supply chains (3) As the literature has shown, Dew Computing
    can be placed in two different places in the network either as close as possible
    to the sensors to allow processing to continue during transmission interruptions
    or as close as possible to users in order to have a local copy of the data in
    order to be able to consult them offline. It should be noted, however, that for
    the second option, there are other means of local caching at the device level,
    for amounts of data of a few mega as those offered by Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
    by example. (4) Osmotic computing provides a solution to the question of how to
    distribute the load between the different processing levels (edge, fog, cloud).
    It uses the concept of microelement associating a microservice and its micro dataset.
    In addition, osmotic computing can also be associated with micro-service architectures.
    (5) The microservice architecture offers the possibility of decoupling the monolithic
    architectures into weakly coupled microservices. These services can be more easily
    associated, maintained, or evolved independently. The combination of these microservices
    makes it easier to develop new services for the end-user that are also easier
    and faster to evolve according to technological developments and needs. In addition,
    at the network level, the 5G network offers new possibilities in terms of Wireless
    Sensors and Actuators Network (WSAN), communication between machines, UAVs, and
    UGVs. Moreover, the coupling with MEC opens the field of processing close of end-users.
    The SDN/NFV Architecture allows to facilitate the design, and to improve the flexibility
    of network. Software-defined networking (SDN) allows decoupling transmission of
    data and network control functionality while Network function virtualization (NFV)
    abstracts transfer network and related network functions (Friha et al., 2021).
    Two trends in the use of processing architecture coexist, on the one hand, users
    of a paid or open source IoT platform, and on the other hand, users who develop
    specific architectures to implement particular use cases. From the point of view
    of transferability, we understand that it is easier for ready-made chargeable
    infrastructures and that it can be limited for turnkey open-source infrastructures
    where the type of license adopted may pose a problem. However, the sustainability
    of paid infrastructure is conditional on the development granted by the company
    that manages them and on its financial health. The development of architecture
    based on paid software bricks is facilitated but its durability is conditioned
    by the availability and the maintenance of these software bricks. As for transferability,
    it is linked to the acquisition of ad hoc licenses. The development of architecture
    using open source software bricks from foundations such as Apache Foundation makes
    it possible not to be limited by licenses but is dependent on developments and
    maintenance carried out by the community of developers. These software bricks
    can be abandoned by the community, the company that sponsors them, or the foundation
    that hosts them. The development of a sustainable architecture would go through
    an emancipation of software bricks which would make it possible to easily change
    them on the one hand when one of them disappears or if a new more efficient software
    brick appears. The deployment of 5G and satellite Internet will bring in a new
    player, which are the telecommunications companies that will be able to provide
    processing capacities and services as close as possible to users at the level
    of 5G antennas, which will impact processing architectures. The problem will then
    arise of interoperability between the networks of sensors and actuators with these
    new high-speed, low-latency networks. The new networks offered by the telecommunications
    companies will make it possible to offer new services or even to decouple the
    software from the hardware, which will make it possible to make the sensors and
    actuators interchangeable. This should make it possible to reduce the cost of
    the equipment and make it accessible to developing countries or areas not covered
    by traditional LPWAN and 3GPP networks. The impact of these new networks will
    have to be reviewed in the future to identify the new trends offered by 5G and
    satellite Internet. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    \ attention to digital solutions\nand brought immense demand to the telecommunications\
    \ market. The convergence of 5G\ntechnology and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]\
    \ is the next natural step for two advanced\ntechnologies developed to make the\
    \ lives of their users more accessible, more comfortable,\nand more productive\
    \ [2]. One of the most standard technologies to be brought into the\nmainstream\
    \ area is 5G, which will allow for new business opportunities by being comple-\n\
    mented with Industry 4.0, IoT devices, and Smart Cities and improve overall connectivity\n\
    around the globe [3]. The Internet of Things is an ecosystem of increasing complexity:\
    \ a\nuniverse of connected things capable of capturing critical data and carrying\
    \ out advanced\nanalysis using cloud-based functionalities to extract valuable\
    \ information. This technology\nposes a great opportunity for a multitude of actors\
    \ in all sectors of activity [4]. Many\ncompanies are organizing to focus on IoT\
    \ and connectivity when developing their products\nand services of the future.\n\
    Deployment costs, range, interference, and capabilities of Internet of Things\
    \ devices\nare all factors in identifying the right primary or complementary connectivity\
    \ option for\nan IoT deployment. Wi-Fi 6 or Zigbee is adequate for some elements\
    \ of smart building\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23083876\n\

    \ but useless for highly mobile wide-area use [5]. Additionally, endpoints such\
    \ as\nBluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, or Wi-Fi can be signiﬁcantly more cost effective\
    \ in scenarios where\n5G may be available but has not yet reached a signiﬁcant\
    \ market scale to do competitive\nendpoints or network services [6]. Technical\
    \ studies [7] show that 5G and other services can\ncoexist in speciﬁc frequency\
    \ bands. The technical conditions must be adequately adapted\nand not excessively\
    \ restrictive; otherwise, there is a risk of affecting the costs, coverage,\n\
    and quality of operation of 5G services.\nThere is great interest in the new applications\
    \ of mobile technology merging 5G and\nthe Internet of Things technologies. In\
    \ the design of new applications or technological\naccessories using 5G and the\
    \ Internet of Things, compliance with the permitted exposure\nlimits are contemplated.\
    \ International exposure guidelines have been developed due to\nextensive research\
    \ carried out over many decades. All the analyses carried out by indepen-\ndent\
    \ public health authorities, expert groups, and the World Health Organization\
    \ (WHO)\nagree that these guidelines guarantee protection for all people against\
    \ any health danger [8].\nAs with all technological generations, 5G dramatically\
    \ improves energy efﬁciency depart-\nment and speed rates. However, this technology\
    \ has recently been in the public eye for its\nimplementation challenges.\nIoT\
    \ technologies are now being widely used in the consumer-grade market, primarily\n\
    targeted toward home automation and security. This rise in consumer adoption has\
    \ led to\nproposals to incorporate IoT devices to bring these types of improvements\
    \ to a metropolitan\nscale [9]. These improvements are speculated to improve security\
    \ and automation tasks\nand tackle long-lasting difﬁculties such as trafﬁc control,\
    \ waste management, and so on.\nHowever, IoT does not depend solely on the electronics\
    \ being deployed and installed;\nthey rely on efﬁcient and resilient transmission\
    \ technology being used. The convergence\nof networks and services is an essential\
    \ aspect of the modern internet. The internet has\nevolved from a simple means\
    \ of communication to a complex and multifaceted ecosystem\nthat is integrated\
    \ into nearly every aspect of our daily lives. The advent of 5G technology\nhas\
    \ further pushed the convergence of networks and services, providing users with\
    \ faster\nand more reliable internet connections, enabling a range of new and\
    \ innovative applications\nand services [10].\nOne of the most signiﬁcant ways\
    \ that the convergence of networks and services\nimpacts internet services is\
    \ by increasing the availability and speed of access to the internet.\n5G technology\
    \ offers faster speeds and greater bandwidth, allowing users to access high-\n\
    quality video, audio, and other media content in real-time [11]. This means that\
    \ internet\nservice providers can offer a range of new services and applications\
    \ that were previously\nimpossible, such as virtual and augmented reality experiences\
    \ and immersive gaming.\nCellular connectivity will enable key IoT goals to be\
    \ achieved, in particular, reduced\ndevice complexity and cost and increased coverage\
    \ to support challenging and remote\napplications, deployment ﬂexibility, high\
    \ capacity, and long battery life. 3GPP wireless\ntechnologies offer compelling\
    \ technology advantages that will continue to increase the\ncapacity of Long Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) infrastructure to address the vast IoT market in\nthe long term,\
    \ and 5G will add to the IoT landscape soon. In Releases 14, 15, and beyond\n\
    of the 3GPP (Third-Generation Partnership Project), the standards solve all commercial\n\
    bottlenecks to facilitate the vision of 5G and the huge IoT Market [12]. This\
    \ can lead\nto the explosion of billions of devices and sensors that show digital\
    \ representations of\nour real world powered by low-cost devices, long battery\
    \ life, ubiquitous coverage, and\ninnovative business applications. 5G promises\
    \ that it will be possible to achieve critical\nIoT applications, which require\
    \ real-time dynamic process control and automation in\nvarious ﬁelds, such as\
    \ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), high-speed\nmotion,\
    \ and trafﬁc control. Critical parameters to enable the required performance are\n\
    sub-millisecond network latency and ultra-high reliability. Both are intrinsic\
    \ components of\nthe 3GPP work to deﬁne the new radio interface for 5G [13]. The\
    \ 5G network architecture\nis being designed to address both IoT scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n3 of 41\nThe success of the IoT services on 5G networks\
    \ depends on the ability of these networks\nto manage interference effectively.\
    \ Interference can occur when different IoT devices operate\nin the same area,\
    \ and their signals overlap, causing lower throughput, higher latency, and\ndecreased\
    \ reliability [14]. This is a signiﬁcant challenge for 5G networks and IoT services,\
    \ as\nthey are designed to support a vast number of devices and applications,\
    \ each with unique\nconnectivity and latency requirements.\nFigure 1 shows the\
    \ comparison between 5G and IoT, which is a topic of interest\nin the technology\
    \ world. To implement 5G, there are speciﬁc requirements, including\ninfrastructure\
    \ and specialized hardware, while the evolution of wireless networks has led to\n\
    faster and more reliable data transfer rates. The evolution of IoT has enabled\
    \ the creation of\nlow-power, low-cost devices that can be connected to the internet.\
    \ Wireless communication\ntechnologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRa\
    \ are suitable for different types of\nIoT applications, and cloud-based solutions\
    \ are used to store and process vast amounts\nof data generated by IoT devices.\
    \ 5G applications include autonomous vehicles, remote\nsurgery, and virtual and\
    \ augmented reality, and these require high bandwidth, low latency,\nand reliable\
    \ connectivity. However, there are challenges associated with 5G networks,\nsuch\
    \ as interference and network optimization difﬁculties. The coexistence of 5G\
    \ networks\nand IoT applications is a concern, and optimization challenges in\
    \ 5G networks need to be\naddressed to enable efﬁcient and effective implementation.\n\
    Figure 1. Summary of conceptual schemes that addresses the present work.\nMotivation\n\
    The motivation of this work is to compile the impact of interference on the leading\
    \ 5G\ntechnologies that will inﬂuence the communications of IoT devices.\nIoT\
    \ services are used in various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing,\n\
    and transportation, where reliable and efﬁcient connectivity is essential for\
    \ the proper\nfunctioning of IoT devices and the smooth operation of business\
    \ processes. If interference\nand network performance issues are not addressed,\
    \ businesses may experience reduced\nproductivity, increased downtime, and decreased\
    \ customer satisfaction. Consequently,\naddressing the interference and optimization\
    \ of 5G networks in IoT services is essential to\nensure reliable and efﬁcient\
    \ connectivity for IoT devices and allow businesses to take full\nadvantage of\
    \ the beneﬁts of 5G networks and IoT services. For this reason, the motivation\n\
    of this work is to review the state of the art of the work to address the interference\
    \ and\noptimization of 5G technologies in IoT services.\nInterference and optimization\

    \ management techniques and\noptimizing network performance, businesses can take\
    \ full advantage of the beneﬁts of 5G\nnetworks and IoT services.\nThe main contribution\
    \ of this review is to present the idea that the convergence\nof 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services represents a technological revolution that promises to\nchange\
    \ how we interact with the world around us. However, this union has its challenges,\n\
    and only by overcoming them can we unlock the full potential of these groundbreaking\n\
    technologies. By bridging the gap between 5G and IoT, we pave the way for a new\
    \ era\nof innovation: every device is connected, and every experience is seamless.\
    \ This work\ndescribes the main challenges between 5G networks and IoT services\
    \ and highlights the\nneed for seamless integration of these technologies to achieve\
    \ their full potential. This\npaper reinforces the idea that IoT technologies\
    \ power 5G services, and their compatibility\nis crucial for offering high-speed\
    \ and low-latency services to consumers. Furthermore, it\nunderscores that interference\
    \ is one of the biggest problems facing manufacturers, and they\nmust consider\
    \ it to offer compatible and reliable services. Ultimately, this article guides\n\
    the industry to ensure that 5G and IoT technologies work together seamlessly,\
    \ opening up\nendless possibilities for innovation and progress.\nFigure 2 describes\
    \ how the IoT and 5G technology can work together to enable a range\nof applications\
    \ in different ﬁelds. In the ﬁrst application, smart cities, IoT devices can\n\
    be used to collect real-time data on trafﬁc patterns, air quality, and energy\
    \ usage. These\ndata can be used to optimize city operations and improve quality\
    \ of life. 5G networks\ncan support these applications by providing the necessary\
    \ bandwidth and low latency.\nIn industrial automation, IoT devices can be used\
    \ to monitor and control manufacturing\nprocesses and equipment in real time.\
    \ This can help to improve efﬁciency and reduce\ndowntime. 5G networks can provide\
    \ the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and low latency\nto support these applications.\
    \ In healthcare, IoT devices can be used for remote patient\nmonitoring and real-time\
    \ communication between healthcare providers. This can help\nto improve patient\
    \ outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. 5G networks can provide\nthe necessary\
    \ bandwidth, low latency, and reliability to support these applications. In\n\
    transportation, IoT devices can provide real-time data on trafﬁc patterns and\
    \ vehicle\nperformance, which can be used to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow and improve safety.\
    \ 5G networks\ncan support these applications by providing the necessary bandwidth,\
    \ low latency, and\nreliability. In agriculture, IoT devices can be used to monitor\
    \ crops and livestock in real-time,\nwhich can help to optimize production and\
    \ reduce waste. 5G networks can support these\napplications by providing the necessary\
    \ bandwidth, reliability, and low latency. In retail,\nIoT devices can be used\
    \ to collect real-time data on customer behavior and inventory levels,\nwhich\
    \ can be used to optimize store operations and improve the customer experience.\
    \ 5G\nnetworks can provide the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and low latency\

    \ Work\nThe radio signal characteristics of new wireless applications are similar\
    \ to those of\nexisting mobile technologies [5]. This is where the interest of\
    \ this work lies in considering in\ndetail the impact and types of interference\
    \ of 5G technologies that coexist with IoT devices.\nThe new applications use\
    \ similar transmit powers and operate in the same frequency ranges.\nTo mitigate\
    \ interference, we can synchronize or coordinate all networks or implement\nlarge\
    \ guard bands that waste valuable spectrum [15]. In practice, close cooperation\
    \ is\nrequired between all operators in each frequency band, and not all usage\
    \ modes and\nall types of 5G deployments can likely be supported simultaneously.\
    \ Regulators need\nto consider these technical issues and their implications when\
    \ deciding how to arrange\nfrequencies in these bands.\nVarious interference management\
    \ techniques, such as power control, channel allo-\ncation, and beamforming, can\
    \ be implemented to ensure that IoT devices on the same\nnetwork do not interfere\
    \ with each other. However, these techniques can be complicated\nand may require\
    \ signiﬁcant changes to the network infrastructure [16]. Additionally, new\ninterference\
    \ management techniques may be required as IoT devices continue to evolve\nand\
    \ become more sophisticated.\nAnother signiﬁcant challenge in managing interference\
    \ in 5G networks is the diversity\nof devices and applications that use these\
    \ networks. IoT services can be used in various\nindustries, including healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, and transportation, each with unique\nconnectivity and latency\
    \ requirements [17]. For instance, in healthcare, IoT devices, such as\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n6 of 41\nwearable monitors and remote patient monitoring systems,\
    \ require low latency and reliable\nconnectivity to provide accurate data and\
    \ alerts. In contrast, IoT devices used in industrial\nautomation require high\
    \ bandwidth and low latency to operate effectively [18]. Therefore,\nmanaging\
    \ interference in 5G networks requires a comprehensive approach that considers\n\
    the diverse connectivity and latency requirements of different IoT devices and\
    \ applications.\nAnother important challenge is the potential for external interference;\
    \ while interfer-\nence management techniques can ensure that IoT devices on the\
    \ same network do not\ninterfere with each other, external interference can occur\
    \ when IoT devices operate in areas\nwith other wireless devices, such as Wi-Fi\
    \ routers, Bluetooth devices, and other cellular\nnetworks. This can lead to signal\
    \ degradation, reduced throughput, and decreased reliabil-\nity of the network\
    \ [19]. As a result, it is essential to consider external interference when\n\
    designing and implementing 5G networks for IoT services, and to use techniques\
    \ such as\nfrequency coordination and spectrum sharing to manage external interference\
    \ effectively.\nTo provide better insights for the 5G interference topic, we follow\
    \ the structure detailed\nin Figure 3.\nFigure 3. 5G and IoT technologies’ impact\
    \ scheme.\nThe impact of 5G network interference on IoT services is an active\
    \ research area. Sev-\neral studies have investigated the effects of interference\
    \ on the performance of IoT devices\nand applications. One recent study by Chandra\
    \ et al. analyzed the impact of interference\non the reliability of 5G networks\
    \ for IoT services [20]. The study found that interference\ncan signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ the reliability of 5G networks for IoT services, especially in dense\ndeployments\
    \ where multiple devices operate in the same area. The study recommended\nusing\
    \ advanced interference management techniques such as dynamic channel allocation\n\
    and power control to mitigate interference effects and improve network reliability.\n\
    Another recent study by Azari et al. [21] investigated the impact of interference\
    \ on\nthe performance of 5G networks for IoT applications. The study found that\
    \ interference\ncan cause signiﬁcant degradation of network performance, especially\
    \ for applications\nthat require low latency and high bandwidth. The study recommended\
    \ using adaptive\nbeamforming and dynamic channel allocation to reduce interference\
    \ and improve the\nperformance of 5G networks for IoT applications. Additionally,\
    \ the study highlighted\nthe need for more research into interference management\
    \ techniques that can effectively\nmitigate the impact of interference on 5G networks\
    \ for IoT services.\nSeveral research studies have also investigated the impact\
    \ of interference on the\nenergy consumption of IoT devices connected to 5G networks.\
    \ One recent study by\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n7 of 41\nAl-Turjman et al. [22]\
    \ found that interference can cause IoT devices to consume more energy\nto maintain\
    \ connectivity, leading to reduced battery life and increased maintenance costs.\n\
    The study recommended the use of interference management techniques, such as energy-\n\
    efﬁcient channel allocation and scheduling to reduce interference and improve\
    \ the energy\nefﬁciency of IoT devices on 5G networks. The study concluded that\
    \ effective interference\nmanagement techniques are crucial for ensuring the sustainability\
    \ and economic viability\nof IoT services on 5G networks.\nAnother critical area\
    \ of research related to 5G network interference in IoT services is\nthe security\
    \ and privacy implications of interference management techniques. Interference\n\
    management techniques, such as beamforming and channel allocation, require the\
    \ ex-\nchange of information between IoT devices and the network, which can potentially\
    \ expose\nsensitive information to eavesdroppers and attackers. A recent study\
    \ by Hasan et al. [23]\ninvestigated the security and privacy risks associated\
    \ with beamforming and proposed a\nsecure beamforming scheme that uses encryption\
    \ and authentication to protect sensitive\ninformation. The study concluded that\
    \ the security and privacy implications of interference\nmanagement techniques\
    \ must be carefully considered when designing 5G networks for\nIoT services. Effective\
    \ security and privacy measures can help mitigate the risks associated\nwith interference\
    \ management techniques and ensure the integrity and conﬁdentiality of\nIoT data\
    \ on 5G networks.\nOverall, the current state of the art and related work on the\
    \ impact of 5G network\ninterference on IoT services highlight the importance\
    \ of effective interference management\ntechniques to ensure the reliability and\
    \ performance of 5G networks for IoT applications.\nThe studies recommend the\
    \ use of advanced interference management techniques, such as\ndynamic channel\
    \ allocation, power control, adaptive beamforming, and spectrum sharing,\nto mitigate\
    \ the effects of interference and improve network performance. However, more\n\
    research is needed to develop new and more effective interference management techniques\n\
    that can address the unique challenges of 5G networks and IoT services.\nTable\

    \ operate: This metric indicates whether the IoT service can operate\nwith multiple\
    \ devices. This is an important factor to consider since many IoT services\ninvolve\
    \ the connection of multiple devices, and the network needs to support the\nsimultaneous\
    \ communication of these devices.\n4.\nLatency: This parameter measures the amount\
    \ of delay or lag time in transmitting data\nbetween the IoT devices and the network.\

    \ as connected vehicles and healthcare monitoring. The\nvalues in this column\
    \ range from low to ultra-low.\n5.\nInterference management techniques: This parameter\
    \ lists the various techniques that\ncan be used to manage interference in the\

    \ power control, interference avoidance, MIMO (multiple-input,\nmultiple-output)\
    \ [24], cognitive radio, massive MIMO, and interference alignment.\n6.\nEnergy\
    \ consumption: This metric indicates the amount of energy consumed by the\nIoT\
    \ devices and the network. Energy consumption is an important consideration for\n\
    IoT services, especially for those that operate in remote locations or rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered devices. The values in this column range from low to high.\n\

    Medium\n3. Materials and Methods\n4G networks are based on LTE technology, which\
    \ uses a frequency spectrum of around\n700 MHz to 2600 MHz. These frequencies\
    \ are divided into different bands that are used for\ndifferent purposes, such\
    \ as voice and data communication. 4G networks use a combination\nof Frequency\
    \ Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) techniques to\ntransmit\
    \ and receive data. FDD uses separate frequencies for transmitting and receiving\n\
    data, while TDD uses the same frequency for both.\nOn the other hand, IoT devices\
    \ use a variety of technologies and protocols to com-\nmunicate with each other\
    \ and with the internet. These devices can operate on different\nfrequency bands,\
    \ such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and sub-GHz bands. Some IoT devices use the\nunlicensed\
    \ spectrum, which means they can operate on any frequency without needing a\n\
    license, while others use the licensed spectrum, which requires a license from\
    \ the relevant\nregulatory body.\nOne of the main issues with 4G services and\
    \ networks is that they can cause inter-\nference with IoT devices, especially\
    \ those operating on the same frequency bands. This\ninterference can cause communication\
    \ problems and even lead to data loss or corruption.\nTo mitigate this interference,\
    \ different methods can be used, such as frequency hopping,\nspread-spectrum techniques,\
    \ and power control.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n9 of 41\nFigure 4 summarizes this\
    \ section, where the main concepts related to the impact of\n5G networks on IoT\
    \ services are observed. We analyze the implementation, the evolution,\nand the\
    \ types of wireless technologies that inﬂuence current services, the leading 5G\n\
    technologies and problems, and the coexistence of next-generation networks. We\
    \ frame\ninterference as the heart of the study of problems in this type of network.\n\
    Figure 4. Materials and Methods for 5G and IoT services.\n3.1. 5G Implementation\
    \ Requirements\n5G is an emerging technology in the telecommunications area. Enabling\
    \ high-speed\nconnections, offering lower latencies, and ensuring highly scalable\
    \ connectivity between mul-\ntiple devices [34], every industry worldwide eagerly\
    \ waits for mainstream implementation.\n5G allows for several technologies related\
    \ to massive machine-to-machine communi-\ncations, or IoT, to improve and offer\
    \ high-speed connectivity between devices, primarily\nallowing automation in the\
    \ manufacturing and construction industries. However, IoT has\nseen massive consumer\
    \ implementation in homes, malls, and parks, which means this\ntechnology has\
    \ several use cases for ordinary daily consumers.\nOn the technical side of 5G,\
    \ it works on a higher spectrum range when compared to\ntraditional wireless technologies.\
    \ Ranging from 24 to 100 GHz, it provides low-latency\ncommunication and high\
    \ throughput rates but suffers from adverse conditions caused\nby its high-frequency\
    \ nature [35]. 5G also operates on two frequency bands: Sub 6 GHz\nand mmWave\
    \ (millimeter wave). While mmWave offers faster data transfer rates, it has\n\
    limited coverage and is easily obstructed. On the other hand, the Sub 6 GHz band,\
    \ which\nincludes frequencies below 6 GHz, offers wider coverage and can penetrate\
    \ obstacles such\nas buildings and walls [36]. This means that 5G can actually\
    \ work in the Sub 6 GHz band,\nproviding a more reliable and accessible network\
    \ for users. This is particularly important\nfor rural and suburban areas where\
    \ building penetration is critical, and for indoor usage\nwhere higher frequency\
    \ bands may not be able to reach. Therefore, despite the hype around\nmmWave,\
    \ the Sub 6 GHz band remains a vital part of the 5G network, providing a strong\n\
    foundation for the future of wireless technology.\nTo counteract the limitations,\
    \ 5G has been complemented with new technologies. The\nmost common ones are beamforming,\
    \ massive MIMO, small cell, mmWave, and network\nslicing, and new proposals arise\
    \ everyday to try and get the most out of this generation.\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3876\n10 of 41\nEven though 5G is far from being implemented worldwide, several\
    \ service providers\nhave been publicly working and sharing their advances related\
    \ to this technology. Some\nfamous names from the IT world are Ericsson, Verizon,\
    \ Nokia, AT&T, T-Mobile, Samsung,\nand Qualcomm. However, undoubtedly, most big\
    \ telecommunications companies are\nworking on projects related to the new generation\
    \ of wireless technologies.\nResearch groups have been focused on the 5G mobile\
    \ network ecosystem, with institu-\ntions such as METIS (Mobile and wireless communications\
    \ Enablers for Twenty-twenty\n(2020) Information Society), 5G PPP (5G Infrastructure\
    \ Public Private Partnership), and\nNYU New York University Wireless, conducting\
    \ impactful research related to MIMO\ntransmissions, millimeter waves, and frameworks\
    \ in the 5G ecosystem [37].\n5G networks offer several features that are essential\
    \ for the Internet of Things (IoT)\nservices, as Figure 5 shows. 5G provides increased\
    \ bandwidth and lower latency, allowing\nIoT devices to transmit data quickly\
    \ and efﬁciently for real-time communication and\nresponse. 5G enables massive\
    \ machine-type communication (mMTC), which allows a\nlarge number of IoT devices\
    \ to connect to the network simultaneously. Ultra-reliable and\nlow-latency communication\
    \ (URLLC) is also provided, ensuring quick and reliable data\ntransmission suitable\
    \ for mission-critical IoT services. Network slicing is another feature of\n5G\
    \ networks, which creates dedicated virtual networks for IoT devices to provide\
    \ better\nnetwork performance and security.\nFigure 5. 5G features that are essential\
    \ for the Internet of Things services.\nBefore the implementation of 5G networks,\
    \ organizations such as IEEE needed to\ncope with challenges about the implementation\
    \ of 5G. One of these challenges is about the\ndata rate key dimensions, since\
    \ the demand of technology services are increasing in the\npast years. 5G should\
    \ be a solution in order to satisfy all this demand and provide a great\nQuality\
    \ of Service (QoS) [38].\nAnother factor to consider is the latency, which is\
    \ responsible for the delay in incoming\nand outgoing packages on a link, as streaming\
    \ services such as online games [39], metaverse,\nand more demand a low latency\
    \ in order to provide better services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n11 of 41\nIn modern\
    \ society, most products use electrical power, including, for example, electric\n\
    cars such as Tesla. In other words, we are surrounded by electronic devices, and\
    \ it is\nessential to focus on developing friendly devices to avoid consuming\
    \ too much electricity.\nSome important points about 5G energy consumption need\
    \ to be mentioned. First, energy\nefﬁciency depends on the trafﬁc in the network.\
    \ According to the article “Energy-efﬁcient\n5G for a greener future” [40], when\
    \ the trafﬁc load is low, a base station can save 98.75% of\npower, but if the\
    \ trafﬁc load is high, the power consumption may increase.\nFigure 6 describes\
    \ the requirements for 5G. This generation is the latest generation\nof cellular\
    \ networks that is designed to offer signiﬁcant improvements in performance,\n\
    capacity, and ﬂexibility compared to previous generations. To achieve these improvements,\n\
    5G networks utilize several key technologies. One of these technologies is millimeter\n\
    wave (mmWave) frequencies, which are higher frequency bands that can provide higher\n\
    bandwidth and faster data rates. However, these frequencies have short wavelengths\n\
    and require line-of-sight communication between the transmitter and receiver.\
    \ Another\ntechnology used in 5G networks is massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple\
    \ output)\ntechnology, which uses a large number of antennas to increase the number\
    \ of spatial\nstreams and improve the efﬁciency of the wireless channel. This\
    \ can help to increase the\ndata transfer rates and overall network capacity.\
    \ Beamforming is also a key technology used\nin 5G networks, as it uses advanced\
    \ techniques to focus the radio signal towards a speciﬁc\ndevice, increasing the\
    \ signal strength and reducing interference. This technology is crucial\nfor providing\
    \ reliable and high-speed connectivity in a dense and dynamic environment.\nNetwork\
    \ slicing is another feature of 5G networks that allows for the creation of dedicated\n\
    virtual networks to meet the speciﬁc requirements of different applications. This\
    \ means that\ndevices can allocated their own network resources and services,\
    \ providing better network\nperformance and security. Edge computing is also used\
    \ in 5G networks, which provides real-\ntime processing and analysis of data at\
    \ the edge of the network. This can help to reduce the\nlatency and improve the\
    \ performance of time-sensitive applications, such as autonomous\nvehicles and\
    \ virtual reality. Low latency is another feature of 5G networks that is important\n\
    for applications that require real-time communication and response, such as autonomous\n\
    vehicles and remote surgery. 5G networks aim to achieve a latency of less than\
    \ 1 millisecond.\nHigh reliability is also a critical feature of 5G networks,\
    \ with features such as network slicing\nand redundant network paths, ensuring\
    \ that devices stay connected. This is essential for\nmission-critical applications\
    \ that require high availability and low downtime. 5G networks\nsupport full duplex\
    \ communication, which allows for simultaneous transmission and\nreception of\
    \ data. This technology can help to improve the efﬁciency and capacity of the\n\
    network, enabling higher data transfer rates and reducing latency.\nBased on the\
    \ requirements above, the following are the 5G network deployment\nrequirements:\n\
    •\nMillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for higher bandwidth and faster data rates.\n\
    •\nMassive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) technology for increasing spatial\n\
    streams and improving the wireless channel’s efﬁciency.\n•\nBeamforming to focus\
    \ the radio signal towards a speciﬁc device, increasing signal\nstrength and reducing\
    \ interference.\n•\nNetwork slicing for creating dedicated virtual networks to\
    \ meet the speciﬁc require-\nments of different applications, improving network\
    \ performance and security.\n•\nEdge computing for real-time processing and analysis\
    \ of data at the edge of the net-\nwork, reducing latency and improving the performance\
    \ of time-sensitive applications.\n•\nLow latency for real-time communication\
    \ and response, aiming to achieve a latency of\nless than 1 millisecond.\n•\n\
    High reliability for mission-critical applications, ensuring high availability\
    \ and low\ndowntime.\n•\nFull duplex communication for simultaneous transmission\
    \ and reception of data,\nimproving efﬁciency, capacity, and reducing latency.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n12 of 41\nThe combination of these technologies in 5G\
    \ networks can enable a wide range of\napplications, from IoT services to high-bandwidth\
    \ applications, such as virtual reality and\naugmented reality. 5G networks aim\
    \ to provide the necessary performance metrics to\nsupport these applications,\
    \ enabling the growth of the IoT ecosystem and a new era of\nconnectivity.\nFigure\
    \ 6. 5G implementation requirements.\n3.2. Evolution of Wireless Networks\nWireless\
    \ networks [41] have an important role in our society, because they allow us to\n\
    keep connected in a network without cables, being the bridge to create useful\
    \ tools. For\ninstance, 3GPP provides basic data services such as voice and messaging\
    \ capabilities, with\n4G we can make video calls, and use IP services, and with\
    \ 5G we can get more beneﬁts,\nsuch as low latency, more bandwidth, and other\
    \ interesting features [42].\n3.3. Evolution of IoT\nThe evolution of the internet\
    \ allowed remote connections between machines, and\nthe protocol standardization\
    \ used to transmit the information, such as TCP/IP, enabled\nresearchers to take\
    \ advantage of the internet and allowed to creation of new protocols and\nways\
    \ to transmit the data [43]. Since then, new technologies has arrived in our lives,\
    \ which\nis the case of IoT. In the last few years, new technologies and protocols\
    \ arose to connect\nand transmit data between IoT devices and networks, each providing\
    \ speciﬁc features\nto perform the applications. In the following statements,\
    \ we mention some protocols to\ncommunicate data. Each protocol can provide better\
    \ communication depending on the\napplication. For example, LoRaWAN is used in\
    \ long-range communication, allowing to\ntransmit of data through large distances\
    \ even with obstacles between the link and using\nlow power consumption. Zigbee\
    \ is a protocol commonly used in smart homes, avoiding\ninferences by routers,\
    \ electronic devices, and so on.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n13 of 41\nThe evolution\
    \ of IoT technologies is having a signiﬁcant impact on 5G networks. As\nmore and\
    \ more devices are connected to the internet, there is a growing need for faster,\n\
    more reliable connectivity. This is where 5G networks come in, providing higher\
    \ speeds,\nlower latency, and greater capacity than previous wireless technologies.\
    \ The proliferation\nof IoT devices also creates new opportunities for 5G, as\
    \ the technology is able to support the\nmassive amounts of data generated by\
    \ these devices. However, this also poses challenges\nfor 5G networks, such as\
    \ the need to handle large amounts of trafﬁc from a variety of\ndevices with different\
    \ requirements. As a result, the evolution of IoT technologies is\ndriving innovation\
    \ in 5G networks, as providers look for ways to meet the demands of this\ngrowing\
    \ ecosystem.\nThe implementation of 5G networks is expected to have a signiﬁcant\
    \ impact on the\nevolution of IoT services. One of the most signiﬁcant changes\
    \ is the increase in the speed\nof data transfer. 5G networks have much faster\
    \ data transfer speeds, lower latency, and\nhigher capacity than previous generations\
    \ of mobile networks [44]. This means that IoT\ndevices can transmit and receive\
    \ data much more quickly, which enables more real-time\ndata processing and analysis.\
    \ The improved responsiveness of IoT services will open up\nopportunities for\
    \ new applications that require near-instantaneous data processing, such\nas remote\
    \ surgery, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\nAnother important\
    \ change brought about by the implementation of 5G networks is\nthe increased\
    \ scalability of IoT services. 5G networks have a higher device density, which\n\
    means that they can support a greater number of IoT devices per unit area. This\
    \ will help\nto increase the scalability of IoT services and allow for the deployment\
    \ of more complex\nand sophisticated IoT solutions.\nFurthermore, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to improve the reliability of IoT services. 5G\nnetworks have more\
    \ robust error correction capabilities and redundancy features, which\ncan increase\
    \ the reliability of IoT services. This is particularly important for mission-critical\n\
    applications, such as remote monitoring of infrastructure or medical devices [45].\
    \ Improved\nreliability will also be beneﬁcial in industries that require highly\
    \ reliable communication\nnetworks, such as manufacturing and energy.\nThe enhanced\
    \ security features of 5G networks will also impact the evolution of IoT\nservices.\
    \ 5G networks offer improved security features, such as network slicing, which\n\
    allows for the creation of isolated virtual networks for different IoT applications.\
    \ This can\nhelp to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security and privacy\
    \ of IoT data. With\nthe increasing number of IoT devices, the importance of security\
    \ and privacy is critical and\n5G networks can provide a more secure environment\
    \ for the data transmitted.\n5G networks will help to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of IoT devices. 5G networks\nare designed to be more energy efﬁcient than previous\
    \ generations of mobile networks [46].\nThis can help to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of IoT devices, prolonging their battery life\nand reducing their environmental\
    \ impact. This is particularly important for IoT devices\nthat are difﬁcult or\
    \ expensive to replace or recharge, such as sensors deployed in remote\nor inaccessible\
    \ locations. Figure 7 describes the main features related to 5G networks and\n\
    IoT services. The performance metrics associated with energy consumption are mentioned\n\
    here too.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n14 of 41\nFigure 7. Deﬁning 5G and features\
    \ that are essential for the Internet of Things services.\n3.4. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for IoT and Cloud-Based Solutions\nThis section covers various\
    \ wireless communication protocols used in IoT devices,\nincluding Wi-Fi AdHoc,\
    \ Zigbee, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN, and SigFox. It also touches on the\nuse of cloud computing\
    \ for IoT applications, such as data storage, analytics, and remote\ndevice management.\
    \ This section could provide a comprehensive overview of wireless\ncommunication\
    \ technologies used in IoT devices and their integration with cloud-based\nsolutions.\n\
    1.\nWi-Fi AdHoc: With the standard of IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi technology turned into\
    \ the\nﬁrst technology to create devices connected to the network. Allowing to\
    \ create news\narchitectures such as Wi-Fi AdHoc is a decentralized type of wireless\
    \ network because\neach node participates in routing by forwarding data to other\
    \ nodes [47]. These nodes\ncan be IoT devices and are very helpful in applications\
    \ where it is needed to have\nmany devices connected.\n2.\nZigbee: The most popular\
    \ industry wireless mesh networking standard for connecting\nsensors, instrumentation,\
    \ and control systems. Zigbee implements communication in\na personal wireless\
    \ area network, providing low power consumption and interoper-\nating multi-vendor,\
    \ commonly used in home automation, low-power consumption\nsensors, HVAC (Heating,\
    \ Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control, etc. [48].\n3.\nZ-Wave: A wireless\
    \ protocol evolved by Zensys and conﬁrmed by the Z-Wave Alliance\nfor automation\
    \ apparatuses for home and commercial environments. This protocol\nallows transmitting\
    \ short messages with minimum noise and uses a Mesh network\nconﬁguration [49].\n\
    4.\nLoRaWAN: A low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed to connect battery\n\
    wirelessly operated ‘things’ to the internet in regional, national, or global\
    \ networks. It\ntargets IoT requirements, such as bi-directional communication,\
    \ end-to-end security,\nmobility, and localization services. According to work\
    \ cited in [50], LoRa has the most\nfeatures in terms of IoT, such as low power\
    \ consumption, long-range communication,\netc. Furthermore, the paper tested communication\
    \ in urban and forest areas, showing\nthat LoRaWAN can transmit data up to 2.1\
    \ km in urban areas.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n15 of 41\n5.\nSigFox: SigFox is\
    \ a network operator dedicated to the Internet of Things. The SigFox\nnetwork\
    \ uses the ultra-narrow band, allowing devices to communicate with low\npower\
    \ on a wide area [51].\n6.\nCloud Computing: Cloud computing is a term used to\
    \ describe both a platform and a\ntype of application. One of the essential features\
    \ of cloud computing is the capability\nto assign dynamic resources to the network,\
    \ being an important key to providing\nscalable solutions and avoiding high costs.\
    \ The interference plays an important\nrole when connecting devices since the\
    \ signal quality decrease, which means the\nmodulation decreases and the bits\
    \ per error increases. That is a problem if we are\ntrying to offer large bandwidths\
    \ and low latency in each data transmission [52]. We\nmust consider different\
    \ factors to provide a great QoS, like the weather, buildings,\nhardware, software\
    \ resources, etc. In the IoT context, the buildings and distances\ncreate the\
    \ main interferences. For that reason, technologies such as Zigbee, SigFox,\n\
    LoRaWAN, and Z-wave play a vital role in connecting devices.\n7.\nWiGig: WiGig,\
    \ also known as 802.11ay, is a wireless communication technology that\noperates\
    \ on the 60 GHz frequency band [53]. It was developed as an extension of the\n\
    Wi-Fi standard to provide high-speed, short-range wireless communication, primarily\n\
    for applications that require high bandwidth, such as virtual reality, high-deﬁnition\n\
    video streaming, and gaming. WiGig supports multi-gigabit data transfer rates,\
    \ with\ntheoretical speeds of up to 176 Gbps, which is much faster than the previous\
    \ Wi-\nFi standards [54]. It achieves this speed through the use of wider bandwidth\
    \ and\nadvanced modulation techniques, such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation\
    \ (QAM)\nand Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Another notable\
    \ feature\nof WiGig is its low latency, making it ideal for applications that\
    \ require real-time\ndata transfer, such as gaming and virtual reality [55]. It\
    \ also supports multiple-input,\nmultiple-output technology, which enables multiple\
    \ antennas to transmit and receive\ndata simultaneously, improving the overall\
    \ performance and efﬁciency of the network.\nIn the context of 5G networks, WiGig\
    \ can be used as a complementary technology\nto provide high-speed local area\
    \ network (LAN) connections for mobile devices and\nIoT devices. The 60 GHz frequency\
    \ band has a limited range, but it can support high\ndata rates over short distances,\
    \ making it suitable for applications, such as augmented\nand virtual reality\
    \ (AR/VR), wireless HD video streaming, and cloud gaming [56]. In\naddition, WiGig\
    \ can be used as a backhaul technology for small cells in 5G networks,\nenabling\
    \ high-speed data transfers between small cells and the core network. This\ncan\
    \ help improve the performance and capacity of 5G networks, especially in densely\n\
    populated urban areas where there is high demand for data services. Regarding\
    \ IoT\nservices, WiGig can enable high-speed local area connections between IoT\
    \ devices,\nallowing them to share data quickly and efﬁciently. This can be especially\
    \ useful for\napplications, such as smart homes, where multiple IoT devices need\
    \ to communicate\nwith each other in real time.\n3.5. 5G Applications\n5G beneﬁts\
    \ are not utilized solely by the most prominent IT corporations world-\nwide.\
    \ In the modern era, we have found several exciting applications where 5G’s high\n\
    speeds, excellent reliability, and energy efﬁciency come into play and provide\
    \ a better\nuser experience.\n•\nEntertainment services: Video-on-demand services\
    \ are currently one of the most\nutilized services on the internet. These services\
    \ demand high-speed connections, and\nwith rising trends to utilize higher resolution\
    \ devices, 5G plays a vital role in providing\noptimal user experience so that\
    \ they can consume their content without interruption.\n•\nGeneral mobile networks:\
    \ Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years, teleworking\nhas seen an immense\
    \ rise in all sectors globally. This means workers must be able\nto respond to\
    \ video or voice calls at any given time, requiring improved downlink\nand uplink\
    \ speeds. These requirements, complemented with the higher reliability\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n16 of 41\naspects of 5G, mean that this implementation will\
    \ improve communications in any\ngiven context, especially for work-related tasks.\n\
    •\nInternet of Things: IoT is one of the trendiest topics around the electronics\
    \ ecosys-\ntem, due to its nature to provide automation to simple or very complex\
    \ topics. Even\nthough most IoT devices currently utilize 3G or 4G-LTE technologies\
    \ due to their low\nrequirements for data connectivity, a new generation of IoT\
    \ devices requires higher\nthroughput rates. These requirements are on the limits\
    \ of the current generation of\nwireless technologies, which makes 5G an interesting\
    \ contestant to solve these require-\nments. The most popular IoT applications\
    \ today involve Smart Homes, industries,\nor farming, which generally require\
    \ low amounts of wireless capabilities because\nthe devices have low microprocessing\
    \ power due to the nature of the technology\nitself. However, new trends, such\
    \ as Smart Cities or IoV (Internet of Vehicles), require\nmuch greater throughput\
    \ to function correctly and offer an optimal user experience.\nThese types of\
    \ solutions require capabilities that are only offered by 5G. IoT data\nare visioned\
    \ to increase in data provided per area by 1000 times [57] which means\nIoT applications\
    \ will be part of our everyday lives. The current data are provided\nmainly by\
    \ sensors, but more complex devices will mean that data will be gathered\nfrom\
    \ additional sources. This exponential growth in data consumption will also need\n\
    to be stored in scalable data storages, and this is where cloud computing comes\
    \ in.\nSome of the most famous architectural trends of IoT devices follow three\
    \ principles:\nHardware: All sensor nodes that gather data, their communication\
    \ methods, and the\nhardware interface with the user.\nMiddleware: The layer in\
    \ charge of storing and analyzing the data and monitoring\nthe devices.\nPresentation\
    \ layer: Commonly called the front end, this presents visualization tools\nbetter\
    \ to understand our devices’ current state and behavior.\n5G technologies can\
    \ impact the hardware and middleware layer. As the technology is\nmore energy\
    \ efﬁcient, the devices do not need massive antennas, which can lead to\nincreased\
    \ consumption. At the middleware layer, as devices can communicate more\ndata\
    \ in a given period, this layer will beneﬁt from extra data to improve any statistical\n\
    or machine learning model.\n3.6. 5G Technologies\nThe purpose of this section\
    \ is to describe some of the most popular technologies\nimplemented with 5G.\n\
    Figure 8 shows characteristics and technical speciﬁcations of 5G. 5G networks\
    \ offer\nseveral key characteristics and technical speciﬁcations that make them\
    \ ideal for a wide range\nof applications. 5G provides signiﬁcantly increased\

    \ such as virtual and augmented reality. It also offers lower\nlatency, making\
    \ it suitable for real-time communication and response applications, such\nas\
    \ autonomous vehicles and remote surgery. 5G is highly reliable, with features\
    \ such\nas network slicing and redundant network paths, ensuring devices stay\
    \ connected. 5G\nenables massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable\
    \ and low-latency\ncommunication (URLLC), making it suitable for mission-critical\
    \ applications, such as\nindustrial automation. Additionally, 5G offers network\
    \ slicing, beamforming, and uses\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for even\
    \ higher bandwidth and faster data rates.\nOverall, 5G networks offer signiﬁcant\
    \ improvements in bandwidth, latency, reliability, and\nﬂexibility, making them\
    \ well-suited for a wide range of applications.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n17 of\

    1.\nMassive MIMO: This technology is responsible for sending and receiving multiple\n\
    signals simultaneously, utilizing the same radio channel. While other technologies,\n\
    such as Wi-Fi or 4G-LTE, have utilized this technology, massive MIMO performs\
    \ best\nwhen paired with 5G technologies. This technology uses extra antennas\
    \ to move\nenergy into smaller regions of space, which means spectral efﬁciency\
    \ and coverage\nare improved [58].\n2.\nNOMA: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access:\
    \ A radio access technology that plays a vital\nrole in 5G applications [59].\
    \ This technology offers several beneﬁts, such as low latency\nand massive high-speed\
    \ connectivity. Code domain NOMA is commonly paired with\nmMIMO, drastically improving\
    \ spectral efﬁciency [60]. Power domain NOMA is\ncommonly utilized with MIMO,\
    \ beamforming, and even cooperative communications,\nbeing one of the most ﬂexible\
    \ technologies utilized in 5G implementations.\n3.\nMillimeter Wave: This technology\
    \ uses a frequency band between 30 GHz and\n300 GHz and derives its name from\
    \ the 1 to 10 mm waves utilized by the tech-\nnology. Utilized commonly in radar\
    \ applications, this technology is being paired with\n5G to improve spectrum bandwidth\
    \ and increase spectrum utilizations. The main\nbeneﬁt of pairing this technology\
    \ with 5G is the spectrum freedom linked to mmWave.\nStandard technologies, such\
    \ as GPS, 4G, and satellite connections, utilize the 1 GHz\nto 6 GHz spectrum,\
    \ which is becoming very crowded [61]. Because mmWave is new\nand has a massive\
    \ spectral range, 5G provides an improved user experience through\nthis combination.\n\
    4.\nMachine Learning Techniques: Supervised and unsupervised models are being\
    \ im-\nplemented in 5G technologies to improve overall network capacities, predict\
    \ energy\nconsumption, and optimize tracking technologies such as beamforming.\
    \ In the su-\npervised category, some 5G networks utilize Linear Regression Algorithms\
    \ to predict\nthe scheduling of nodes [62]. Other supervised models utilize Deep\
    \ Neural Networks\nto predict beamforming vectors. Then, unsupervised learning\
    \ models are used to\nimprove handover selection and reduce interruption of services,\
    \ as well as they can\nreduce latency by clustering fog nodes.\n5.\nUnmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicles (UAV): Being the most innovative proposal, current 5G\nresearchers\
    \ are utilizing UAVs to improve network coverage. These UAVs will assist\nthe\
    \ terrestrial network by serving as beacons. The high altitude of these planes\
    \ could\nsolve many interference problems and even replace entirely terrestrial\
    \ cellular net-\nworks [63]. UAVs, commonly known as drones, have become increasingly\
    \ popular for\nboth commercial and personal use. With the advent of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT, UAVs\ncan now be equipped with a wide range of sensors and devices\
    \ that can transmit\nreal-time data to ground stations for analysis and decision\
    \ making [64]. There are\nseveral potential implementations of UAVs in the context\
    \ of 5G and IoT. One such\nimplementation is in the area of precision agriculture.\
    \ UAVs can be used to gather data\non crop growth, soil conditions, and other\
    \ factors that affect agricultural production.\nThese data can be transmitted\
    \ in real time to a ground station for analysis and used\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n\
    18 of 41\nto optimize planting, fertilization, and irrigation schedules [65].\
    \ 5G networks and\nIoT sensors can provide the necessary bandwidth and low latency\
    \ for this type of\napplication. Another potential application of UAVs in the\
    \ context of 5G and IoT is\nin industrial inspection and maintenance. UAVs equipped\
    \ with cameras and other\nsensors can be used to inspect and monitor equipment\
    \ and infrastructure such as\npower lines and wind turbines. Real-time data transmission\
    \ via 5G networks can\nenable remote monitoring and control of these systems,\
    \ improving their reliability\nand reducing maintenance costs [66]. UAVs can also\
    \ be used for emergency response\nand disaster management. In the event of a natural\
    \ disaster, such as a hurricane or\nearthquake, UAVs can be deployed to assess\
    \ damage and provide real-time informa-\ntion to ﬁrst responders. The data collected\
    \ can be transmitted via 5G networks to\nemergency management centers for analysis\
    \ and decision making. UAVs can be used\nfor surveillance and security purposes.\
    \ In public safety applications, UAVs can be\nused to monitor crowd movements\
    \ and gather intelligence on potential threats. In\nprivate security applications,\
    \ UAVs can be used to patrol and monitor facilities for\nintruders or other security\
    \ threats. The combination of UAVs with 5G networks and\nIoT sensors can enable\
    \ a wide range of applications in various industries. With the\npotential to improve\
    \ efﬁciency, reduce costs, and enhance safety, it is likely that we\nwill see\
    \ an increase in the adoption of UAVs in the coming years.\n3.7. 5G Problems\n\
    5G offers excellent improvements over last-generation mobile communication tech-\n\
    nologies. However, many problems related to technological complications, security\
    \ and\nprivacy implications, and even social implications have been discovered.\n\
    Technical complications are related primarily to interference. 5G as a technology\
    \ has\ncomplications related to interference, being as sensible as being dramatically\
    \ affected by\nmild rain in urbanized areas [67]. Even though the technologies\
    \ mentioned previously\nhelp mitigate these problems, 5G still needs to be ready\
    \ to be used on a massive scale.\nTests performed in several countries utilizing\
    \ small cells show the need for more extensive\narchitectures to offer full coverage\
    \ and optimal user experience [68]. This means costly\narchitectures will lead\
    \ providers to focus mainly on urban areas, leaving rural areas unat-\ntended.\
    \ This leads to the following obstacles, which are ethical and social implications.\n\
    One of the main advantages of 5G is the ability to offer improved connections\
    \ to people\nin poor conditions. However, right now, it is only used as a marketing\
    \ stunt because 5G\narchitectures are considerably expensive and cannot offer\
    \ coverage in rural areas. As 5G\nequipment and technology become more widely\
    \ adopted in the following years, we expect\nbig strides in this department.\n\
    Another ethical and social implication is IoV technologies enabled by 5G. As we\
    \ see\nmore autonomous driving cars, and 5G will enable more precise driving for\
    \ these cars, as\nwell as broad adoption of them, we are encountering huge moral\
    \ dilemmas in cases where\ncar accidents are caused by autonomous vehicles. Security\
    \ implications arise from the trend\nof connecting vehicles to the internet, which\
    \ means people can be kidnapped remotely by\ntheir car if hackers gain control\
    \ of their vehicle via the web.\nThe main problems mentioned and explained above\
    \ are listed below:\n•\nTechnical complications related to interference, including\
    \ sensitivity to mild rain in\nurban areas.\n•\nNeed for extensive and costly\
    \ architectures to offer full coverage and optimal user\nexperience, which may\
    \ lead providers to focus mainly on urban areas, leaving rural\nareas unattended.\n\
    •\nEthical and social implications related to the inability to offer improved\
    \ connections\nto people in poor conditions due to the high cost of 5G architectures\
    \ and the lack of\ncoverage in rural areas.\n•\nSecurity implications arising\
    \ from the trend of connecting vehicles to the internet,\nwhich could result in\
    \ remote kidnappings by hackers.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n19 of 41\nTable 2 compares\
    \ the problems presented by 5G and IoT services across several key\nareas, namely\
    \ security, latency, interference, cost, and compatibility. In terms of security,\n\
    5G networks are vulnerable to a range of threats, such as DDoS attacks, identity\
    \ theft, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks, while IoT devices can suffer from security\
    \ breaches due to weak\nencryption, passwords, and outdated ﬁrmware. Regarding\
    \ latency, 5G networks have lower\nlatency, which can be a problem for certain\
    \ IoT applications that require real-time response,\nwhile IoT services may suffer\
    \ from latency due to network congestion, distance from the\nserver, and the number\
    \ of devices connected to the network. Interference is another factor\nthat can\
    \ affect both 5G and IoT services, with both being susceptible to interference\
    \ from\nother wireless devices and environmental factors. Cost is also a concern,\
    \ as the high cost of\n5G infrastructure and services may limit its usefulness\
    \ for many IoT applications, while IoT\nservices may also be expensive to deploy\
    \ and maintain, particularly if they require high\nbandwidth or specialized hardware.\
    \ Finally, compatibility is a potential issue for both 5G\nand IoT services, with\
    \ some IoT devices not being compatible with 5G networks, and IoT\nservices limited\
    \ by compatibility issues with proprietary hardware or software.\nTable 2. Comparison\
    \ of problems presented by 5G and IoT services\nProblem\n5G\nIoT Services\nSecurity\n\
    5G networks are vulnerable to various security threats,\nsuch as DDoS attacks,\
    \ identity theft, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\nIoT devices are susceptible\
    \ to security breaches\ndue to poor encryption, weak passwords, and\noutdated\
    \ ﬁrmware.\nLatency\n5G networks have lower latency, which can be a\nproblem for\
    \ certain IoT applications that require\nreal-time response.\nIoT services may\
    \ suffer from latency due to\nnetwork congestion, distance from the server, and\n\
    the number of devices connected to the network.\nInterference\n5G networks can\
    \ experience interference from other\nwireless devices, which can disrupt the\
    \ transmission of\ndata.\nIoT services may also suffer from interference due\n\
    to environmental factors, such as obstacles and\ninterference from other wireless\
    \ devices.\nCost\nThe cost of 5G infrastructure and services may be\nprohibitively\
    \ high for many IoT applications,\nparticularly those that require large-scale\
    \ deployment.\nIoT services may also be expensive to deploy and\nmaintain, particularly\
    \ if they require high\nbandwidth or specialized hardware.\nCompatibility\nSome\
    \ IoT devices may not be compatible with 5G\nnetworks, which can limit their usefulness\
    \ in certain\napplications.\nIoT services may also be limited by compatibility\n\
    issues, particularly if they rely on proprietary\nhardware or software.\n3.8.\
    \ Coexistence of 5G Networks and IoT Applications\nThe coexistence of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT applications has the potential to revolu-\ntionize several industries\
    \ by providing ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,\nmassive machine-type\
    \ communications, and network slicing for multiple services and\napplications\
    \ [18]. One novel idea is the use of 5G networks for industrial automation and\n\
    autonomous vehicles, where ultra-reliable and low-latency communication is critical\
    \ for\nensuring the safety and reliability of the system. Another innovative application\
    \ is the use\nof 5G networks for vehicle-to-everything communication, where autonomous\
    \ vehicles can\nexchange information with other vehicles and infrastructure to\
    \ improve trafﬁc management\nand safety [69]. The use of 5G networks for smart\
    \ cities and agriculture can also be highly\nbeneﬁcial, as it can enable massive\
    \ machine-type communication to support a large number\nof IoT devices, such as\
    \ sensors and actuators, and facilitate data collection, analysis, and\ndecision\
    \ making. Additionally, the use of network slicing can enable multiple services\
    \ and\napplications to coexist on the same infrastructure while maintaining their\
    \ unique require-\nments for security, reliability, and latency. However, the\
    \ coexistence of 5G networks and IoT\napplications also presents several challenges,\
    \ such as security, interference, compatibility,\nand cost [35]. For example,\
    \ security is critical for protecting IoT devices and networks from\ncyber attacks,\
    \ while interference from other wireless devices and environmental factors can\n\
    affect both 5G and IoT services. Moreover, compatibility issues can arise when\
    \ IoT devices\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n20 of 41\nare not compatible with 5G networks,\
    \ and the high cost of deploying and maintaining 5G\ninfrastructure and IoT services\
    \ can limit their widespread adoption. Overall, the coexis-\ntence of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT applications presents both opportunities and challenges and\nrequires\
    \ careful consideration of their technical requirements, security, and compatibility\
    \ to\nrealize their full potential.\nTable 3 provides a summary of the coexistence\
    \ of various 5G services and networks\nwith IoT applications. It highlights the\
    \ wireless technology, algorithms used, and coex-\nistence of services with 4G\
    \ and Wi-Fi. The table includes several 5G services, such as\n5G NR, 5G-V2X, 5G\

    \ Difﬁculties\nNowadays, with the development of new technologies, networks face\
    \ different chal-\nlenges. Issues such as coverage, latency, availability, and\
    \ accessibility, among others, appear.\nMoreover, taking into account a more profound\
    \ or more centralized point to the character-\nistics of the network, issues such\
    \ as latency, interference, spectrum use according to the\ntechnology being used,\
    \ and others appear.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n21 of 41\nInterference in 5G networks\
    \ can occur due to a variety of factors such as environmental\nconditions, radio\
    \ frequency congestion, and the deployment of too many access points\nin a limited\
    \ area. These issues can cause signal loss or degradation, resulting in poor\n\
    network performance and reduced data transfer rates. Interference in 5G networks\
    \ can\nhave a signiﬁcant impact on IoT devices that rely on a stable and reliable\
    \ connection to\noperate effectively.\nIoT devices are designed to transmit small\
    \ amounts of data over long periods, often\nusing low power and low bandwidth\
    \ networks. The interference in 5G networks can cause\ndelays or interruptions\
    \ in the transmission of data between IoT devices and the cloud-based\nsystems\
    \ they rely on. These disruptions can impact critical functions, such as real-time\n\
    monitoring of environmental conditions, trafﬁc management, and energy consumption.\
    \ In\naddition, interference in 5G networks can result in increased latency, which\
    \ can make it\ndifﬁcult for IoT devices to communicate with each other in a timely\
    \ manner.\nAnother critical aspect of interference in 5G networks is the potential\
    \ for security\nbreaches. As the number of connected devices increases, the risk\
    \ of cyber attacks also\ngrows. Interference in 5G networks can make it easier\
    \ for hackers to gain unauthorized\naccess to IoT devices and the data they transmit.\
    \ This can have serious consequences,\nparticularly for devices that are used\
    \ in critical infrastructure, such as healthcare systems,\npower grids, and transportation\
    \ networks.\nTo mitigate the impact of interference in 5G networks on IoT devices,\
    \ it is essential to\nensure that the network is properly conﬁgured and managed.\
    \ This includes deploying ac-\ncess points strategically to minimize congestion,\
    \ using directional antennas to focus signals\nand reduce interference, and implementing\
    \ security measures to prevent unauthorized\naccess. In addition, new technologies\
    \ such as edge computing and network slicing can help\nto reduce latency and improve\
    \ the reliability of IoT device communication.\nTable 4 outlines some of the main\
    \ types of interference that can impact 5G networks\nand the IoT. Interference\
    \ can occur due to a variety of factors, such as noise, multipath,\nco-channel\
    \ interference, interference from other devices or wireless networks, and jamming.\n\
    One of the key aspects of network performance that interference can affect is\
    \ coverage.\nInterference can reduce the coverage of a wireless network by increasing\
    \ the signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) threshold required for reliable communication.\
    \ When there is noise,\nmultipath, or interference from other wireless networks\
    \ present, signals may not reach as\nfar or penetrate as deeply into buildings,\
    \ resulting in reduced overall coverage. Another\naspect that can be affected\
    \ by interference is latency. Interference can increase latency by\nintroducing\
    \ delays in signal transmission or reception. For instance, multipath interference\n\
    can cause signals to arrive at a receiver at slightly different times, leading\
    \ to signal distortion\nand increased latency. This delay can be particularly\
    \ problematic for real-time applications,\nsuch as gaming or video conferencing.\
    \ Interference can also impact the availability of a\nwireless network. When there\
    \ is co-channel interference or interference from other devices,\nit can cause\
    \ collisions or channel saturation, leading to reduced availability. This can\
    \ result\nin packet loss or connection drops, making it difﬁcult for users to\
    \ access the network and\nresulting in a poor user experience. Access to a wireless\
    \ network can also be affected by\ninterference. Interference can make it harder\
    \ for devices to connect to a network, leading\nto connection failures or reduced\
    \ bandwidth. This can be particularly problematic in\nareas with high device density,\
    \ such as urban environments. Interference can also affect\nmodulation and coding.\
    \ When there is interference present, the quality of the signal can\ndegrade,\
    \ making it more difﬁcult for the receiver to demodulate and decode the signal.\n\
    This can result in errors and reduce the overall throughput of the network.\n\

    \ of 5G is interference. It should be\nremembered that interference, by deﬁnition,\
    \ is when two electromagnetic waves overlap.\nThis overlapping causes communication\
    \ failures from where the wave is sent to where it is\nreceived. There are two\
    \ types of interference: constructive and destructive. Constructive\ninterference\
    \ occurs when the waves overlap or collide in phase, and this causes the resulting\n\
    wave to have a greater amplitude. Furthermore, destructive interference is when\
    \ there is\nan out-of-phase overlap, where the resultant of this wave will be\
    \ of lower amplitude [80].\nSome networks may be more susceptible to interference\
    \ depending on the type of wave\nthey handle, i.e., the frequency used in the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. RF can give this\ninterference, whereas in 5G networks,\
    \ millimeter bands and below 6 GHz bands are used.\nIn addition, it must be taken\
    \ into account that these interferences will continue to grow\nwith the development\
    \ of technology.\nFigure 9 covers various types of interference in wireless communication\
    \ systems in\n5G. Adjacent channel interference occurs when adjacent frequencies\
    \ or channels overlap\ndue to imperfections in ﬁlters or non-linearity in ampliﬁers.\
    \ Inter-cell interference happens\nwhen two users from neighboring cells try to\
    \ use the same frequency band simultaneously\ndue to resource limitation within\
    \ the network. Intra-channel and inter-channel interference\noccur due to physical\
    \ proximity of devices and low power within the macro-cell network,\nrespectively.\
    \ Inter-symbol interference results from signal distortion due to phase or\namplitude\
    \ dispersion in the channel. Inter-carrier occurs due to frequency offsets between\n\
    sub-carriers. Inter-numerology interference arises due to non-orthogonality in\
    \ the system,\ncausing difﬁculties for symbol alignment. Cross-link interference\
    \ occurs when signals\nare transmitted to neighboring cells in different directions\
    \ simultaneously. Inter-beam\ninterference happens due to the use of multi-beam\
    \ antenna systems, causing interference\nfrom adjacent beams. Multi-user interference\
    \ happens when several users try to transmit\ntheir information requests at the\
    \ same time, and MU-MIMO is used to increase the capacity\nand performance of\
    \ wireless broadcasting systems.\nWe must consider that with the evolution of\
    \ higher data rates, we are looking for\nthe implementation in a frequency spectrum\
    \ that is becoming more saturated daily. The\ndevelopment in these frequencies\
    \ makes the operator reuse the same frequencies for\nneighboring cells to save\
    \ spectrum. This development causes high interference between\ncells [81]. In\
    \ addition to these, other interferences also occur within the networks. The\n\
    classiﬁcation of these interferences is as follows:\n•\nAdjacent channel interference:\
    \ Adjacent channel interference is a problem that occurs\nin many devices and\
    \ many frequency ranges. This occurs when an adjacent frequency\nor the adjacent\
    \ channel of the one used by our device overlaps. This problem occurs\nin 5G,\
    \ as in other mobile technologies. This type of interference is mainly caused,\
    \ as\nstated in [82], by an imperfection in the ﬁlters, where they cannot ﬁlter\
    \ the desired\nsignal correctly. These imperfections result in nearby frequencies\
    \ passing into the\npassband. In turn, this occurs because the ampliﬁers are not\
    \ linear.\n•\nIntra-cell and inter-cell interference: Inter-cell interference\
    \ is one of the most signiﬁ-\ncant causes of network performance degradation.\
    \ This occurs when two users from\nneighboring cells attempt to use the same frequency\
    \ band simultaneously. This occurs,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n23 of 41\nas said\
    \ in [83], because of resource limitation within the network, due to the frequency\n\
    reuse factor. In the same way, inter-cell interference is identiﬁed when a Base\
    \ Station\nconnects directly in the close range of another BS, and that is when\
    \ there is a simulta-\nneous transmission in that reuse. A distortion appears\
    \ by the interference that gives\nthe user and other equipment in the same cell.\n\
    •\nIntra-Channel and Inter-Channel interference: Inter-channel interference usually\
    \ oc-\ncurs when there is a low power within the macro-cell network. Then, when\
    \ communi-\ncating, the information is forwarded to the nearest base station.\
    \ When the transmission\nis made, it is completed through fast switching and restricts\
    \ delays and propagation\nlosses. However, this produces intra-channel interference\
    \ that affects the valuable\nsignal. On the other hand, inter-channel interference\
    \ occurs due to the physical prox-\nimity of the devices when two separate frequency\
    \ bands cause interference with each\nother. As these devices operate in close\
    \ range, the transmitter of a high-power signal\ninterferes with the receiver\
    \ of a weak signal. It is important to emphasize that 5G IoT\nnetworks or devices\
    \ with channels in the MHz range are susceptible to this type of\ninterference\
    \ due to the proximity and number of nearby devices. One way to mitigate\nthis\
    \ type of interference is through spatial modulation via MIMO [84].\n•\nInter-Symbol\
    \ Interference: Inter-symbol interference occurs when one or more symbols\ninterfere\
    \ with other symbols. It is caused by phase or amplitude dispersion in the\nchannel,\
    \ resulting in signal distortion. This can be seen in OFDMA, where multipath\n\
    propagation occurs. One study [85] exposed how this type of interference can be\n\
    an excellent challenge for network systems and should be sought to improve the\n\
    efﬁciency of the bandwidth while seeking alternatives in the modulation. This\
    \ is in\norder to counteract this type of interference.\n•\nInter-numerology interference:\
    \ Multiple numerology is a model to provide ﬂexibility\nfor devices in different\
    \ services. For these numerologies, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 kHz\nchannels are\
    \ used. They aim to improve performance and signiﬁcant bandwidth.\nAs stated in\
    \ [86], the authors introduce a non-orthogonality in the system, causing\ndifﬁculties\
    \ for symbol alignment in the time domain. When sampling at the same\nfrequency,\
    \ numerology tends to align differently, making synchronization within the\nframe\
    \ difﬁcult. This is known as interference between numerologies.\n•\nCross-Link\
    \ Interference: This interference occurs when signals are transmitted to\nneighboring\
    \ cells in different directions simultaneously, either in time frequency or\n\
    arbitrarily overlapping resources. As mentioned in [87], there are different types\
    \ of\ninterference and different ways in which it occurs. For example, the Base\
    \ Station\nreceives interference from user equipment devices in adjacent cells,\
    \ or a downlink\nuser equipment receives interference from a second database.\n\
    •\nInter Beam Interference: With the high demand for technological services, the\
    \ aim\nhas been to improve spectral efﬁciency and network performance. In trade-offs\
    \ for\nnetworks such as 5G, where the quality and capacity must be high, the solution\
    \ of\nincorporating a multi-beam antenna system such as mMIMO was sought, as explored\n\
    in detail in [88]. This technique identiﬁes the best route to providing optimal\
    \ perfor-\nmance to a user. This approach helps compensate for transmission attenuation\
    \ losses,\nespecially in millimeter-wave communication. In this case, the base\
    \ station generates\nmultiple narrow beams of mainly RF energy in all directions\
    \ of the coverage area. This\ncauses a spatial division of multiple beams, introducing\
    \ interference. Adjacent beams\ncause this interference from the same cell or\
    \ a neighboring cell.\n•\nMulti-user Interference: Multi-user interference is\
    \ due to the industry’s quest for\nhigher data rates in applications and the dramatic\
    \ increase in subscribers to wireless\ncommunications [89]. The techniques used\
    \ for this type of technology are given by MU-\nMIMO, a 5G generation technique\
    \ that helps increase the capacity and performance of\nwireless broadcasting systems.\
    \ Multi-user interference occurs when several users try\nto transmit their information\
    \ requests at the same time.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n24 of 41\nFigure 9. Main\
    \ concepts of interference in 5G.\n3.9.2. Interference in 5G\nThe different classiﬁcations\
    \ of interference have been explored. Now it is sought\nas part of the state of\
    \ the art to understand interference within 5G. The enrichment of\ninterference\
    \ in technologies such as Hetnets, IoT, D2D, Relay Node, and New Radio 5G\nwill\
    \ be sought.\n•\nInterference in Hetnets: Hetnets are 5G heterogeneous networks.\
    \ They aim to pro-\nvide wireless coverage for mobile subscribers and indoor and\
    \ outdoor applications.\nHetnets are multi-tier network systems that deploy small\
    \ cells in populated areas.\nThese cells are characterized by having a short range\
    \ and low power consumption.\nThis network comprises access points, which allow\
    \ high density, improvements in\nnetwork ﬂexibility, and so on [90]. Due to the\
    \ infrastructure and locations for deploy-\ning this type of network, they are\
    \ prone to different types of interference, such as\nintra-cell, inter-cell, and\
    \ adjacency channels. This type of problem is due to its poor\nsystematization\
    \ and organization in its network design. There are types of interference\nwithin\
    \ heterogeneous networks due to their infrastructure or grouping depending\non\
    \ the need to be met. The ﬁrst interference that appears is Co-tier interference.\
    \ This\ntype of interference appears mostly in femtocells, where there is much\
    \ demand for\nhigher data rates. This environment allows coverage, such as low-power\
    \ radio access\npoints, giving various services at home [91]. This type of interference\
    \ is observed\nwhen multiple users reside in the same network tier, where transmission\
    \ occurs over\nadjacent cells within the femtocell. Similar to co-tier, cross-tier\
    \ interference can appear.\nThe difference is that the co-tier is the inter-cell\
    \ interference, and the cross-tier is the\ninterference between the femtocell\
    \ and macro-cells, considering that the femtocell is\ninside the macro-cell [92].\
    \ Last but not least, in [93], channel control interference says\nthat one of\
    \ the most critical factors for channel control is the physical control format\n\
    indicator channel. This channel carries scheduling and synchronization information\n\
    for the uplink and downlink link data channels. As the transport is by physical\
    \ means,\nthis will induce interference.\n•\nInterference in D2D: With the introduction\
    \ of 5G, the best wireless systems have\nconstantly sought a solution that allows\
    \ the best quality of communication. Device-\nto-device networks are one of the\
    \ candidates to be the future of 5G networks. Direct\ncontact between two mobiles\
    \ increases efﬁciency in the spectrum. However, it always\nbrings some challenges,\
    \ in this case dealing with interference. As discussed in the\ndescription of\
    \ Hetnets above, these use a high connectivity capacity thanks to their\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n25 of 41\nstructure with macro-cell and femtocell. They allow\
    \ good performance [94]. With\nthe introduction of D2D, a cellular network is\
    \ sought that signiﬁcantly improves\nspectral efﬁciency and performance. However,\
    \ some challenges are the need for more\nsecurity that this type of technology\
    \ presents and interference. On the interference\nside, they appear related to\
    \ inter-cell interference. Furthermore, intra-cell may be\nrelated to adjacent\
    \ frequency. Furthermore, we must remember that there are types\nof interference\
    \ typical of D2D nodes, D2D-to-CU interference, and inter-D2D node\ninterference,\
    \ among others.\n•\nInterference in IoT and Smart Cities: We cannot limit our\
    \ minds to just one application\nwhen discussing the Internet of things. However,\
    \ everything from D2D devices and\nV2X to smart homes or buildings is part of\
    \ it. The conception of IoT with 5G has\nevolved in large and small ecosystems.\
    \ IoT in some applications is used over the\nunlicensed ISM band, which is used\
    \ for various physical devices to properly leverage\nthe spectrum to adhere to\
    \ the conditions and regulations of short radio communication.\nThe Internet of\
    \ Things has been seen as the other great leap in the evolution of the\nInternet.\
    \ With this in mind, developing smart cities will help create a more sustainable\n\
    and cost-efﬁcient ecosystem [95]. The combination of technologies such as 5G,\
    \ IoT,\nand others will enable big data, offering complex services to the community,\
    \ adding\nmembers in smart cities, and ensuring compatibility. However, it should\
    \ be noted\nthat interference must be characterized. When talking about smart\
    \ cities using Wi-Fi\nbecause of the use of the millimeter band, physical obstacles\
    \ such as walls are things\nto keep in mind, in addition to channel overlapping\
    \ and inter-carrier interference [96].\n3.9.3. Optimization Challenges in 5G Networks\n\
    5G is presented as a developed environment with an ecosystem where the boundaries\n\
    are complete cities. 5G technologies promise high-speed and low-latency data transmission\n\
    using the millimeter band. Although this frequency band allows these advantages,\
    \ it only\nallows short distances. By allowing such short distances, problems\
    \ such as interference\nbecome apparent. The optimization of this type of network\
    \ should always be used to\nget the best out of it. In 5G, techniques such as\
    \ MIMO and beamforming are used to\nreduce interference or signal degradation\
    \ [90]. It should be noted that optimizations for\n5G networks include different\
    \ architectures that are part of this type of network. These\narchitectures can\
    \ be divided into non-standalone and standalone.\nOptimizing these architectures,\
    \ depending on their niche, can be proﬁtable, as the\ncommunication varies. Communication\
    \ can be more accessible or restricted depending\non the architecture. At the\
    \ same time, different modulations can be obtained to enhance\ndata transmission,\
    \ transmission speed, and latency. In the same way, with 5G, most of the\narchitectures\
    \ allow the incorporation of MIMO. Thanks to beamforming management, it is\npossible\
    \ to optimize the use of frequencies for transmission so that some technologies\
    \ can\nsend information in the mmWaves range.\nFrom interference in the case of\
    \ NR, other interferences negatively affect the data\ntransmission in this architecture\
    \ due to the nature of this architecture. These are inter-\ncarrier interference\
    \ and phase interference. This is because it uses the mmWave frequency\nrange.\
    \ In turn, another interference that damages NR is numerology interference [97].\n\
    The evolution of mobile networks from 3G to 4G and now to 5G has signiﬁcantly\n\
    impacted the services and Internet of Things devices. Each new generation has\
    \ provided\nfaster data transfer speeds, increased bandwidth, and improved reliability,\
    \ enabling the\nemergence of new services and applications that were previously\
    \ not possible on mobile\ndevices. As 5G networks become more widely adopted,\
    \ they will continue to unlock new\nopportunities for innovation, transforming\
    \ the way we interact with our devices and the\nworld around us.\nTable 5 shows\
    \ the impact of each mobile generation starting with 3G and explains the\nimpact\
    \ in an IoT context.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n26 of 41\nTable 5. Mobile generations\
    \ and IoT.\nYear\nTechnology\nImpact in IoT\n2000\n3G allows devices to\nconnect\
    \ to the internet since\n3G enables mobile and\nwireless internet\nconnections.\n\
    With internet connections, electronic\ndevices start transmitting data through\n\
    the internet, the ﬁrst step to developing\nIoT devices.\n2008\n4G enables cloud\n\
    computing technology and\ntransmits information with\nthe IP protocol. In addition,\n\
    4G increased the bandwidth\nof each transmission.\nThe data transmission through\
    \ IP protocol\nenables an easy communication method with\nelectronic devices.\
    \ The cloud enables a way to\ndevelop more affordable solutions.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the internet connection cost\ndecreases because 4G delivers a cheap way to\n\
    transmit data as IP protocols manage the data\nmore efﬁciently. This generation\
    \ is the most\nimportant in an IoT context because the\nindustry has all the resources\
    \ to connect\ndevices to the cloud.\n2019\nWith 5G, an essential\nfeature is the\
    \ beam width,\nan important key in the IoT\ncontext.\nIf we have more bandwidth,\
    \ we can provide\nbetter solutions, such as real-time monitoring\nsystems. In\
    \ our society, these solutions are\nvital if we want to automate processes. For\n\
    this reason, 5G plays an essential role in the\nIoT context because the industry\
    \ is trying to\nautomate all its processes.\nNew technologies and recent research\
    \ about wireless communication have created\nnew ways to transmit and receive\
    \ data. With the evolution of technology such as 5G, new\nfeatures arrived to\
    \ provide/perform the ways to send and receive data. IoT has shown\nmore beneﬁts,\
    \ helping with other technologies such as machine learning, cloud computing,\n\
    and others. Since the data can be processed, each device forms a swarm intelligence\
    \ that\nallows automatization and avoids wasting resources in the industry.\n\
    Another factor in analyzing is the interference with the channels, since our houses,\n\
    ofﬁces, and even natural places have electronic devices that typically use the\
    \ 2.4 GHz band,\nwhich causes interference in this band. Therefore, 5G incorporates\
    \ new bands to avoid\nthe interference caused by this massive consumption of 2.4\
    \ GHz. We need to compare\nthe features of 3G, 4G, and 5G to understand why 5G\
    \ is an essential key in smart cities.\nThe main technical characteristics of\
    \ these three generations of technologies can be seen in\nTable 6.\nTable 6. Important\

    \ for the use of 5G technology in the IoT. The ﬁrst\nfeature mentioned is bandwidth.\
    \ Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be\ntransmitted over a network\
    \ or a communication channel in a given amount of time. In\nthe context of 5G,\
    \ higher bandwidth means that more data can be transmitted over the\nairwaves\
    \ in a shorter period of time, which can result in faster and more reliable 5G\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n27 of 41\ntransmissions. Another feature highlighted is\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, which can analyze\nall the data generated by the IoT\
    \ devices to take accurate decisions. With the use of AI,\nIoT devices can identify\
    \ patterns, make predictions, and take actions based on the data\ngathered. This\
    \ feature is essential to support IoT applications that require real-time decision\n\
    making, such as smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. The third\
    \ feature is\nreal-time monitoring and management, which means the capability\
    \ to monitor and manage\nelectronic devices. This feature allows IoT devices to\
    \ be monitored and managed from a\ncentral location, which can be very useful\
    \ for large-scale applications, such as industrial\nautomation or smart grid management.\
    \ Swarm intelligence is another feature mentioned,\nwhich means that each IoT\
    \ device can be a node and work with other nodes to create a\nswarm intelligence.\
    \ This feature enables IoT devices to work collaboratively and efﬁciently,\nproviding\
    \ better performance and reliability in complex applications. Quality of service\n\
    (QoS) is also listed as a signiﬁcant feature that 5G can provide in IoT connections.\
    \ With\n5G, IoT devices can experience better connectivity, lower latency, and\
    \ higher throughput,\nwhich can improve the overall QoS and performance of IoT\
    \ applications. In the context\nof IoT connections, QoS refers to the ability\
    \ of the network to provide reliable and high-\nperformance connectivity to IoT\
    \ devices. 5G is a promising technology for IoT connections,\nas it can provide\
    \ several features that can improve the overall QoS and performance of IoT\napplications.\
    \ 5G is designed to provide a signiﬁcantly improved QoS compared to previous\n\
    generations of mobile networks. This is achieved through a combination of advanced\n\
    technologies and features that are built into the 5G standard. One of the key\
    \ features of\n5G that can contribute to a better QoS is the use of advanced radio\
    \ access technologies.\nThese technologies, such as massive MIMO and beamforming,\
    \ allow for more efﬁcient\nuse of the radio spectrum and better signal quality.\
    \ This means that 5G can provide better\nconnectivity and signal strength, which\
    \ can improve the reliability and availability of the\nnetwork. Another important\
    \ feature of 5G that can contribute to a better QoS is the use of\nnetwork slicing.\
    \ Network slicing allows the network to be divided into multiple virtual\nnetworks,\
    \ each tailored to speciﬁc use cases and requirements. This means that different\n\
    applications and services can be given different levels of priority, bandwidth,\
    \ and latency\nrequirements, depending on their needs. This can improve the QoS\
    \ for each individual\napplication and user. In addition, 5G can provide lower\
    \ latency, higher throughput, and\nbetter support for massive IoT deployments,\
    \ all of which can contribute to a better QoS.\nLower latency means that there\
    \ is less delay between the transmission of data and its\nreception, which can\
    \ enable real-time communication and faster response times. Higher\nthroughput\
    \ means that more data can be transmitted over the network in a given time,\n\
    which can improve the performance of applications that require high-bandwidth\
    \ data\ntransfer. Finally, better support for massive IoT deployments means that\
    \ the network can\nhandle a large number of connected devices and data trafﬁc,\
    \ without compromising the\nQoS for individual devices or applications.\nLow latency\
    \ is another feature that 5G can offer, reducing the delay between data\ntransmission\
    \ and reception. This feature is particularly important for applications that\n\
    require immediate decision making, such as autonomous vehicles or remote surgery.\
    \ Cloud\ncomputing is mentioned as a feature that 5G can provide in IoT connections.\
    \ With 5G, IoT\ndevices can connect to the cloud more efﬁciently, and each device\
    \ can use all the resources\nof the cloud, such as storage and processing power.\
    \ This feature can signiﬁcantly improve\nthe performance and scalability of IoT\
    \ applications, especially those that require large\namounts of data processing\
    \ and storage.\nLow latency is particularly important for applications that require\
    \ immediate decision\nmaking, such as autonomous vehicles or remote surgery. With\
    \ 5G, the latency can be\nreduced to as low as one millisecond, which can enable\
    \ real-time communication and\nfaster response times. Furthermore, 5G can provide\
    \ higher throughput, which refers to\nthe amount of data that can be transmitted\
    \ over a network in a given time. With higher\nthroughput, IoT devices can transmit\
    \ and receive larger amounts of data, which can\nimprove the performance of IoT\
    \ applications that require high-bandwidth data transfer,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n\
    28 of 41\nsuch as video streaming or real-time sensor data. Cloud computing is\
    \ another feature\nthat 5G can offer for IoT connections. With 5G, IoT devices\
    \ can connect to the cloud more\nefﬁciently, and each device can use all the resources\
    \ of the cloud, such as storage and\nprocessing power. This feature can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the performance and scalability of\nIoT applications, especially those\
    \ that require large amounts of data processing and storage.\nTable 7. Expectation\
    \ for 5G in IoT.\nFeature\nDescription\nBandwidth\nMore bandwidth to supply applications\
    \ with\nhigh speed.\nAI\nArtiﬁcial intelligence can analyze all the data\ngenerated\
    \ by the IoT devices to take accurate\ndecisions.\nReal-time monitoring and\n\
    management\nThe capability to monitor and manage electronic\ndevices remotely.\n\
    Swarm intelligence\nEach IoT device can be a node, and working with\nother nodes,\
    \ can work as a swarm intelligence.\nQoS\n5G can provide a better QoS in IoT connections.\n\
    Low Latency\n5G reduces the latency, which means that the IoT\ndevices can take\
    \ immediate decisions.\nCloud computing\n5G can provide better connections to\
    \ the cloud,\nwhich means each IoT device can use all the\nresources of the cloud.\n\
    Since smart cities use IoT devices to provide a solution in our daily routine,\
    \ 5G is\nessential in providing a more stable, scalable, and accurate solution,\
    \ with help from other\ntechnologies, such as cloud computing, machine learning,\
    \ and so on. In other words, 5G is\nkey in smart cities because this generation\
    \ optimizes how to transmit and receive data and\nperforms the way to obtain data.\
    \ Based on these data, electronic devices can make accurate\ndecisions after processing.\n\
    Table 8 was divided into parts, in which the ﬁrst part deals exclusively with\
    \ the\ndescription and impact on 5G, and the second part describes cases and ways\
    \ to prevent\nthis interference.\nTable 8. Technologies for the elderly\nInterference\n\
    Description\n5G Impact\nAdjacent Channel\nInterference\nThis occurs when the frequency\
    \ channel of\nour device is overlapped.\nIf we do not have good bandpass ﬁlters,\
    \ there\nwill be interference from nearby frequencies. In\n5G devices, this can\
    \ have a signiﬁcant impact.\nIntra-cell and\ninter-cell\ninterference\nInter-cell\
    \ interference occurs when two\nusers in neighboring cells attempt to use\nthe\
    \ same frequency simultaneously.\nIntra-cell interference occurs when there is\n\
    a simultaneous short-range transmission\nby two BSs, with distortion from the\
    \ user\nand the other equipment in the same cell.\nThis type of interference can\
    \ severely damage 5G\nnetworks because for bases or architectures\nwhere there\
    \ are micro- or macro-cells, the power\nof neighboring signals in both uplink\
    \ and\ndownlink transmission by multiple users can\ninterfere with each other\
    \ [98].\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n29 of 41\nTable 8. Cont.\nInterference\nDescription\n\
    5G Impact\nIntra-Channel and\nInter-Channel\ninterference\nIntra-channel interference\
    \ occurs when\nthere is little power within the macro\nnetwork cell.\nInter-channel\
    \ interference occurs due to the\nproximity of devices when two separate\nfrequencies\
    \ cause interference. As they operate\nat short range, the transmitter of a high-power\n\
    signal causes interference; interference can also\nbe due to the exploration of\
    \ hetnets with OFDM.\nThere are ICI reduction solutions with reverse\nfrequency\
    \ allocation (RFA) employed, which is a\nproactive interference.\nInter-Symbol\n\
    interference\nThis type of interference occurs when one\nor more symbols interfere\
    \ with other\nsymbols.\nIt is caused by phase or amplitude dispersion of\nthe\
    \ channel, which results in signal distortion.\nThis can be clearly seen in OFDMA,\
    \ which\ncauses multipath propagation and impacts\nbandwidth efﬁciency.\nInter-Numerology\n\
    interference\nOccurs when using the numerology system\nfor greater ﬂexibility\
    \ and does not allow\nthe alignment in the time domain to be\nperfect. These misalignments\
    \ or\nimperfections are known as\ninter-numerology interference.\nIn the search\
    \ for higher performance and\nsigniﬁcant bandwidth, using numerology, can\ncause\
    \ interference by having networks with\nmany devices sending signiﬁcant amounts\
    \ of\ninformation, which makes this type of\ninterference more pronounced, affecting\
    \ the\nnetwork’s performance.\nCross-Link\nInterference\nThis type of interference\
    \ occurs when a\ntransmission is made to a neighboring cell\nin different directions\
    \ simultaneously,\neither by arbitrarily overlapping resources\nor by time frequency.\n\
    Cross-link interference can affect 5G networks\ndue to the amount of BS required,\
    \ since incorrect\nhopping can cause performance failures.\nInter-Beam\ninterference\
    \ [99]\nThis occurs when using MIMO technology,\nas this type of array sends RF\
    \ energy in all\ndirections, with the spatial division of the\nmultiple beams\
    \ causing interference.\nAdjacent beams cause this either by the\nsame cell or\
    \ by neighboring cells.\nIt causes interference in applications where\nMIMO antenna\
    \ technology is introduced due to\nthe same usage. When looking for better spectral\n\
    efﬁciency and improvements in network\nperformance, interference from adjacent\
    \ beams\nwithin the same cell or multiple MIMO arrays\nmay negatively inﬂuence\
    \ their neighbors.\nMulti-User\ninterference [100]\nThis occurs when, in MU-MIMO,\
    \ multiple\nusers try to transmit information\nsimultaneously.\nConsidering that\
    \ in 5G, performance and\ninformation forwarding improvements are\nsought, when\
    \ switching to MU-MIMO,\nuncoordinated cells encounter more signiﬁcant\nproblems\
    \ during user management.\nAdjacent Channel\nInterference\nThis occurs when the\
    \ frequency channel of\nthe device is overlapped.\nIf we do not have good bandpass\
    \ ﬁlters, there\nwill be interference from nearby frequencies. In\n5G devices,\
    \ this can have a signiﬁcant impact.\nIt is pertinent to consider how this type\
    \ of interference can affect or impact 5G networks\ntoday, since it must be kept\
    \ in mind with the explosive development of technology. In turn,\nthis can affect\
    \ different 5G architectures, since the main objectives of these networks are\
    \ to\nimprove things such as latency, throughput, transmission speeds, etc.\n\
    Table 9 provides an overview of different types of interference that can occur\
    \ in 5G net-\nworks and their potential impacts on network performance. Adjacent\
    \ Channel Interference\noccurs when the frequency channel of our device is overlapped\
    \ with nearby frequencies,\nleading to interference. Intra-cell and inter-cell\
    \ interference occurs when multiple users\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n30 of 41\n\
    in neighboring cells attempt to use the same frequency simultaneously or when\
    \ there is a\nsimultaneous short-range transmission by two base stations in the\
    \ same cell. This type of\ninterference can severely damage 5G networks, particularly\
    \ in architectures where there\nare micro- or macro-cells. Intra-channel and inter-channel\
    \ interference occurs when there\nis little power within the macro network cell,\
    \ though inter-channel interference can also\noccur due to the proximity of devices\
    \ operating at different frequencies. Inter-Symbol inter-\nference occurs when\
    \ one or more symbols interfere with other symbols, resulting in signal\ndistortion\
    \ due to phase or amplitude dispersion of the channel. Inter-Carrier interference\n\
    occurs when the signal is lost due to an offset between the subcarriers, leading\
    \ to large-scale\nor small-scale fading and variations in the received signal.\
    \ Inter-Numerology interference\noccurs when using the numerology system for greater\

    \ networks has gained signiﬁcant attention due\nto its potential to revolutionize\
    \ the communication industry. One of the areas where 5G\nnetworks are expected\
    \ to have a substantial impact is the IoT services. This literature\nreview article\
    \ aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of 5G networks on IoT\nservices,\
    \ speciﬁcally examining the issue of interference in this type of network and\
    \ its\nrelated technologies.\nAs a result of new technologies in mobile communications,\
    \ 5G can provide a solution\nin a smart city context. Each IoT device can consume\
    \ a reduced bandwidth, but the problem\narises when the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases. For this reason, it is essential to provide\nhigh beam width for\
    \ better communication between IoT devices.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n31 of 41\n\
    The emergence of 5G networks and Internet of Things services has brought about\n\
    a new era of connectivity and transformation to various industries. With the increasing\n\
    number of connected devices, there is a need for a network that can handle the\
    \ massive\ndata transfer, low latency, and high-speed communication required by\
    \ IoT devices. The\nconvergence of 5G networks and IoT services is expected to\
    \ revolutionize the way devices\ncommunicate with each other and the internet.\
    \ In this section, we will critically discuss the\nrelated impact of network and\
    \ service convergence between 5G networks and IoT services.\nOne of the main beneﬁts\
    \ of the convergence of 5G networks and IoT services is the\nability to support\
    \ massive machine-to-machine communication. The integration of 5G\nnetworks with\
    \ IoT devices creates a seamless connection, allowing devices to communicate\n\
    with each other and the internet at high speeds and low latency. This has signiﬁcant\n\
    implications for industries such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing,\
    \ where\nlarge volumes of data need to be transmitted in real time to enable efﬁcient\
    \ operations. For\ninstance, connected cars, trains, and airplanes can communicate\
    \ with each other and other\nconnected devices in real time, leading to improved\
    \ safety and efﬁciency.\nAnother impact of the convergence of 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services is the creation\nof new business models and revenue streams. With\
    \ the increased speed and capacity of\n5G networks, service providers can offer\
    \ new IoT services such as smart homes, smart\ncities, and smart factories. This\
    \ creates an opportunity for service providers to develop new\nbusiness models\
    \ and revenue streams, such as selling data insights, providing managed\nservices,\
    \ and offering customized solutions. For example, telecom operators can offer\n\
    IoT connectivity as a service, which provides businesses with a cost-effective\
    \ and scalable\nmethod to connect and manage their IoT devices.\nHowever, the\
    \ convergence of 5G networks and IoT services also presents some chal-\nlenges\
    \ that need to be addressed. One of the challenges is the issue of security and\
    \ privacy.\nAs the number of connected devices grows, the potential for cyberattacks\
    \ and data breaches\nalso increases. Therefore, service providers and device manufacturers\
    \ need to work to-\ngether to ensure that IoT devices are secure and comply with\
    \ data protection regulations.\nAdditionally, the convergence of 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services requires signiﬁcant invest-\nments in infrastructure and technology.\
    \ Service providers need to deploy a massive number\nof 5G base stations to enable\
    \ reliable and consistent connectivity for IoT devices.\nThe convergence of 5G\
    \ networks and IoT services has the potential to revolutionize the\nway devices\
    \ communicate with each other and the internet. It has signiﬁcant implications\n\
    for industries such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, creating\
    \ new business\nmodels and revenue streams. However, it also presents challenges\
    \ such as security and\nprivacy concerns and the need for signiﬁcant investments\
    \ in infrastructure and technology.\nTherefore, service providers and device manufacturers\
    \ need to work together to address\nthese challenges and ensure that the convergence\
    \ of 5G networks and IoT services leads to\na safer, more efﬁcient, and connected\
    \ world.\nTable 10 discusses the potential positive and negative impacts of integrating\
    \ 5G\ntechnologies with IoT solutions. The table is divided into three columns,\
    \ including Category,\nContext, and Explanation.\nThe ﬁrst category mentioned\
    \ in the table is Positive, which includes three different\ncontexts. The ﬁrst\
    \ context is Cost Optimization, which refers to the potential cost savings\nassociated\
    \ with integrating 5G technologies with IoT solutions. With the help of data\n\
    gathered by devices, businesses and organizations can optimize their processes,\
    \ leading to\nmore cost-effective solutions. Additionally, data-driven decision\
    \ making allows private\nor public entities to make better decisions. For instance,\
    \ a city can use IoT solutions to\noptimize trafﬁc ﬂow, leading to reduced fuel\
    \ consumption and fewer trafﬁc jams.\nThe second context mentioned in the Positive\
    \ category is Improving QoS, which refers\nto the potential improvement in the\
    \ quality of life for citizens. By providing relevant\ninformation and real-time\
    \ control over public infrastructure, cities can positively impact\ncitizens’\
    \ lives. For example, using IoT solutions, a city can improve security by monitoring\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n32 of 41\npublic spaces and providing real-time alerts\
    \ in case of emergencies. Additionally, cities can\ncreate new economic development\
    \ opportunities fueled by the digitalization era.\nThe third context mentioned\
    \ in the Positive category is Reducing climate change. By\nimplementing IoT solutions\
    \ with 5G technologies, businesses can have closer control over\nindustrial processes\
    \ and real-time analytics regarding relevant environmental properties.\nThis can\
    \ be the next step in becoming a more environmentally friendly society.\nMoving\
    \ onto the Negative category, the table mentions two different contexts. The\n\
    ﬁrst context is Digital Non-Inclusion, which refers to the potential negative\
    \ impact of IoT\nsolutions on regions with less access to technological services,\
    \ while 5G and IoT efforts\ncan improve the quality of life of those cities that\
    \ can afford it, they currently do not offer\ncost-effective solutions for regions\
    \ with less access to technological services.\nThe second context mentioned in\
    \ the Negative category is privacy compromises.\nHaving real-time information\
    \ on assets, people, and any living or non-living organism\nin a region can seriously\
    \ threaten privacy violations. Political or social movements can\nnegatively use\
    \ sensible data related to citizens to perform any action.\nTable 10. Explanation\
    \ of the positive or negative impact in 5G and IoT.\nCategory\nContext\nExplanation\n\
    Positive\nCost\nOptimization\nIntegrating 5G technologies with IoT solutions will\n\
    allow for more cost-effective solutions when 5G\ntechnologies reach the mainstream\
    \ market. Optimizing\nprocesses with the data gathered by the devices will\nallow\
    \ for data-driven decision making, allowing\nprivate or public entities to make\
    \ better decisions.\nPositive\nImproving\nQoS\nBy providing relevant information\
    \ and real-time\ncontrol over public infrastructure, citizens will be\npositively\
    \ impacted by reduced trafﬁc, improved\nsecurity, and new economic development\n\

    \ can be the next step in becoming a more\nenvironmentally friendly society.\n\
    Negative\nDigital\nNon-Inclusion\nWhile 5G and IoT efforts can improve the quality\
    \ of\nlife of those cities that can afford it, they currently do\nnot offer cost-effective\
    \ solutions for regions with less\naccess to technological services.\nNegative\n\

    \ Political or social\nmovements can negatively use sensible data related to\n\
    citizens to perform any action.\nFigure 10 discusses the main challenges on 5G\
    \ networks. One of the main challenges\nof 5G networks related to interference,\
    \ IoT devices, and network optimization is the high\ndemand for wireless connectivity\
    \ and data transmission. With the increasing number of\nIoT devices and the exponential\
    \ growth of data usage, 5G networks must be optimized\nto handle the massive amount\
    \ of data transmission while minimizing interference. The\ndeployment of small\
    \ cells and heterogeneous networks is one strategy to increase net-\nwork capacity\
    \ and reduce interference. However, the complexity of network planning,\ndeployment,\
    \ and management increases with the deployment of small cells, which requires\n\
    sophisticated optimization techniques. Additionally, the development of 5G IoT\
    \ devices\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n33 of 41\nwith limited power and processing\
    \ capabilities also presents a challenge. The design of\nlow-power wireless communication\
    \ protocols and efﬁcient resource allocation techniques\nis necessary to optimize\
    \ the performance of IoT devices in 5G networks. 5G networks’\nchallenges related\
    \ to interference, IoT devices, and network optimization require advanced\nsolutions\
    \ and innovative technologies to ensure high-quality wireless connectivity and\n\
    meet the demands of the growing digital ecosystem.\nFigure 10. Challenges of 5G\
    \ networks.\nTable 11 is a representation of the future research challenges in\
    \ 5G that are directly\nrelated to IoT services. It is a ﬁve-column table with\
    \ the following labels for each column:\nFeatures, Advantages, Research Challenges,\
    \ Key Requirements, and Interoperability. The\nFeatures column lists the main\
    \ features that are relevant for IoT services in 5G. In this table,\nthe features\
    \ are IoT Services, Edge Computing, 5G Radio Access, and Network Slicing. The\n\
    Advantages column lists the advantages that 5G can provide to IoT services, for\
    \ example,\nenabling new use cases, reducing latency, providing high data rates,\
    \ and providing cus-\ntomizable networks. The Research Challenges column lists\
    \ the key research challenges that\nneed to be addressed in order to fully realize\
    \ the potential of 5G for IoT services, for exam-\nple, network slicing, security,\
    \ scalability, resource allocation, and spectrum management.\nThe Key Requirements\
    \ column lists the key technical requirements that need to be met in\norder to\
    \ address the research challenges, for example, low latency, high reliability,\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency, and service level agreements. The Interoperability column\
    \ lists the key interoper-\nability issues that need to be addressed in order\
    \ to ensure that different 5G networks and\nIoT devices can work together seamlessly,\
    \ for example, standardization, integration with\nexisting systems, compatibility\
    \ with different technologies, and interoperability between\nnetwork slices.\n\
    Interference can have a signiﬁcant impact on 5G networks, particularly in the\
    \ context\nof Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The large number of IoT devices\
    \ that will be connected\nto 5G networks will inevitably lead to increased interference,\
    \ which can result in degraded\nnetwork performance and poor user experience.\n\
    One of the critical responses to interference in 5G networks is to employ advanced\n\
    signal processing techniques to mitigate the effects of interference. For example,\
    \ beam-\nforming and advanced receiver algorithms can help to reduce interference\
    \ on 5G networks.\nAdditionally, the use of multi-antenna systems and smart antennas\
    \ can improve the quality\nof the received signal and reduce interference.\nAnother\
    \ critical response is to implement interference management protocols that\nenable\
    \ the efﬁcient use of available radio resources. These protocols can help to coordinate\n\
    the use of different channels, reduce interference between neighboring cells,\
    \ and optimize\nthe use of spectrum resources.\nFor instance, the use of small\
    \ cell networks can help to reduce interference by reduc-\ning the distance between\
    \ the transmitter and receiver. In addition, the use of frequency\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 3876\n34 of 41\nreuse techniques, such as fractional frequency reuse, can\
    \ help to mitigate the impact of\ninterference in multi-cell networks.\nTable\

    \ an essential step\ntowards achieving new business opportunities and improving\
    \ connectivity worldwide.\nThe ecosystem of IoT devices is complex, and choosing\
    \ the right primary or complementary\nconnectivity option depends on factors such\
    \ as deployment costs, range, interference,\nand capabilities. Technical studies\
    \ have shown that 5G and other services can coexist in\nspeciﬁc frequency bands,\
    \ provided that the technical conditions are adequately adapted.\nCompliance with\
    \ the permitted exposure limits is also essential when designing new\napplications\
    \ or technological accessories using 5G and IoT.\nThe convergence of networks\
    \ and services, driven by 5G technology, is transforming\nthe internet into a\
    \ complex and multifaceted ecosystem integrated into nearly every aspect\nof our\
    \ daily lives. The availability and speed of access to the internet are increasing,\n\
    allowing users to access high-quality media content in real-time and internet\
    \ service\nproviders to offer a range of new services and applications. Cellular\
    \ connectivity will\nenable the achievement of key IoT goals, such as reducing\
    \ device complexity and cost,\nincreasing coverage to support remote applications,\
    \ and providing deployment ﬂexibility,\nhigh capacity, and long battery life.\n\
    Businesses can beneﬁt greatly from the optimization of network performance in\
    \ 5G\nnetworks, which is essential for adequately functioning business processes,\
    \ improving\nproductivity, reducing downtime, and enhancing customer satisfaction.\
    \ The potential of the\nconvergence of networks and services in increasing the\
    \ availability and speed of access to\nthe internet enables a range of new and\
    \ innovative applications and services, transforming\nthe way we live and work.\n\
    Managing interference in 5G networks is a signiﬁcant challenge in ensuring the\
    \ reli-\nability and performance of IoT services. Effective interference management\

    \ addressed to ensure that 5G networks can\nsupport the massive number of devices\
    \ and applications that rely on them.\n5G has a lot of features necessary for\
    \ smart cities. However, it can be improved by\ncombining it with protocols such\
    \ as LoRaWAN, which provides low-range communication,\nZ-Wave, Zigbee, and SigFox\

    \ have rapidly grown over the past few decades to offer futuristic ap-\nplications,\
    \ such as autonomous vehicles, smart farming, and smart city. Such applications\
    \ require\nubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services\
    \ quickly. Toward this aim,\nsixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers\
    \ superior performance with high reliability, enhanced\ntransmission rate, and\
    \ low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applica-\n\
    tions is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various\
    \ network-related\nattacks (i.e., data injection or modiﬁcation) to jeopardize\
    \ the regular operation of the smart applica-\ntions. Therefore, incorporating\
    \ blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent\nsolution\
    \ to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated\
    \ by the same,\nwe presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes\
    \ the essential characteristics of\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and\
    \ a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime\ndata. The case study\
    \ is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain\n\
    scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy. Lastly, we explored different\
    \ research challenges\nof adopting blockchain in the 6G wireless network.\nKeywords:\
    \ blockchain; 6G network; applications; blockchain services; unmanned aerial vehicle;\
    \ AI\n1. Introduction\nIn the current scenario, humans interact with the physical\
    \ world using sixth-generation\n(6G)-based technologies, such as the Internet\
    \ of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence (AI).\
    \ These technologies monitor the application’s resources and\ncontrol a colossal\
    \ amount of data, power, and storage resources. The advent of IoT technolo-\n\
    gies brings tremendous cognizant applications, such as smart healthcare, smart\
    \ cities, smart\ngrids, etc., to improve people’s standard of living. However,\
    \ the increasing number of\nusers and their network demands, such as high bandwidth\
    \ and low latency, make wireless\ncommunication networks more complex and vulnerable\
    \ to different security and privacy\nissues, such as user identity, authenticity,\
    \ data integrity, information security, and conﬁden-\ntiality [1]. For example,\
    \ in a smart healthcare system, the patient health record is private\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23020969\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n2 of 26\nand sensitive information that must be secured\
    \ from adversaries, which can misuse this\ninformation by tampering with it or\
    \ selling it to the black market. Another example is\nfor public safety applications\
    \ (e.g., IoT-based crime detection), where a criminal tries to\nmodify the central\
    \ repository that holds the criminal records. The adversary can modify or\ntamper\
    \ the criminal records, i.e., it can perform injection attacks to change the criminal’s\n\
    identity (e.g., remove the traces of criminal evidence). Therefore, superior technology\n\
    such as blockchain is required to overcome the aforementioned security issues\
    \ in 6G-based\nsmart applications [2]. It strengthens the security and privacy\
    \ of wireless communication\nnetworks by utilizing its essential characteristics,\
    \ i.e., immutability, scalability, security and\nprivacy, transparency, and decentralization\
    \ [3,4].\nBlockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that builds trust between\
    \ various\nnetwork services and applications such as smart grids, smart agriculture,\
    \ smart cities,\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, and vehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ (V2V) communica-\ntions. It also delivers improved services such as interoperability,\
    \ distribution, immutability,\nfaster settlement, unanimity, and many more. As\
    \ a result, blockchain is associated with a\n6G-based wireless communication network\
    \ and offers a secure and trusted environment for\ndata protection in an IoT-based\
    \ public safety environment. For example, Velliangiri et al. [5]\ndiscussed the\
    \ applicability of blockchain technology with the emerging 6G network for\nsecure\
    \ data sharing. They proposed a privacy-preserving architecture for industrial\
    \ services\nand applications. Then, Bindu et al. [6] discussed the signiﬁcance\
    \ of blockchain in 6G\nwireless communication networks. They studied various applications\
    \ of 6G with security\nand privacy threats and explored blockchain-based solutions\
    \ for smart and industrial IoT-\nbased applications. In [7], the authors used\
    \ blockchain secure storage to store crime images\nby applying watermarking and\
    \ cryptographic blockchain in forensic applications. There\nhas been a lot of\
    \ research work in the ﬁeld of the integration of blockchain in 6G-based\nreal-world\
    \ applications. A detailed explanation of each application is as follows.\n1.1.\
    \ Applications of Blockchain in 6G Network\nThis section presents the role of\
    \ blockchain in 6G-based smart applications such as\nsmart cities, smart manufacturing,\
    \ smart agriculture, V2V communication, UAV communi-\ncations, and smart grid\
    \ (Figure 1).\nSmart city\nSmart healthcare\nSmart manufacturing\nSmart grid\n\
    Smart agriculture\nFigure 1. Applications of blockchain in 6G network.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969\n3 of 26\n1.1.1. Smart Healthcare\nThe healthcare industry is\
    \ an essential sector in the nation’s economic system that\noffers medical services\
    \ to treat patients, promote patients’ health, and increase the quality\nof life\
    \ of individuals. The emerging 6G technology revolutionizes healthcare by changing\n\
    the perception of lifestyle [8]. A smart healthcare system offers better connectivity\
    \ between\npatients and healthcare providers, medical organizations, and IoT-based\
    \ medical devices. It\nprovides a health information platform by adopting 6G-based\
    \ services, such as augmented\nand virtual reality. In addition, healthcare systems\
    \ require the blockchain to securely store\nmedical records and update patient\
    \ data across different platforms in real-time [9,10].\nResearchers enabled blockchain\
    \ technology in 6G-based applications and proposed\nmany solutions for smart healthcare.\
    \ For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients\nsuffering from chronic\
    \ diseases are more at risk than ordinary people because patients with\ndiabetes\
    \ and asthma are more susceptible to coronavirus infection. Therefore, there is\
    \ a\nrequirement to treat these types of patients remotely and offer them emergency\
    \ facilities\nsuch as temperature checks, pulse, and respiratory and O2 monitoring.\
    \ However, remote\ndiagnosis and treatment can be lured by the attacker and cause\
    \ patient data security issues.\nThus, to overcome these issues, blockchain is\
    \ integrated with a healthcare system that\nremotely monitors the health data\
    \ of patients suffering from a chronic disease. In [11],\nthe authors facilitated\
    \ a private blockchain and a solidity-based smart contract that keeps\ntrack of\
    \ patients’ health information. The role of blockchain in their proposed work\
    \ is to\nsecurely analyze patients’ details and store patient health records from\
    \ and to the sensors.\nFurther, in [12], the authors investigated AI with healthcare\
    \ systems and proposed a\nparallel gout diagnosis and treatment system (PGDTS).\
    \ Their proposed system enhances\nthe diagnosis accuracy and the effectiveness\
    \ of medical treatment. After the diagnosis and\ntreatment process, their adopted\
    \ scheme was analyzed and evaluated based on diverse\ntherapeutic regimens, and\
    \ they established parallel execution for real-time optimization of\nhealthcare\
    \ processes. Their integrated blockchain-based PGDTS scheme offers integrity,\n\
    scalability, and security of patients’ data.\n1.1.2. Smart Manufacturing\nIn the\
    \ real-world scenario, massive amounts of data are exchanged between the\ndevices\
    \ for large-scale manufacturing. Therefore, machines have the interaction capability\n\
    to cooperate via the Industrial Internet in the manufacturing industry. In order\
    \ to improve\nthe performance of the entire manufacturing process, machines autonomously\
    \ make local\ndecisions [13]; however, there is a requirement for always-on connectivity,\
    \ a higher data\nrate, more reliability, and ultra-low latency in the manufacturing\
    \ industry. The 6G mobile\ncommunication techniques are developed to target the\
    \ aforementioned manufacturing\nindustrial services; however, there are security\
    \ issues in the manufacturing industry where\na malicious user could tamper with\
    \ the manufacturing data. Therefore, blockchain-based\nnetworks are integrated\
    \ into manufacturing systems that offer cybersecurity guarantees\nvia smart contracts,\
    \ hash functions, digital signatures, and immutable digital ledgers to\ntackle\
    \ security and privacy issues. Recently, Leng et al. [14] incorporated digital\
    \ twins with\ndecentralized permissioned blockchain networks to build better mutual\
    \ trust and data ﬂow\nin manufacturing processes. They proposed a ManuChain prototype\
    \ to realize lower- and\nupper-level intelligence for crowd self-organize and\
    \ holistic optimization. Their proposed\nscheme aided a new value for transforming\
    \ and upgrading manufacturing systems. It also\nenhanced the efﬁciency of the\
    \ manufacturing process.\nRecently, blockchain has been investigated and integrated\
    \ with mobile edge com-\nputing (MEC) to overcome the computational workload.\
    \ It reduces time complexity and\nsigniﬁcantly improves system performance. In\
    \ [15], the authors presented a smart man-\nufacturing system by integrating MEC\
    \ with blockchain technology. They also proposed\na swarm-intelligence-based optimization\
    \ model with numerous tasks that enhance the\nprocessing time. Blockchain offers\
    \ device-level information transmission and manufac-\nturing service transactions\
    \ in their proposed approach. Then, Teng et al. [16] proposed a\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n4 of 26\nsmart manufacturing scheme using distributed ledger technology\
    \ that supports on-demand\nproduction. They introduced a blockchain-embedded smart\
    \ manufacturing system that en-\nhances manufacturing efﬁciency. They investigated\
    \ latency and limited throughput issues\nin the blockchain network. Therefore,\
    \ they proposed a deep Q-network that maximizes\nthe user’s net proﬁt. Their results\
    \ show that their proposed framework is highly scalable.\nIt offers consistency,\
    \ availability, and privacy by incorporating off-chain storage, ledger\nisolation,\
    \ and encryption mechanism.\n1.1.3. Smart City\nSmart city architecture requires\
    \ conventional internet support for information collec-\ntion and transmission;\
    \ however, the transmitted data encounter latency and security issues\ndue to\
    \ the precarious communication link between nodes of the smart city. Therefore,\n\
    6G communication technology plays an essential role in connecting devices such\
    \ as the\nsensor in the IoT environment. However, these devices face authentication\
    \ issues that affect\ncomputational costs, communication overheads, and robustness\
    \ [17]. To mitigate these is-\nsues, blockchain technology offers conﬁdentiality,\
    \ integrity, and availability in IoT-enabled\nsmart devices.\nSeveral researchers\
    \ discussed the security challenges in a smart city context. In [18],\nthe author\
    \ aimed to enhance the data collection and processing in smart city governance.\n\
    Therefore, they introduced a hybrid consortium blockchain framework that encourages\n\
    public engagement in the decision-making process. The proposed approach can tackle\n\
    the collusion attacks from the public veriﬁer’s group. Further, they offered a\
    \ Stackelberg-\ngame-based approach to enable persistent public participation\
    \ in the transaction validation\nprocess. The work in [19] proposed an IoT–fog–cloud\
    \ integrated approach with the inter-\nplanetary ﬁle system (IPFS)-based blockchain\
    \ for IoT-driven smart cities. They presented a\nsecure framework based on two-level\
    \ privacy and an intrusion detection scheme. The ﬁrst\nscheme incorporated a blockchain\
    \ module to secure the IoT information and proposed a\ndimensionality reduction\
    \ technique that transits raw IoT data in a new shape. They applied\na gradient\
    \ boosting anomaly detector approach for intrusion detection. Their results show\n\
    that their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score,\
    \ and precision\ncompared with the conventional intrusion detection scheme. Further,\
    \ Rahman et al. [20]\nincorporated blockchain with the IoT infrastructure and\
    \ proposed an MEC-enabled sharing\neconomy system for mega smart cities. They\
    \ utilized smart contracts for decentralized\nmessaging services and stored IoT\
    \ data in a decentralized repository via edge networks.\n1.1.4. Smart Vehicles\n\
    To establish V2V communication, vehicles must quickly send the vehicular informa-\n\
    tion, comprising number of pedestrians, road conditions, number of vehicles, and\
    \ their\nconditions, to reduce the number of road accidents and enhance road safety.\
    \ However,\nthe scalability of V2V communication increases the security, safety,\
    \ reliability, and trust\nissues of vehicular network users. Therefore, there\
    \ is a requirement for a prominent solu-\ntion to overcome these issues. Blockchain\
    \ is used to manage the ground truth of vehicle\ninformation and offers data authentication\
    \ among vehicles. Many researchers recently\nfocused on blockchain technology\
    \ for V2V communication. Chattaraj et al. [21] integrated\nblockchain with IoT-driven\
    \ smart devices that improve customer safety, ease congestion,\nand pollution\
    \ reduction. For that, they proposed a certiﬁcateless key agreement protocol for\n\
    Internet of vehicles in a smart transportation context (Block-CLAP). The proposed\
    \ scheme\noutperforms the precedent authentication schemes’ security, communication,\
    \ and computa-\ntional overheads.\nFurthermore, Xia et al. [22] integrated blockchain\
    \ with the Internet of vehicles (BIoV)\nand proposed a novel V2V electricity trading\
    \ approach using Bayesian game pricing. They\nutilized a Bayesian game that predicted\
    \ the price in the distributed BIoV with incomplete\ninformation-sharing. In the\
    \ pricing game approach, they applied smart contracts that\nprovide security,\
    \ trust, and reliability for electricity transactions. The results reveal that\
    \ the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n5 of 26\nproposed scheme reduces communication overhead\
    \ and time complexity in the decentral-\nized IoVs compared to the static game.\
    \ Then, in [23], the authors incorporated a blockchain\nnetwork with the vehicles\
    \ that stores real-time information about vehicles, such as relaying,\ntransmitting,\
    \ and receiving data. As a result, the adopted scheme is able to block malicious\n\
    or unauthorized vehicles from participation. Finally, they considered network\
    \ parameters,\nsuch as throughput and error rate analysis (i.e., bit error rate)\
    \ to evaluate their proposed\nscheme. They proved the proposed scheme’s efﬁciency\
    \ and effectiveness by enhancing\nthroughput by 3 bps and decreasing BER by 2\
    \ dB.\n1.1.5. Smart Grid\nA smart grid is introduced to meet people’s higher electricity\
    \ needs and optimize\nresource allocation. The smart grid makes better decisions\
    \ about power and energy-sharing\ndata. It supports management approaches for\
    \ peak energy demand and also reduces energy\nconsumption by exchanging the data\
    \ of energy feedback and power consumption [24].\nHowever, due to the possibility\
    \ of malicious access during information exchange over the\ninsecure communication\
    \ network, multiple entities are unwilling to convey their informa-\ntion to protect\
    \ their data privacy. Moreover, there are various types of cyberattacks in smart\n\
    grid systems, such as session hijacking, nonrepudiation, denial-of-service (DoS),\
    \ ﬂooding,\nspooﬁng, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack [25]. To overcome the\
    \ security and privacy\nissues, smart technology is required that provides trust,\
    \ reliability, and data-sharing secu-\nrity. Many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ as a solution to secure the smart grid. For instance,\nthe authors of [26] presented\
    \ a secure and reliable data exchange scheme by utilizing\nthe processing mode.\
    \ The proposed scheme provides transparency and auditability of\nenergy production,\
    \ pricing, and services in smart grids. They utilized smart contracts to\nauthenticate\
    \ and track the data ﬂow between different blockchain members. Additionally,\n\
    they incorporated a distributed ledger that provides an immutable and transparent\
    \ data\nusage record. As a result, their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of\
    \ payoffs compared\nwith baseline works. Further, Hao et al. [27] focused on the\
    \ efﬁciency and privacy issue in\nthe current electricity trading scheme. Therefore,\
    \ they analyzed a decentralized scheme of\npeer-to-peer electricity trading by\
    \ introducing smart meters. They utilized a blockchain\nwallet for transactions\
    \ and a smart contract to initiate the transmission switch instructions.\nThe\
    \ results revealed that the proposed scheme reduces the cost and latency. Furthermore,\n\
    they offered fast and privacy-aware roaming to prove the proposed scheme’s feasibility\n\
    and efﬁciency.\n1.1.6. Smart Agriculture\nIn the world, agriculture is the largest\
    \ sector of economic activity. With an increasing\nworld population, there is\
    \ a requirement to increase agricultural productivity by adopt-\ning smart technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, robotics, UAV communication, AI, etc., to enhance\nthe quality\
    \ and quantity of agricultural products with minimum human labor. Existing\nwireless\
    \ standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Narrowband IoT\n\
    (NB-IoT), and WiMAX are used for pesticide detection, soil sensing, smart irrigation,\
    \ crop\nrecommendations, and plant protection. They prevent forest ﬁres and offer\
    \ safety to crops\nfrom pests [28]. However, the aforementioned technologies face\
    \ an issue when a consid-\nerable amount of agricultural data is accumulated in\
    \ real-time. In addition, population\ngrowth and environmental effects such as\
    \ climate change, temperature, rainfall, etc., af-\nfect the agriculture system.\
    \ Therefore, emerging 6G wireless communication technology\nand its speciﬁc application\
    \ scenarios are introduced in agriculture, providing intelligent,\nunmanned, and\
    \ automatic agricultural production and cultivation by offering high-speed\nconnectivity\
    \ between smart devices.\nSmart agriculture systems require transparency and commercial\
    \ security for the food\ndata [29]. Therefore, many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ technology in the agricultural ﬁeld\nto provide security, reliability, transparency,\
    \ and privacy of agricultural data. For example,\nVangala et al. [30] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based smart contract that includes a key agree-\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n6 of 26\nment approach to mitigate the risk of data integrity attacks\
    \ in smart farming systems. Their\nproposed scheme utilizes a robust authentication\
    \ method between two IoT devices. Simi-\nlarly, another authentication phase is\
    \ utilized between an IoT device and the gateway node\nto offer endogenous security.\
    \ Furthermore, they proposed a hybrid blockchain to store the\ntrading transactions\
    \ between different components of the agriculture ecosystem, pesticide\nusage,\
    \ and quality and quantity of fertilizers. The results revealed that the adopted\
    \ scheme\noutperforms in terms of computational time compared to the existing\
    \ authentication proto-\ncols. Then, Yang et al. [31] focused on centralized,\
    \ opaque, and untrustworthy data storage\nissues for horticulture products. To\
    \ overcome the aforementioned issues, they introduced\na traceability system (e.g.,\
    \ on- and off-chain traceability) using a dual storage within the\nblockchain.\
    \ They utilized cryptography-based elliptic curves with blockchain for safe data\n\
    sharing. Moreover, they proposed a reputation-based smart contract to upload traceability\n\
    information from the node. Their simulation results enhance efﬁciency and guarantee\
    \ the\nagriculture data’s reliability, security, and authenticity.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the aforesaid applications require superlative care from criminal activi-\n\
    ties, natural calamities (e.g., ﬁre, earthquake, etc.), terrorist attacks, and\
    \ riots. For example,\nif a person driving a smart vehicle meets with a road accident,\
    \ it can use V2V communica-\ntion to share this information with the emergency\
    \ medical response team. Similarly, UAV\ncommunication can assist V2V communication\
    \ in sharing this information with nearby hos-\npitals to provide emergency medical\
    \ care. Another scenario is where smart manufacturing\nrequires on-site maintenance\
    \ to clean and repair various critical equipment of the manu-\nfacturing organization.\
    \ This is challenging for a person to perform on-site maintenance\nbecause the\
    \ manufacturing vessels and equipment are highly hazardous (i.e., radioactive)\n\
    to human health. Further, a criminal attempt to commit a crime (e.g., stealing,\
    \ murder,\nkidnapping, etc.) in the smart city must be captured under the jurisdiction.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe government and local organizations must offer an emergency response,\
    \ disaster risk\nmanagement, and criminal investigation teams under the umbrella\
    \ of public safety applica-\ntions to protect the wellbeing of the nation’s citizens\
    \ who are using the abovementioned\napplications. However, it is observed from\
    \ the literature review that public safety applica-\ntions are highly insecure\
    \ from the perspective of security and privacy. These applications\nstill use\
    \ legacy software and tools and utilize a centralized repository for data storage\
    \ that\nthe attackers can lure. Moreover, as these applications are mission-critical,\
    \ they require\nlow latency and high data rate communication to offer proactive\
    \ services; however, many\npublic safety applications still use traditional network\
    \ interfaces (e.g., 3G and 4G) that\ndegrade their performance.\n1.2. Motivation\n\
    The motivation behind this work is given as follows.\n•\nMost of the existing\
    \ literature focuses on the role of blockchain in 6G-based appli-\ncations; however,\
    \ there are a few research articles available in which the authors\nstudied the\
    \ drivers, enablers, security requirements, and applicability of blockchain in\n\
    6G-based smart applications.\n•\nFrom the literature review, we observed that\
    \ no comprehensive work exists that\nconsiders the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of IoT-based public safety applications\nusing blockchain technology.\n•\nThus,\
    \ there is a stringent requirement to provide exhaustive work on the applicability\n\
    of blockchain in IoT-based public safety applications underlying a 6G network.\n\
    1.3. Research Contributions\nThis article presents the role of the blockchain\
    \ in a 6G-based IoT-enabled public safety\napplication. We also emphasize how\
    \ blockchain provides security and privacy in 6G\nservices. Moreover, the paper\
    \ shows the amalgamation of blockchain in 6G communication\nnetworks to strengthen\
    \ the security and communication of public safety applications. Based\non that,\
    \ the following are the signiﬁcant contributions of this research article.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969\n7 of 26\n•\nThrough this article, we propose a detailed work\
    \ on the applicability of blockchain\nin a 6G network. We also analyze the 6G-based\
    \ smart applications and discuss how\nblockchain features provide trust, security,\
    \ authenticity, conﬁdentiality, and privacy.\n•\nWe explore different 6G-network-based\
    \ services and discuss the inﬂuence of blockchain\nin delivering 6G-based services\
    \ to various smart applications.\n•\nWe consider a blockchain- and 6G-based case\
    \ study for public safety applications to\nshowcase the adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology in the 6G network interface. Further,\nthe case study is assessed\
    \ by considering blockchain scalability, 6G latency, and AI\nstatistical measures\
    \ parameters.\n•\nLastly, we perform an in-depth analysis and identify the research\
    \ challenges of the\nadoption of blockchain in the 6G network to motivate the\
    \ researchers working on the\nsame domain.\n2. Related Works\nIn the previous\
    \ section, we discussed various blockchain-based 6G applications such\nas smart\
    \ healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, smart manufacturing, etc. After study-\n\
    ing these real-world applications in detail, we identiﬁed that public safety is\
    \ an essential\ndomain that requires more security attention. Various researchers\
    \ consider public safety\napplications and offered security and privacy approaches\
    \ for road safety, criminal activity\nmonitoring, on-site safety, etc. They deal\
    \ with data security, person authentication, infor-\nmation conﬁdentiality, and\
    \ integrity issues. For example, Ihinosen et al. [32] addressed the\ndynamic ridesharing\
    \ issue in public transport systems. They proposed GPS tracking and a\ntwo-way\
    \ rating system using the mobile application’s facial recognition module.\nIn\
    \ the aforementioned work, the researchers incorporated different security mech-\n\
    anisms using mobile applications and cryptographic primitives. However, they are\
    \ yet\nto consider data consistency, traceability, and scalability. Therefore,\
    \ Xu et al. [33] uti-\nlized various technologies such as blockchain, IoT, edge,\
    \ fog, and cloud computing for\nsmart public safety. They proposed the BLockchain-ENabled\
    \ Decentralized Microservices\nArchitecture for Smart public safety, named BlendMAS,\
    \ scheme that offers security and\ndata access control for the public safety system.\
    \ Then, in [34], Fitwi et al. worked on the\nsafety and security of video surveillance\
    \ systems. They proposed edge computing and a\nsmart-contract-based lightweight\
    \ privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme that identiﬁes the\nfugitives using their\
    \ facial features. Makhdoom et al. [35] proposed a smart-contract-based\ncollaborative\
    \ intrusion detection system that prevents cyberattack and data theft. Their\n\
    proposed scheme manages the trust between the nodes and prevents the input false\
    \ attack\nin the IDS.\nFurthermore, Wu et al. [36] focused on the on-site safety\
    \ issue due to the equipment\ndefects and environmental hazards for tower crane\
    \ safety management. They proposed\na blockchain-based framework utilizing Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric that offers security and au-\nthenticity with trust at the construction\
    \ site. Moreover, Yu et al. [37] addressed data\nvulnerability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ privacy, and the centralized key storage issue of the IIoT data\nstorage applications.\
    \ To overcome this problem, they proposed a Shamir threshold cryp-\ntography scheme\
    \ with blockchain called STCChain that offers availability, accountability,\n\
    and integrity of the data. Then, Na et al. [38] proposed a blockchain-enabled\
    \ access control\nscheme using multisignature that protects autonomous vehicle\
    \ data. They collected and\nstored vehicle data using a dashboard camera and global\
    \ positioning system. Their ﬁndings\nshowed that the proposed scheme offers data\
    \ privacy and security with lower veriﬁcation\ntime and latency. Table 1 shows\
    \ the comparative analysis of existing works for public safety\napplications by\
    \ incorporating security, 6G network with their objective, pros, and cons.\nFrom\
    \ the overall study, we observed that many researchers carried out a lot of research\n\
    work in the security ﬁeld for smart public safety applications. In most papers,\
    \ the research\ncommunity focuses on the role of different security approaches,\
    \ such as cryptographic and\nmobile applications. However, very few of them incorporated\
    \ blockchain-based security in\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n8 of 26\npublic safety\
    \ applications. Therefore, we included a blockchain-based security approach\n\
    using 6G wireless communication in the public safety application domain.\nTable\

    \ of the research article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature\n\
    review of the state-of-the-art works. Section 3 presents blockchain-based 6G services\
    \ such\nas network slicing, spectrum sharing, data sharing, and resource management.\
    \ In Section 4,\nwe proposed layer-wise architecture for IoT-based public safety\
    \ application. Section 5\ndiscusses the results and analysis of the proposed case\
    \ study. Then, we discuss various\nchallenges of the adoption of blockchain in\
    \ 6G network in Section 6. Finally, Section 7\nprovides the conclusion.\n3. Role\
    \ of Blockchain in 6G Services\nThis section provides insights on the 6G-based\
    \ smart services, such as network slicing,\nspectrum sharing, resource management,\
    \ and data sharing. Table 2 shows the comparative\nstudy on blockchain-based existing\
    \ 6G services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n9 of 26\n3.1. Network Slicing\nNetwork\
    \ slicing allows to create different virtual networks, where each network\nposes\
    \ different network services from the physical networks infrastructure. This is\
    \ made\npossible by integrating technologies, such as software-deﬁned network\
    \ (SDN) and network\nfunctions virtualization (NFV), that divide single network\
    \ connections into multiple distinct\nvirtual connections. It delivers virtual\
    \ applications that are directly deployed on the\nslice for instant service delivery\
    \ to the users. As an outcome, mobile applications that\nare running on slices\
    \ have large-scale connections and low-latency services with a high-\nquality\
    \ user experience. Network slices reduce the network complexity by virtualization\n\
    and add automation to a complex network. However, it faces issues in dynamic slice\n\
    creation, resource sharing, wireless resource virtualization, and data security.\
    \ To mitigate\nthe aforementioned issues, blockchain is integrated with network\
    \ slicing to provide user\ntrust, transparency, and privacy. Many researchers\
    \ integrate blockchain as a service in\nnetwork slicing. For example, Abdulqadder\
    \ et al. [39] focused on user authentication,\nload imbalance, and inappropriate\
    \ network slicing issues in an edge-assisted 6G network.\nInitially, they designed\
    \ a deep-learning-based adversarial network that predicts the efﬁcient\nnetwork\
    \ slices and communication links based on the slice capacity, priority, and quality-of-\n\
    service (QoS) demands for data transmission. Further, they applied DAG-based blockchain\n\
    using the proof-of-space approach to enhance the scalability and overcome more\
    \ resource\nconsumption issues. Moreover, they introduced a soft actor–critic\
    \ scheme for load balancing\nin the SDN controller. Finally, the paper concluded\
    \ that the adopted scheme reduces\nhandover latency, packet loss rate, and data\
    \ transmission delay and enhances the system\nthroughput and different attack\
    \ detection rate.\nHe et al. in [40] integrated a multidomain network slice orchestration\
    \ framework with\na blockchain-based CoNet consensus algorithm for data consistency,\
    \ scalability, and security.\nFurther, they proposed a game-theory-based bilateral\
    \ evaluation approach that provides\nsystem fairness with a QoS guarantee. The\
    \ ﬁndings showed that the adopted scheme\nprovides users’ data security and privacy\
    \ with high throughput and low latency. Then,\nChen et al. [41] formulated a blockchain-based\
    \ optical network slicing scheme for IoT\napplications. They focused on the users’\
    \ data security and trust issues while they utilized\nIoT services. The results\
    \ showed that their presented scheme is able to complete slicing\ntransactions\
    \ with a high-quality dedicated communication network.\n3.2. Spectrum Sharing\n\
    The explosive growth of bandwidth-intensive Internet applications such as live\
    \ audio\nand video streaming, web conferencing, big data processing, etc., requires\
    \ high-speed\nnetwork access with a higher frequency spectrum. The 6G wireless\
    \ technology provides\nhigh-speed network access with ultra-reliable low-latency\
    \ communication (URLLC) using\na higher-frequency spectrum [42]. However, it also\
    \ increases congestion and interference in\nthe communication network. To overcome\
    \ this issue, it is required to share the spectrum\nproperly that enhances communication\
    \ capacity and spectrum efﬁciency. Spectrum sharing\naims to efﬁciently use scarce\
    \ natural resources to ensure fairness between mobile users.\nThere are two types\
    \ of methods for spectrum sharing: static and dynamic spectrum sharing.\nOut of\
    \ these two spectrum-sharing mechanisms, dynamic spectrum sharing is the most\n\
    adopted method; it provides feasible, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient spectrum management\
    \ based on\ncognitive radio technology [43,44]. The variety of spectrum bands\
    \ and the rivalry between\ndifferent mobile network operators are the challenges\
    \ in the 6G spectrum sharing. Af-\nter lots of research, many solutions were proposed\
    \ in [45,46] for efﬁcient spectrum sharing;\nhowever, the solutions that address\
    \ the spectrum scarcity problem face issues such as single\npoint of failure,\
    \ malicious activity from unauthorized users, and security concerns.\nTo mitigate\
    \ the aforementioned issue, many researchers incorporate blockchain with\n6G technology,\
    \ which improves security and system performance [47]. For example,\nLiu et al.\
    \ [48] integrated AI with blockchain for radio spectrum resource allocation in\n\
    6G-based enhanced URLLC service. They focused on resource scheduling, classiﬁcation,\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n10 of 26\nand neural network optimization issues between\
    \ IoT devices. For that, they proposed a re-\ninforcement learning approach with\
    \ a blockchain-integrated hybrid cloud. Their presented\nscheme uses uniﬁed coding\
    \ and identiﬁcation standards to build a public management\nplatform to register\
    \ and manage IoT device information. The ﬁndings reveal that the\nadopted scheme\
    \ effectively increases spectrum utilization with security and reliability.\n\
    Further, in [49], the authors presented a blockchain-based user-autonomy spectrum-sharing\n\
    framework that efﬁciently manages the heterogeneous devices of the IoT network.\
    \ They\ndesigned a swarm intelligence approach and a dynamic tip selection algorithm\
    \ to enhance\nthe system and global utility. The simulation results revealed that\
    \ the proposed scheme\nminimizes the average waiting time of transactions and\
    \ power consumption. Moreover, it\nenhances global utility, throughput, and spectral\
    \ efﬁciency. Then, Manogaran et al. [50]\npresented a blockchain-based security\
    \ solution for access control and preserving the data\nprivacy of users’ resources.\
    \ Furthermore, they introduced a Q-learning approach with\nmachine-type communication\
    \ (MTC) that enhanced the performance in the 6G environ-\nment. Compared to the\
    \ existing schemes, their proposed scheme outperformed in terms of\nthe success\
    \ ratio, access time modiﬁcation, time complexity, and memory utilization.\n3.3.\
    \ Data Sharing\nThe 6G-based smart applications such as UAV communication, aerial\
    \ base stations,\nsatellite communication, V2V communication, etc., offer real-time\
    \ data-sharing features\nover the Internet through a mobile communication network.\
    \ Moreover, an increasing\nnumber of social media applications, such as Twitter,\
    \ Facebook, Instagram, etc., and web\nconferencing applications, such as Webex,\
    \ Google Meet, Zoom, etc., require content delivery\nin real-time. These applications\
    \ generate a colossal amount of audio, video, text, and image\ndata. To control\
    \ and share a large scale of data requires an efﬁcient data-sharing scheme\nthat\
    \ overcomes data leakage and security threats. Decentralized blockchain technology\n\
    offers traceability, security, privacy, tamper-resistance, transparency, and immutability\
    \ to\nhandle data-sharing issues in the 6G network. Khowaja et al., in [51], aimed\
    \ to offer a secure\nand reliable data-exchange scheme using a private blockchain,\
    \ i.e., Hyperledger Fabric\nfor vehicular networks. Additionally, they developed\
    \ a deep-learning-based autoencoder\nsegmentation approach that gathers the vehicles\
    \ based on their similarity. The proposed\ndata-sharing scheme achieved better\
    \ throughput, CPU utilization, efﬁciency, applicability,\ncomputational overhead,\
    \ and time complexity.\nFurther, Zhang et al. [52] combined permissioned blockchain\
    \ with federated learning\n(FL) and proposed a channel-based distributed data-sharing\
    \ scheme for data sharing and\npreserving the privacy of the user. Moreover, they\
    \ proposed a data storage scheme using on-\nand off-chain data storage for authenticating\
    \ identity, data, and transactions. The adopted\nscheme enhanced data sharing\
    \ and security, improved data model quality, and prevented\nmalicious attacks.\
    \ Then, in [53], the authors proposed a concrete access control mechanism\nfor\
    \ vehicular communication (vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)). For that, they integrated\n\
    blockchain with ciphertext-enabled attribute encryption (CP-ABE) for user and\
    \ data storage\nidentity management. Further, they enhanced the security mechanism\
    \ and designed the\nadvanced attributed algorithm that minimizes the lightweight\
    \ device’s computational\npressure in VANET. The ﬁndings show that the proposed\
    \ scheme provides effective data\nsecurity with low performance overhead.\n3.4.\
    \ Resource Management\nThe most important service in a 6G wireless communication\
    \ system is utilizing various\nmobile resources such as memory, bandwidth, power,\
    \ and channel. However, managing\nthese resources and fulﬁlling user demands,\
    \ such as on-demand service and real-time visi-\nbility, is critical. Moreover,\
    \ an increasing number of smart applications, such as smart cities,\nsmart homes,\
    \ e-healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, autonomous vehicle, holographic\n\
    communication, etc., require real-time access to various resources. Therefore,\
    \ resource uti-\nlization, allocation, and management are required based on user\
    \ needs. Many researchers\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n11 of 26\nhave proposed efﬁcient\
    \ and optimal resource allocation schemes [54–57]; however, these\nschemes are\
    \ centralized, where a single authority veriﬁes the user and allocates resources\n\
    as per their need. They face various security threats, such as user identity,\
    \ information\nconﬁdentiality, malicious attacks, and a single point of failure.\
    \ Blockchain is considered to\nbe a promising technology to address the abovementioned\
    \ issues. For example, Li et al.,\nin [58], integrated blockchain with MEC-based\
    \ IoT applications to enhance the performance\nof network attributes and ensure\
    \ data-sharing authenticity. They presented the cloud–edge\ncollaborative resource\
    \ allocation mechanism by introducing a collective reinforcement\nlearning (CRL)\
    \ scheme. The authors jointly optimized the data ofﬂoading, blockchain node\n\
    intervals, and transmit power to enhance the energy efﬁciency of the proposed\
    \ scheme.\nIn [59], the authors incorporated blockchain technology with the Internet\
    \ of Every-\nthing (IoE) applications. They proposed a blockchain-enabled metaheuristic\
    \ approach\nfor resource allocation in a cyber twin-driven 6G-IoE environment.\
    \ Additionally, they\ndesigned an optimal resource allocation algorithm using\
    \ graph clustering based on a quasi-\noppositional search and rescue optimization\
    \ approach. Their ﬁndings showed that the\nproposed work reduced average system\
    \ cost to 2.63 and power consumption to 0.012 mW\ncompared to the predeﬁned work.\
    \ Further, Yang et al. [60] intended to optimize the In-\ndustrial IoT device’s\
    \ energy allocation by reducing energy consumption and computation\noverhead.\
    \ Therefore, they incorporated blockchain with IIoT systems and proposed a deep\n\
    Q-learning (DQL)-enabled optimization framework that ensures data security and\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with existing approaches,\
    \ and it\nperforms better in terms of the computation overhead and weighted cost.\n\

    \ for public safety scenarios such as ﬁre incidents,\nroad accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity. Figure 2 shows ﬁve layers of the proposed architecture,\ni.e., data,\

    13 of 26\n4.1. Data Layer\nIn this layer, we considered different emergency services,\
    \ such as ﬁre incidents, road\naccidents, and criminal activity, which require\
    \ faster communication to deliver sensitive\ninformation (e.g., road accidents\
    \ and medical emergencies) to the entities of the applica-\ntion layers. Here,\
    \ UAVs are incorporated to monitor the abovementioned scenarios and\ncollect data\
    \ from them to assist in making a decisive decision for different public safety\n\
    applications. For instance, if a criminal attempts to perform a crime at a particular\
    \ location,\nthe UAVs collect the data from the location and forward it to the\
    \ nearby police station.\nHowever, the criminal can hire an attacker to perform\
    \ adversarial attacks on the collected\ndata to avoid legal protection. An attacker\
    \ can perform different network-related attacks to\nexploit the crime data stored\
    \ in the central repository of police stations. Therefore, there is a\nrequirement\
    \ for an intelligent and automated approach that can seamlessly detect nefarious\n\
    patterns in the network and eradicate it from the public safety environment.\n\
    4.2. Intelligence Layer\nIn this layer, we apply different machine learning (ML)\
    \ classiﬁers that classify the data\ninto attack and nonattack categories. As\
    \ discussed in the data layer, UAVs collect data from\nvarious application scenarios\
    \ and store that data in comma-separated value (CSV) ﬁles.\nThe feature space\
    \ of the dataset is discussed as follows.\n4.2.1. Dataset Description\nIn that\
    \ direction, ﬁrst, we collect the criminal activity dataset from the Kaggle [61]\n\
    that classiﬁes the data into attack and nonattack from the criminal’s behavior.\
    \ However,\nthe collected dataset is not enough to identify the attack or nonattack\
    \ category; therefore, we\naccumulate more data from different sources having\
    \ relevant criminal activity information.\nThe ﬁnal dataset Ψ consists of different\
    \ attributes such as location, crime type, weapon type,\na weapon used or not,\
    \ etc. It has n rows, a1, a2, a3, . . . , an and m columns, b1, b2, b3, . . .\
    \ , bm.\na1, a2, a3, . . . , an ∈ Ψ\n(1)\nb1, b2, b3, . . . , bn ∈ Ψ\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ n is the total count of row 1575 and m is the total count of column 9. The collected\n\
    dataset is stored in the comma-separated values (CSV) ﬁle and further passed to\
    \ the next\nlayer, which is the intelligence layer. Here, there is a risk of data\
    \ modiﬁcation on the judicial\ndata collected from the aforementioned critical\
    \ application scenarios. Therefore, there is a\nneed for data security that protects\
    \ sensitive data from malicious threats.\n4.2.2. ML Classiﬁcation Approach\nThe\
    \ CSV ﬁle has missing values, noise, and unmanaged data columns that affect the\n\
    performance of the ML classiﬁer. To overcome this issue, we replace the missing\
    \ value\nwith central tendency, i.e., mean value. Further, the dataset has numeric\
    \ and textual values\n(alphanumeric), such as location, crime, and weapon types;\
    \ therefore, there is a need to\nconvert nonnumerical data into numeric data.\
    \ We apply the label-encoding technique Le\nthat assigns a numerical value to\
    \ each categorical value.\n∀b3, b4, b5\napply\n−−−→ Le ∈ Ψ\n(3)\nAfter reading\
    \ the CSV ﬁle, we realize that the dataset attributes have different datatype\n\
    D, such as an object, int, and ﬂoat. However, certain ML classiﬁers do not recognize\n\
    attributes with object datatype. To overcome this issue, we change the datatype\
    \ from\nﬂoating to the int using the astype() function.\n∀b7, b8\nchange\n−−−−→\
    \ D\n(4)\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n14 of 26\nThen, we analyze outliers that corrupt\
    \ the dataset and mislead the ML classiﬁers for\nthe wrong classiﬁcation. For\
    \ that, we apply outlier detection techniques that normalize\nthe data using a\
    \ standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or\nlosing\
    \ information. Various normalization approaches exist, such as min-max, standard-\n\
    ization scaling, and Z-score. Here, we apply the min-max method that is mathematically\n\
    represented as follows.\nϑ\n′ =\nϑ − ϑmin\nϑmax − ϑmin\n(5)\nThis normalization\
    \ technique obtains all the scaled data into the range of 0 to 1.\nAfter preprocessing\
    \ the data, we split the data into two classes, training and testing, where\n\
    we train 80% of the data and validate 20% of the data. We pass the training dataset\
    \ (ΨT1)\ninto the ML classiﬁer that classiﬁes the data into attack (1) and nonattack\
    \ (0) categories.\nΨT1\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n−−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(6)\nAfter\
    \ training the model, we feed the testing dataset (ΨT2) into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that\nvalidates the results based on the ΨT1.\nΨT2\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n\
    −−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(7)\nHere, we applied different ML classiﬁers, such as XGBoost,\
    \ random forest (RF), k-\nnearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and\
    \ support vector machine (SVM),\nthat classify the data into attack and nonattack.\
    \ Among all these classiﬁers, we obtained\nthe best results in terms of the accuracy\
    \ and log loss score from the XGBoost algorithm.\nThe XGBoost classiﬁer gives\
    \ effective results with the larger dataset. In this classiﬁer,\nthe data are\
    \ considered for each tree, and we can increase the depth of the tree and decrease\n\
    the min_child_weight that handles the overﬁtting issue in the dataset. The classiﬁed\
    \ data\nare susceptible, which raises the security issue in a public safety application.\
    \ To overcome\nthis issue, we utilize the IPFS-based blockchain network that offers\
    \ the data’s authentication\nand conﬁdentiality, preventing fraud on the dataset.\n\
    4.3. Blockchain Layer\nBlockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology\
    \ that keeps immutable\nrecords of transactions. This layer provides security\
    \ to the classiﬁed data by storing them in\na shared and transparent ledger that\
    \ is only accessible to the authorized network members.\nHere, the data are recorded\
    \ as a block in a blockchain network through the smart contract\n(Sc). Here, a\
    \ smart contract is an agreement between the contract creator and recipient that\n\
    executes automatically when all parties can be sure of the conclusion [10]. Then,\
    \ to provide\na reliable connection between contract and storage, there is an\
    \ interplanetary ﬁle system\n(IPFS) that offers efﬁcient storage and is able to\
    \ share a large ﬁle.\ndata\npass\n−−→ Sc\n(8)\nSc\nStoredata\n−−−−−→ I f\n(9)\n\
    where I f is an IPFS ﬁle system that utilizes content-addressing that uniquely\
    \ retrieves\neach ﬁle in the blockchain network. It stores the data in the blockchain\
    \ network using a\ndistributed hash table (HT). Each stored ﬁle is allocated a\
    \ unique hash value according to\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n15 of 26\nthe content\
    \ of the ﬁle. The mathematical representation of the aforementioned entity is\n\
    as follows.\nI f\ngenerate\n−−−−→ {H1, H1, . . . , Hn} store\n−−→ HT\n(10)\nHT\n\
    add\n−−→ {Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\n(11)\n{Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\
    \ ∈ Blockchainn\n(12)\nHere, different authorized users such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority, and po-\nlice retrieve the secure data.\n4.4. Application\
    \ Layer\nThis layer includes different authorities such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority,\nand police for ﬁre incidents, road accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity, respectively. This\nauthority uses the classiﬁed data for further\
    \ analysis, prediction, and research purposes.\nFor the proposed architecture,\
    \ we considered a criminal behavior dataset that has the crime\nlocation, crime\
    \ type, weapon used, weapon type, etc., attributes that classify the data into\n\
    attack (class 1) or nonattack (class 0). These data will be stored in the IPFS-based\
    \ blockchain.\nFrom that, the police department or any government-regularized\
    \ authority can access\nthe data securely. The advantage of this layer is that\
    \ the public safety regulatory body\n(e.g., emergency response team) acquires\
    \ the attack-free data. This is because the proposed\narchitecture prohibits any\
    \ data injection attacks on secure data storage (blockchain); even if\nthe attackers\
    \ perform any attack on the data storage, it will be known by each blockchain\n\
    participant due to the transparency features of the blockchain technology. Thus,\
    \ the\nproposed architecture offers robust security and reliable communication\
    \ for IoT-based\npublic safety applications.\n4.5. Communication Layer\nThis layer\
    \ comprises the relation between all four layers. We collected criminal\nactivity\
    \ data from the data layer that are further passed to the intelligence layer.\
    \ The data\nwere preprocessed in the intelligence layer and fed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that classiﬁes\nthem into the attack and nonattack classes. The classiﬁed data\
    \ are sensitive to security\nthreats and require immutable and secure storage.\
    \ For that, we store those data in the\ndecentralized and secure IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ layer. In the application layer, authorized\nusers, such as employees from the\
    \ ﬁre department, hospital, and police, access the data\nusing their smartphones,\
    \ tablet, laptop, or other 6G-based gadgets. They all need a strong\ncommunication\
    \ channel with a high data rate and low latency with secure and relevant\ndata\
    \ analysis. Moreover, the data layer to the blockchain layer is synchronized using\
    \ a\npipeline via the 6G network interface. Here, the data coming from the blockchain\
    \ layer\nare ﬁrst converted into the digital signal using a Bernoulli binary digital\
    \ converter and\nthen forwarded into a transmitter block. Here, for the simulation,\
    \ we considered MATLAB-\nbased 5G toolbox that offers certain parameters, such\
    \ as frequency range, modulation\ntechniques, channel impairments, sub-carrier\
    \ spacing, and bandwidth. By modifying these\nparameters, we can mimic the behavior\
    \ of 5G interface to 6G interface. We used a frequency\nrange of 75–110 GHz (operational\
    \ frequency—95 GHz) which is a potential frequency\nrange for beyond 5G speciﬁed\
    \ by the [62], sub-carrier spacing of 240 KHz, and modulation\nwas orthogonal\
    \ frequency division multiplexing (OFDMA), with polar coding for error\ndetection\
    \ and correction. The main aim is not to simulate the 6G network for the speciﬁed\n\
    problem formulation but to use essential properties of the 6G network. This is\
    \ because\nthe 6G simulation is not yet open-sourced by the scientiﬁc community;\
    \ therefore, we have\nto rely on a 5G simulation setup to impersonate the behavior\
    \ of the 6G network. Here,\nthe 6G network interface takes the stored data from\
    \ the blockchain layer and transmits\nthem to the application layer via a 6G network.\
    \ Thus, data, intelligence, and blockchain\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n16 of 26\n\
    layers cumulatively act as a sender that intends to share the data to the application\
    \ layer\nvia adopting 6G communication for faster and reliable communication.\n\
    5. Result and Discussion\nThis section highlightsexperimentation details and results\
    \ analysis of the proposed\narchitecture in terms of accuracy, log loss score,\
    \ and validation curve.\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nThe proposed architecture utilizes\
    \ a Google Colaboratory notebook for developing\nan intelligence layer that uses\
    \ ML classiﬁers, Remix integrated development environment\n(IDE) for the blockchain\
    \ layer, and MATLAB 2022a for the communication layer. The Google\nColaboratory\
    \ notebook is a web IDE for Python programming that uses various Python\nlibraries\
    \ such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Scipy for the ML classiﬁers.\n\
    To simulate the working of the intelligent layer, we incorporated the Google Colaboratory\n\
    notebook that uses ML classiﬁers and provides the classiﬁcation of the data. Here,\
    \ different\nML classiﬁers, such as XGboost, RF, KNN, LR, and SVM, have hyperparameters\
    \ that tailor\nthe classiﬁers’ behavior and improve performance. Table 3 depicts\
    \ the parameters used in\nthe proposed architecture. Here, n_estimators, learning_rate,\
    \ and max_depth are used for\nthe XGBoost classiﬁer, where n_estimators represents\
    \ the tree’s count. Then, learning_rate is\nused as the regularization parameter\
    \ that shows the step size, and the max_depth parameter\ncontrols the overﬁtting\
    \ in the model. The RF classiﬁer used n_estimators value of 200 and\nmax_depth\
    \ value of 1. Moreover, KNN uses the n_neighbors parameter to show the total\n\
    count of neighbors that are utilizedby default for the k-neighbors queries. Furthermore,\n\
    the uniform weights specify that all points are equally weighted in each neighborhood.\
    \ The\nLR classiﬁer uses random_state that shufﬂes the data and the “lbfgs” solver\
    \ with max_iter\nthat uses the solvers to converge. For the SVM classiﬁer, we\
    \ use different parameters such\nas gamma, probability, and kernel. Here, we use\
    \ rbf and linear kernel with the kernel\ncoefﬁcient value such as gamma = “auto”,\
    \ which means 1/n_f eatures.\nTable 3. Parameters of the proposed architecture.\n\

    Network\nRinkeby’s\nEnvironment\nRemix VM\nThe classiﬁed data have sensitive and\
    \ conﬁdential information and require secure\nstorage. Therefore, the classiﬁed\
    \ data are stored in the IPFS-based blockchain network\nusing a smart contract\
    \ in the blockchain layer. The smart contract is implemented using\nsolidity language\
    \ on the Remix IDE with different functions, such as criminal behaviors()\nto\
    \ identify the criminal, weapon() to determine the crime type, addlocation() to\
    \ know\nthe crime spot, updatecount(), and many more. The smart contract is deployed\
    \ over the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n17 of 26\nRinkeby’s network. On a successful\
    \ compilation and deployment of the smart contract,\nvalidated or authenticated\
    \ data from the smart contract are forwarded to the IPFS-based\npublic blockchain\
    \ for secure storage. Further, the 6G network is simulated on MATLAB\n2022a using\
    \ a 5G toolbox. This is because there is not yet any open-source software available\n\
    that provides 6G properties and can integrate that with real-world applications.\
    \ Due to this\nconstraint, we utilized a 5G-based simulation toolbox, where we\
    \ changed the simulation\nparameters, for example, changing the bandwidth allocation,\
    \ transmit power, sub-carrier\nspacing (240 KHz), and modulation (OFDMA) techniques\
    \ of the 5G network to impersonate\na 6G network.\n5.2. Performance Evaluation\
    \ of the Proposed Architecture\nIn this subsection, we discuss the results of\
    \ the ML classiﬁers, blockchain, and 6G\ncommunication. First, we analyze the\
    \ performance of the different ML classiﬁers, such as\nXGBoost, RF, KNN, LR, and\
    \ SVM, for UAV-based public safety applications such as ﬁre\nincidents, road accidents,\
    \ and criminal activity. Here, ML classiﬁers are used to classify the\ndata into\
    \ attack means class 1 and nonattack means class 0. We considered the criminal\n\
    activity dataset that has the crime type, location, weapon type, and criminal\
    \ behavior\nrecords. These records are useful for classifying the arrest and nonarrest\
    \ categories, which\nidentiﬁes whether the data are vulnerable to attack or not.\
    \ Here, we fed 80% of the data\ninto the ML classiﬁer that provide training to\
    \ the classiﬁer. Then, the 20% testing dataset\nis passed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that validates the training dataset. It also ensures that the\ntrained data\
    \ will behave consistently and produce the expected results.\nHere, Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the performance of the ML classiﬁers in terms of the accuracy,\nlog loss score,\
    \ and validation curve. The accuracy (α) of the ML classiﬁers represents\nthe\
    \ ratio of the correctly predicted values out of a total number of predictions.\
    \ Using an\naccuracy measure, we know how many times the ML classiﬁer correctly\
    \ classiﬁed the\ndataset. We can express accuracy in true positive (Tρ), false\
    \ positive (Fρ), true negative (Tη),\nand false negative (Fη) values that are\
    \ used to represent the number of correct and incorrect\npredictions of the proposed\
    \ ML classiﬁer. During the simulation, we observe that a single\naccuracy parameter\
    \ is insufﬁcient to remark on the best ML classiﬁer. Therefore, we require\nadditional\
    \ measures such as precision (β) and recall (γ). Precision represents the correctness\n\
    of the ML classiﬁer. It determines how good the classiﬁer is at predicting a speciﬁc\
    \ class. It\nshows the ratio between the true positive samples and all the positive\
    \ outcomes Tρ + Fρ.\nThe recall measure represents the count, which shows how\
    \ many times the ML classiﬁer\nwas able to determine a speciﬁc class. It gives\
    \ the ratio between true positive samples out\nof all the cases of true positive\
    \ and false negative samples Tρ + Fη. Furthermore, harmonic\nmean of the precision\
    \ and recall is called F1-score (δ). The mathematical representation of\nthese\
    \ performance measures are represented as follows:\nα =\nTρ + Tη\nTρ + Fρ + Tη\
    \ + Fη\n(13)\nβ =\nTρ\nTρ + Fρ\n(14)\nγ =\nTρ\nTρ + Fη\n(15)\nδ = 2 ∗ β ∗ γ\n\
    β + γ\n(16)\nFigure 3a illustrates the accuracy of the different ML classiﬁers\
    \ such as XGBoost, RF,\nKNN, LR, and SVM. From the graph, we found that XGBoost\
    \ classiﬁer gives better accuracy\n(87.93%) compared to the other classiﬁers because\
    \ it handles sparse data and executes\nparallel computing. On the contrary, SVM\
    \ did not perform well because it required high\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n18 of\
    \ 26\ntraining time for the large dataset. Table 4 shows that the XGBoost classiﬁer\
    \ outperforms\nany other ML classiﬁers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-score.\nTo further measure the ML classiﬁer’s performance, we used a\
    \ log loss score that\nindicates how close the prediction probability is to the\
    \ corresponding actual value in the\nbinary classiﬁcation case. It represents\
    \ the probabilities of the correct class label, which\nmeans that if the predicted\
    \ probability is high, it will obtain a low log loss core and\nvice versa. Figure\
    \ 3b shows the log loss score of the different ML classiﬁers that evaluate\nthe\
    \ performance of the classiﬁers. From the empirical results, we analyzed that\
    \ there is\na higher divergence in the log loss score of the LR and SVM classiﬁers.\
    \ Here, XGBoost’s\nlog loss score is small; therefore, it performed well compared\
    \ to the other ML classiﬁers.\nAdditionally, Figure 3c depicts the validation\
    \ curve of the XGBoost classiﬁer that indicates\nthe sensitivity between changes\
    \ in a classiﬁer’s accuracy and changes in some parameters\nof the classiﬁer.\
    \ Here, if the training score is more than the validation score, the estimator\
    \ is\noverﬁtting, and otherwise performs well.\nXGBoost\nRF\nKNN\nLR\nSVM\nML\

    \ of the literature we observed does not\namalgamate the mentioned key enabler\
    \ technologies, i.e., blockchain, 6G network, AI,\netc. Their approach is based\
    \ on a single technology, but by using that, there must be a\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n19 of 26\nloophole that exists that the attackers can exploit. Therefore,\
    \ an amalgamation of technology\nis needed to offer a secure pipeline for data\
    \ exchange for critical applications, such as\npublic safety applications. The\
    \ work of [63] is similar to our proposed work with better\naccuracies; however,\
    \ their work is based on an image dataset where they used rigorous\ndata augmentation\
    \ techniques and deep learning approaches to acquire better accuracies.\nBecause\
    \ of data augmentation and deep learning approaches, their proposed model is\n\
    highly complex and does not have a commendable system response time. This is because\n\
    deep learning techniques have a higher training time, due to which the response\
    \ becomes\nhigher; hence, one could not send critical data on time to the application\
    \ layer. This can\nalso be seen in Figure 4a, where performance overhead is compared\
    \ between [63] and the\nproposed work. It is clear from the graph that due to\
    \ the high training time, the work of [63]\nhas a high-performance overhead compared\

    \ preprocessing steps are required to train ML classiﬁers. This\ncan be seen in\
    \ Figure 4b, where training time is computed for all ML classiﬁers. XGBoost is\n\
    outperforming other classiﬁers by attaining a training time of 280.97 s. In [63],\
    \ the authors\nused 1400 iterations to obtain a better training accuracy, which\

    \ the blockchain scalability comparison between the proposed\nblockchain with\
    \ IPFS and the traditional blockchain. Generally, an IPFS-based blockchain is\n\
    a decentralized protocol and is open to the public; therefore, anyone who has\
    \ content hash\ncan access the network. Moreover, it offers persistent data storage,\
    \ fault tolerance against a\nsingle point of failure, and a censorship resistance\
    \ mechanism. Due to the aforesaid bene-\nﬁts, the IPFS-based blockchain has a\
    \ better response time than the traditional blockchain\n(i.e., not using IPFS).\
    \ In addition, the immutable nature of the IPFS-based blockchain eases\nnumerous\
    \ cybersecurity threats. It has no overheads of the consensus protocols to add\n\
    the data and only stores the content hash in the network. Thus, the consensus\
    \ and data\naggregation with transformation must be applied before submitting\
    \ a block or ﬁle to IPFS\nstorage. Due to this mechanism, the IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ is faster and more scalable than\nthe conventional blockchain network.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the proposed architecture consists of UAVs for data accumulation and\ndissemination\
    \ between different participants of public safety applications. As public\nsafety\
    \ applications are categorized under the umbrella of mission-critical applications,\n\
    they must ensure reliable and low-latency communication among all the entities\
    \ of the\nproposed architecture. Here, 6G networks fulﬁll the requirements essential\
    \ to the proposed\narchitecture. The 6G network offers high data-transmission\
    \ rates, with ultra-low latency\nthat makes it 1000 times faster than 5G networks.\
    \ Therefore, the network’s transmitter and\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n20 of 26\n\
    receiver have the minimum packet loss ratio. Figure 6 shows the packet drop ratio\

    \ of Adoption of Blockchain in 6G Network\nBlockchain technology entrenches data\
    \ security, user identity, information authenticity,\nand privacy mechanisms into\
    \ the 6G communication system. However, poor efﬁciency of\nconsensus mechanism,\
    \ computation overhead of network systems, storage capacity, limited\nnetwork\
    \ and computing resources, and cross-network sharing imposes a new challenge in\n\
    blockchain-based 6G application. This section provides the possible challenges\
    \ of adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network. Figure 7 displays the research challenges\
    \ when adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n21 of 26\n\

    \ Challenges\nFigure 7. Blockchain adoption challenges in 6G network.\n6.1. Storage\
    \ Capacity\nBlockchain offers decentralized architecture with an immutable ledger\
    \ that securely\nstores the data transaction that cannot be tampered or altered.\
    \ Blockchain permanently\nkeeps data in immutable blocks and is not allowed to\
    \ be altered or deleted by anyone; there-\nfore, it keeps increasing data volume\
    \ and raising data storage capacity issues. During peak\ntime, an increasing number\
    \ of users and data transactions ﬂood the network, leading to\ntransaction delays\
    \ and network overloading issues. Moreover, due to a growing demand\nfor data\
    \ storage capacity and bandwidth, nodes cannot synchronize with each other to\n\
    join the network [64]. Various cloud platforms exist, such as IPFS, Merkle tree-based\
    \ ﬁle\nsystems (MTFS), StorJ, swarm, etc., that resolve the data storage issue\
    \ in the blockchain-\nbased 6G network. The research community has adopted these\
    \ data storage platforms\nwith blockchain and proposed solutions in supply chain\
    \ management, smart agriculture,\nsmart city, etc., to resolve storage issues.\
    \ For example, Pawar et al. [65] proposed an\nIPFS-enabled blockchain repository\
    \ for supply chain management to minimize ﬁle upload\nand download time. Kumar\
    \ et al. [66] introduced a secured privacy-preserving scheme to\nmaintain scalability\
    \ using IPFS-based off-chain storage for smart agricultural UAVs data.\nHowever,\
    \ these solutions face reliability, privacy, and security issues, such as that\
    \ IPFS does\nnot provide private ﬁle storage; it only offers public ﬁle access.\
    \ Likewise, MTFS has access\nspeed and scalability problems with public ﬁle systems.\
    \ From that, it has been noticed that\nthe limited data storage capacity of blockchain\
    \ is a notable challenge in the current and\nfuture networks.\n6.2. Poor Efﬁciency\
    \ of Consensus Mechanism\nThe blockchain network depends on various consensus\
    \ mechanisms such as prac-\ntical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), proof-of-work,\
    \ and proof-of-stake for enterprise\nand permissionless blockchains. However,\
    \ these algorithms are inadequate because they\nconsume more time and energy for\
    \ block production. Researchers have designed various\nconsensus algorithms to\
    \ monitor and verify block production in 6G network. For example,\nWan et al.\
    \ [67] and Zhang et al. [68] proposed a consensus-algorithm-based strategy for\n\
    collision avoidance in UAV swarms and ﬁxed-wing UAVs, respectively. Still, there\
    \ is\nscope for research in this ﬁeld because the algorithms require higher energy\
    \ consumption\nand are vulnerable to malicious attacks such as the 51% attack,\
    \ Sybil attack, race attack,\nand Finney attack.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n22 of\
    \ 26\n6.3. Cross-Network or Cross-Domain Sharing\nBlockchain introduces an interoperability\
    \ feature that offers a cross-chain mechanism\nto transmit asserts, transaction\
    \ values, virtual contracts, and data between two or more\nblockchain networks.\
    \ Unfortunately, the lack of adequate privacy and maintaining the same\nlevel\
    \ of security raise cross-network sharing issues in blockchain-based 6G applications.\n\
    Recently, much work has been carried out for cross-network sharing in blockchain-enabled\n\
    smart applications. For example, in [69], the authors proposed a cross-network\
    \ data-\nsharing mechanism for the smart grid. Likewise, Xue et al. [70] presented\
    \ a cross-domain\nauthentication scheme for medical information sharing. Besides\
    \ these advantages, several\nchallenges remain to be addressed, such as data ownership\
    \ protection with QoS-based\nnetwork heterogeneity.\n6.4. Computation Overhead\n\
    The 6G applications are bandwidth- and resource-hungry; they require real-time\
    \ data\ntransmission. However, the increasing number of network users hinders\
    \ the QoS of the\ndeveloped applications. Therefore, blockchain integrates with\
    \ 6G technologies, reducing\nthe complex computational cost. A lot of research\
    \ has been carried out to overcome the\ncomputation overhead issue in blockchain-based\
    \ 6G applications. For instance, the work of\nChai et al. [71] offered a diffused-PBFT\
    \ approach to reduce computation overhead and con-\nsensus latency. Likewise,\
    \ in [72], the authors proposed an LSTM-based scheme to optimize\nthe computation\
    \ ofﬂoading in a satellite-UAV-based IoT system. Then, Ahmed et al. [73]\nintroduced\
    \ blockchain in VANET for vehicle authentication and emergency message trans-\n\
    mission between the Internet of vehicles (IoVs). They encrypted blockchain servers\
    \ using\nRSA-1024, a digital signature algorithm, to minimize the computation\
    \ overhead. However,\neach participating block of the blockchain and consensus\
    \ algorithms, such as proof-of-work\nand PBFT, require more computational power\
    \ for calculation. On top of that, the continu-\nous growth of IoT devices and\
    \ smart applications leads to high congestion in the network\nand computation\
    \ overhead, where it is infeasible to properly apply a blockchain-based\nconsensus\
    \ approach.\n6.5. Dynamically Changing Environment\nDigital technologies such\
    \ as AI, IoT, and robotics are continuously growing and chang-\ning the future\
    \ perspective, industrial demand, and human behavior. These technologies\nare\
    \ incorporated into various smart applications such as e-healthcare, smart homes,\
    \ smart\nagriculture, holographic communications and many more. According to user\
    \ demand\nfor a high transmission rate with lower latency, these technologies\
    \ should respond in the\nreal-time environment of industries and organizations.\
    \ Moreover, blockchain networks\nare incorporated in dynamic, experimental, and\
    \ sustainable future technologies to intro-\nduce trust, authenticity, security,\
    \ and privacy [74]. The research community has offered\nmany solutions based on\
    \ blockchain for a dynamic changing environment. For example,\nXiao et al. [75]\
    \ proposed temporal pattern attention and enabled the LSTM approach to\nsense\
    \ the change of natural gas deliverability in natural-gas-based IoT systems. They\n\
    utilized a blockchain-based smart contract that dynamically matched the purchase\
    \ and\nsale details of the gas; it also enhanced the buyer’s and the seller’s\
    \ interests. As a result,\nthey could predict the outcome of natural gas in real-time\
    \ according to the dynamic de-\nmand for sales. However, modeling such a real-time\
    \ technique is highly complex and\ntime-consuming in a dynamic changing environment.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nBlockchain is distributed ledger technology that offers reliability,\
    \ security, immutabil-\nity, and privacy in the 6G-based futuristic smart application.\
    \ It proves its effectiveness by\nproviding trust been two parties in the wireless\
    \ communication network. Many research\ncommunities have discussed the adoption\
    \ of blockchain for 6G-based smart applications\nwith new digital technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, AI, and MEC. This technology offers real-time\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n23 of 26\ncommunication with a higher transmission rate; however, it adds\
    \ various challenges, mak-\ning it difﬁcult to adapt to a 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ it is required to propose an exhaustive\nwork highlighting the ﬁndings of multiple\
    \ researchers who worked in the blockchain-\nbased 6G networks. We discussed various\
    \ 6G applications where blockchain is adopted\nfor the security and privacy of\
    \ data. Further, we discussed blockchain-based services in\nthe 6G network. Then,\
    \ we proposed layer-wise architecture by adopting AI, blockchain,\nand a 6G network\
    \ to protect sensitive crime data in public safety applications. An attacker\n\
    tries to manipulate criminal activity information systems to avoid legal action;\
    \ therefore,\nthe proposed architecture offers a secure pipeline to protect public\
    \ safety applications from\nthe nefarious offense. The proposed architecture is\
    \ evaluated on numerous performance\nevaluation metrics such as accuracy, scalability,\
    \ and packet drop rate. Lastly, we identiﬁed\nthe challenge of adopting the blockchain\
    \ in the 6G wireless networks.\nIn the future, based on this work, we will develop\
    \ a novel solution that mitigates the\nidentiﬁed issues and improves the performance\
    \ of the blockchain-based 6G system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

    Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have taken a giant leap in scale, expanding\
    \ their applica-\nbility to a large variety of technological domains and applications,\
    \ ranging from the Internet of things\n(IoT) for smart cities and smart homes\
    \ to wearable technology healthcare applications, underwater,\nagricultural and\
    \ environmental monitoring and many more. This expansion is rapidly growing every\n\
    passing day in terms of the variety, heterogeneity and the number of devices which\
    \ such applications\nsupport. Data collection is commonly the core application\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks, which are\ntypically composed of a large variety of\
    \ devices, some constrained by their resources (e.g., processing,\nstorage, energy)\
    \ and some by highly diverse demands. Many challenges span all the conceptual\n\
    communication layers, from the Physical to the Applicational. Many novel solutions\
    \ devised in the\npast do not scale well with the exponential growth in the population\
    \ of the devices and need to\nbe adapted, revised, or new innovative solutions\
    \ are required to comply with this massive growth.\nFurthermore, recent technological\
    \ advances present new opportunities which can be leveraged in\nthis context.\
    \ This paper provides a cross-layer perspective and review of data gathering in\
    \ WSN and\nIoT networks. We provide some background and essential milestones that\
    \ have laid the foundation\nof many subsequent solutions suggested over the years.\
    \ We mainly concentrate on recent state-of-\nthe-art research, which facilitates\
    \ the scalable, energy-efﬁcient, cost-effective, and human-friendly\nfunctionality\
    \ of WSNs and the novel applications in the years to come.\nKeywords: wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs); Internet of things (IoT); data gathering; wearables;\n\
    compressed sensing; network coding; mobile sink; energy harvesting\n1. Introduction\n\
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are data measurement and gathering networks\nbased\
    \ on small hardware (HW) units capable of sensing, monitoring, or measuring their\n\
    surroundings. The sensed data are transmitted directly or by relay via other sensors\
    \ to\nsome sink or server or a base station. The ultimate objective of such a\
    \ conﬁguration is to\nprovide control or exploration capabilities over an area\
    \ where the network is deployed.\nWSN characteristics can vary substantially:\
    \ they can be composed of a few to hundreds of\nthousands of sensors; the monitored\
    \ terrain can range from a small coverage area (e.g., the\nhuman body) to a vast\
    \ realm (e.g., a forest area for ﬁre detection); the sensed variables of\ninterest\
    \ of the surroundings are diverse (e.g., weather or health parameters, acceleration,\n\
    pollution); and the sensors can have different characteristics (e.g., size, computational\n\
    power, energy source).\nThe Internet of things (IoT) aims to improve day-to-day\
    \ life. The concept includes\nsmart cities, smart homes, pervasive health care,\
    \ assisted living, environmental monitoring,\nsurveillance, and so on. The IoT\
    \ paradigm relies on interconnecting a large number of\ndevices (things) linked\
    \ by the Internet via heterogeneous access networks through which\nthey can exchange\
    \ information with one or more Internet gateways that can process the\ndata, take\
    \ action, and forward them to another destination if needed. Since many IoT\n\
    devices are expected to be wireless, and since sensing is one of the main tasks\
    \ and tools\nutilized by the IoT paradigm, IoT systems will rely extensively on\
    \ WSN technology. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22072650\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n2 of 44\nscale of\
    \ scenarios where WSN are deployed nowadays is vast. Traditionally, WSN were\n\
    classiﬁed based on their placement (e.g., terrestrial, underground, multimedia)\
    \ [1]. Since\nWSNs are closely associated with IoT, contemporary classiﬁcation\
    \ tends to re-attribute the\nnotions of the WSN domain to the IoT domain [2] and\
    \ classify them based on their primary\nobjectives, such as smart cities [3,4],\
    \ healthcare [5], retail and leisure [6], utilities (e.g., smart\nhome energy\
    \ control, water metering and leak detection, and other general infrastructure\n\
    monitoring networks) [7], agriculture and environmental safety (e.g., smart farming\
    \ and\nharvesting, pest control [8–10], seismology monitoring [11,12], oceanology\
    \ [13]), and more.\nAs previously explained, one of the main tasks of both WSN\
    \ and IoT systems is\ndata collection and dissemination. Reports are collected\
    \ from the devices, and updates\nand operational assignments are distributed.\
    \ Maintenance and functional assessments\nare also collected and disseminated.\
    \ Data collection and dissemination in very dense\nnetworks such as WSNs and IoT\
    \ networks which span heterogeneous devices, a signiﬁcant\npercentage of which\
    \ are expected to be small, with very constrained processing, storage,\nand energy\
    \ resources and with minimal network capabilities, is challenging and draws\n\
    signiﬁcant attention both by the industrial and academic communities. Some of\
    \ these\nchallenges include: (i) Information management — the amount of information\
    \ collected or\nneeding to be disseminated to the relevant entities is enormous,\
    \ and some is expected to be\nredundant, both in terms of the information sent\
    \ by each device, which can be compressed,\nand in terms of same information received\
    \ by different entities. Accordingly, innovative\ntechniques are required for\
    \ data compression to reduce transmitted data over wireless\nchannels and aggregation\
    \ techniques that exploit the redundancy between information sent\nby the different\
    \ entities. (ii) Data analysis and reaction — the expected vast data exchange\n\
    and the low latency requirement (at least for some of the information collected)\
    \ require\nprocessing and analysis of data in real-time or near real-time, to\
    \ enable timely decision\nmaking and instantaneous action-taking.\nThe ability\
    \ to successfully transmit and gather vast streams of data incoming from an\n\
    enormous number of devices and sensors and ﬁnally to successfully analyze them,\
    \ in order\nto automatically control a much larger scope of everyday life systems,\
    \ directly couples\nthe process of data gathering with Big Data related challenges\
    \ (e.g., [14–17]). Furthermore,\nleveraging Cloud Computing platforms offers signiﬁcant\
    \ advances in data analytical abil-\nities (e.g., [18–20]). It provides new horizons\
    \ to further develop and increase the size of\nWSN/IoT networks both in the sense\
    \ of the number of sensing units and in the sense of\nthe amount of the acquired\
    \ data (e.g., [21–23]). (iii) Connectivity — collecting and dissem-\ninating data\
    \ from and to many devices, potentially through vast, dense, heterogeneous\nnetworks,\
    \ will be one of the biggest challenges of the future of IoT; accordingly, novel\n\
    MAC protocols and coding schemes should be devised to comply with this challenge.\
    \ With\nthis respect, air time utilization and energy efﬁciency are of primary\
    \ importance for the\nMAC layer protocol design. Any MAC layer protocol should\
    \ ensure that devices utilize the\nwireless channel frugally and with minimum\
    \ energy consumption. (iv) Security and Pri-\nvacy — Connecting enormous numbers\
    \ of devices to the Internet exposes the IoT network\nto serious security vulnerabilities.\
    \ All the more so since the relevant entities are limited.\nAccordingly, issues\
    \ such as authenticity, data encryption, and vulnerability to attacks (e.g.,\n\
    device impersonation) are critical for the IoT paradigm’s continuous growth (e.g.,\
    \ [24]).\nIn addition, since the information transmitted over the WSN and IoT\
    \ networks can be\nhighly conﬁdential (e.g., health reports, device tracking),\
    \ the collection and dissemination\nof this information create signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ related to data protection and privacy.\nThis survey will explore the state-of-the-art\
    \ of data collection and dissemination as-\npects in WSNs and IoT environments\
    \ mentioned above. We will review essential milestones\nyet mainly focus on recent\
    \ publications and present the new trends and research directions.\nOur resources\
    \ included mainly Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and our university’s library\ndatabases,\
    \ utilizing the keywords of this paper. We also used important references from\n\
    the bilbiography of the initial papers and ones that cited them. Data collection\
    \ spans all the\nnetworking layers, from the physical implementation of transmitting\
    \ bits across a commu-\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n3 of 44\nnication medium to the\
    \ application layer. Due to the wide-ranging scope of the topic, we\nwill not\
    \ be able to cover all its aspects (for example, in this paper, we will not discuss\
    \ the\ncritical topic of security and privacy). Some of the issues will be covered\
    \ more thoroughly\nthan others. However, since some of the topics we discussed\
    \ rely on the general wireless\ncommunication technology and on broad setup protocols\
    \ which are not data-gathering ori-\nented per se, on some of the topics, we will\
    \ provide a more comprehensive background and\ndescribe protocols that are aimed\
    \ at a broader domain than data-gathering. For example,\nmany medium access control\
    \ (MAC) and wireless routing protocols are designed for a\nwide range of topologies,\
    \ trafﬁc patterns, quality of service requirements, etc. Even though\nthey can\
    \ be applied, they are not explicitly designed for data gathering. We will include\n\
    some more general yet essential studies in our survey. To grasp the whole picture\
    \ and to\nbetter understand some data-gathering-related issues, in some cases,\
    \ we will delve into the\npertinent background and stray into some peripheral\
    \ topics. We will cover topics related to\nall layers of the protocol stack. Sometimes\
    \ classiﬁcation based on a stack is not clear-cut, as\nsome of the issues involve\
    \ multiple stacks.\nIn particular, the survey comprises the following topics:\n\
    The device’s platform, which accommodates the sensing unit, can highly impact\
    \ the\nperformance of the application utilizing it and speciﬁcally the data-gathering\
    \ application,\nand vice versa, the application (e.g., data gathering) can impact\
    \ the platform architecture\nwhen designed in application-oriented manner or when\
    \ some of the essential features and\nrequirements are taken into account in the\
    \ platform design process. The same mutual\neffect also applies to the WSN infrastructure\
    \ and the network architecture (e.g., topology,\nsystem organization). We start\
    \ with reviewing studies pertaining to the general device’s\nplatform and infrastructure-related\
    \ novelties (Section 2). We cover new domains which\nwere only recently exposed\
    \ to WSN and IoT networks and introduced new opportunities for\nalgorithm design\
    \ in such networks. Some of these novel technologies have revolutionized\nthe\
    \ way applications can utilize each particular device as well as the shared network\
    \ and\nhave enabled new algorithm opportunities and design challenges across the\
    \ entire protocol\nstack which we describe throughout this survey.\nNext follows\
    \ Section 3 which provides a focused summary of recent advances in\ncompressed\
    \ sensing—a signal processing technique that can take advantage of sparsity\n\
    and redundancy of the data. In the context of data gathering procedures, compressed\n\
    sensing is utilized to reduce report payload at several levels, which include\
    \ reduction of\nthe sensed data size and the transmitted report size, by pruning\
    \ the devices that need to\nsend reports and by compressing the combined relayed\
    \ data before forwarding it toward\nits destination (the sink). We provide a basic\
    \ compressed sensing background and review\nthe state-of-the-art in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\nSection 4 considers the medium access control (MAC)\
    \ sublayer. In wireless communi-\ncation, channel utilization is critical and\
    \ broadly inﬂuences several performance aspects\nsuch as throughput, latency,\
    \ power utilization, delivery ratio, and more. Over the years,\nnumerous algorithms\
    \ and protocols have been suggested for wireless channel access in\ngeneral, and\
    \ WSNs with their speciﬁc characterization in particular. In Section 4, we review\n\
    only a small fraction of the countless MAC protocols that have been designed for\
    \ WSNs.\nWe mainly concentrate on protocols that highlight a conceptual approach\
    \ or trend and\nreview some of the more recent MAC protocols in data gathering\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks,\nwhich address new challenges such as highly dense\
    \ networks, congested channels, and\nvery limited resources.\nWe ascend the protocol\
    \ stack and in Section 5 we address routing aspects. As with the\nMAC sublayer,\
    \ routing protocols in multi-hop wireless networks have also been extensively\n\
    studied. We start by providing several milestones in the context of data gathering\
    \ in\nWSNs. We continue with more recent studies which mainly include enhancements\
    \ to the\naforementioned protocol, taking into account new challenges such as\
    \ scalability demands\nand energy-related advances which present new opportunities\
    \ yet impose new constraints.\nWe continue with studies that leverage the multi-hop\
    \ topology to realize a network-coding\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n4 of 44\nmechanism.\
    \ Finally, we discuss a new paradigm that extends the traditional setup in which\n\
    the sensed data need to be routed toward a static central monitoring station (sink),\
    \ and\nutilize a mobile sink (or sinks) that traverse the terrain and can help\
    \ in collecting the devices’\nreports. We review several state-of-the-art schemes\
    \ in this mobile sink paradigm.\nThe ﬁnal section of this survey is dedicated\
    \ to wearable technology in the form of\nsmart devices that are attached to the\
    \ human body to monitor the user and their envi-\nronment. Wearable technology\
    \ involves challenges in all the aspects discussed in the\nprevious sections,\
    \ yet they introduce new opportunities for high-demand applications with\nunique\
    \ performance requirements and constraints. Even though we do not attempt to\n\
    provide a comprehensive review of the numerous applications suggested over the\
    \ years, we\nemphasize this prominent application layer and discuss several applications\
    \ in Section 6.\nAs previously explained, we roughly partitioned the topics covered\
    \ in this survey\nbased on the communication layers and organized the sections\
    \ accordingly. We note\nthat this partition is somehow artiﬁcial, as many innovations\
    \ in data-gathering involve\nmore than one layer. Furthermore, many technological\
    \ advances and research areas affect\nmultiple domains in different layers and\
    \ are visited in more than one section. Figure 1\ndepicts the schematic structure\
    \ of the paper. In the ﬁgure, the ovals represent the main\nresearch domains covered\
    \ in the paper. The hexagons represent the most prominent\nresearch tool innovations\
    \ and techniques utilized by data-gathering, which are covered in\nthe paper.\
    \ The arrows represent the inter-relation between them. For example, technologies\n\
    such as energy harvesting (EH) or Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    (AI) are utilized by innovations in all the layers starting from the platform\
    \ hardware to\nthe application layer. However, network coding is mainly utilized\
    \ by the network layer.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is leveraged by both the\
    \ MAC and the Network layers.\nArchitecture\nSection 2\nMAC\nSection 4\nRouting\n\

    \ Concepts\nOur primary focus in this survey is data gathering in the context\
    \ of wireless commu-\nnication networks. The units that generate the data (typically\
    \ sensors) are application-\ndependent and can serve a large variety of realms,\
    \ e.g., health, environmental, activity\nmonitoring, etc. Even though the sensing\
    \ unit is the essence, we will not cover it thor-\noughly, and we will only skim\
    \ through it sporadically when discussing applications and\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n5 of 44\ntheir speciﬁc requirements. Nonetheless, the term “sensor” typically\
    \ refers to the whole\nplatform or device in which the sensing unit is only one\
    \ component out of many, such as\nprocessing unit, transceiver unit, power unit,\
    \ antenna, and more, several of which can be\nintegrated into the device according\
    \ to the particular application needs. The sensing unit\nitself has its own requirements\
    \ and constraints, and in many situations cannot be altered.\nIn addition, the\
    \ integrated unit architecture and the platform design can be subject to\nvarious\
    \ stringent constraints. For example, size requirements can impose a strict constraint\n\
    on the device design; low power consumption, low production cost, and self-operation\
    \ can\nrepresent additional constraints. Accordingly, the device architecture\
    \ is fundamental and\naffects many other factors in the system. For example, power\
    \ supply affects the life span\n(or the time needed to replace the batteries);\
    \ it also affects transmission range, memory,\nand processing unit, which in turn\
    \ can affect the algorithms that can be executed on the\ndevice, etc.\nExtensive\
    \ research has been conducted on the design and architecture of the end\ndevice\
    \ and the infrastructure. We leave a detailed description of the basic components\
    \ such\nas the sensing unit, transceiver, antenna, processing unit, etc., as well\
    \ as the underlying\nhardware beyond the scope of this survey. To this end, the\
    \ objective of the rest of this section\nrefers to how data-gathering objectives\
    \ may impact both the design of speciﬁc sensors\nand the WSN infrastructure. By\
    \ the latter, we mean topology, system organization used to\ngather the data,\
    \ and algorithms to implement the data gathering. It is noteworthy that the\n\
    sensors’ characteristics also dictate the topology and, consequently, the data\
    \ aggregation\nalgorithms. In the sequel, we mention several platform architecture\
    \ designs as well as\nseveral network-wide architectures, mostly from recent years.\
    \ Additional similar studies\nappear throughout the survey, yet they are organized\
    \ in chapters according to the area in\nwhich they propose the most signiﬁcant\
    \ novelty. Figure 2 presents a schematic description\nof the section. Since several\
    \ papers presented in this section cover more than one topic, and\nsince, as previously\
    \ mentioned, this section is not presumed to provide an exhaustive list\nof all\
    \ papers or topics covered by the scope of WSN architecture, and some of the topics\
    \ are\nnot covered at all or covered by only a few representative papers, the\
    \ description is broad\nand only highlights the main topics covered in the section.\n\

    \ topics covered in the section.\n2.1. Application-Oriented\nMany sensor platforms\
    \ are application-oriented. Occasionally, their suggested ar-\nchitecture can\
    \ be applied to other applications; however, their design and evaluation are\n\
    typically aimed at a speciﬁc one. Hence, in many cases, both hardware and software\n\
    technological developments are introduced for effective functioning. One of the\
    \ most\ncommon tasks of WSN is the obvious one of monitoring a terrain. There\
    \ are many variants\nof WSN monitoring. For example, the requirement can be to\
    \ monitor every point in the\nField of Interest (FoI) vs. monitoring a limited\
    \ number of speciﬁc locations or targets (aka\ntarget coverage) vs. just monitoring\
    \ a border of a region to detect intruders (aka barrier\ncoverage). The coverage\
    \ problem typically involves selecting a subset of sensors that fulﬁll\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n6 of 44\nthe monitoring objective while maintaining network\
    \ connectivity. The sensors’ capabilities\nand the monitoring objective determine\
    \ the network topology.\nWe present several recent examples that mainly concentrate\
    \ on connectivity and data\ngathering under the constraints of the monitoring\
    \ objective. Biswas et al. [25] focus on\nenergy-efﬁcient data gathering in target\
    \ coverage problem, in which an n sensor WSN\nneeds to monitor T speciﬁc targets,\
    \ and there exists a route (multi-hop) from each source to\nthe sink. The paper\
    \ assumes that the source nodes that sense the targets and initiate data\npackets\
    \ into the network are known, and deals with the forwarding of these packets to\n\
    the sink. The paper proposes a distributed data gathering algorithm in which after\
    \ each\nnode discovers its neighbors and their hop-count to the sink, it will\
    \ forward data packets\n(when required) to its neighbor with maximum remaining\
    \ energy and a lower hop count\nto the sink (the remaining energy is assumed to\
    \ be known). Ammari [26] focuses on the\nk-coverage problem in which each point\
    \ in the FoI is required to be covered by at least k\nsensors at any time, and\
    \ each active sensor participating in the monitoring task is required\nto be connected\
    \ to the sink (possibly via a multi-hop route). The paper assumes that the\nsensors\
    \ are heterogeneous (they do not have the same characteristics) and mobile, hence\n\
    the sensors can move toward any region of interest in the deployment ﬁeld to participate\
    \ in\nany deﬁcient k-coverage area and can also act as mobile proxy sinks that\
    \ collect sensed data\nfrom the sensors and deliver them to the sink. Ammari [26]\
    \ partitions the problem into\ntwo problems which are solved sequentially. Namely,\
    \ the mobile k-coverage problem, which\nselects a minimum subset of active sensors\
    \ that solve the k-coverage problem and the data\ngathering problem, and devise\
    \ a forwarding scheme from the active sensors to the sink such\nthat the energy\
    \ consumption due to sensor mobility and communication is minimized.\nMdemaya\
    \ and Bomgni [27] utilize mobile sensors to achieve area coverage. These\nmobile\
    \ sensors can be moved and relocated to cover holes after the random deployment.\n\
    The authors suggest a two-phase approach. According to the ﬁrst one, the monitoring\n\
    area after the initial random deployment is identiﬁed (by the BS), and mobile\
    \ nodes are\nrelocated to cover the monitoring holes detected after the initial\
    \ deployment, trying to\nensure full coverage of the AoI by the static and relocated\
    \ sensors. At the second stage, the\nproposed algorithm schedules the sensors’\
    \ activity (awakening and transmission times)\nthat minimizes the energy consumption\
    \ of the nodes while collecting and sending data\nto the base station. To this\
    \ end, the paper distinguishes between “normal” nodes and\ncluster heads. A survey\
    \ that reviews algorithms and techniques related to the connectivity-\ncoverage\
    \ issues in WSN can be found in Boukerche and Sun [28].\nOccasionally, WSN architectures\
    \ and designs are more application-oriented. For\nexample, Cerchecci et al. [29]\
    \ propose a sensor node topology that uses low-cost and low-\npower components\
    \ for energy-efﬁcient waste management in the context of smart cities.\nThe architecture\
    \ described in [29] suggests a node architecture for measuring the ﬁlling\nlevel\
    \ of trash bins and utilizes LoRa LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) technology\n\
    for real-time data transmission to collect the measured data in a remote data\
    \ collection\ncenter. The design of a sensor node that can detect the presence\
    \ of water on home ﬂoors and\nprovide early warning of water leaks is suggested\
    \ by Teixidó et al. [30]. The paper presents\nand deploys both hardware and software\
    \ of the network components (ﬂood sensing nodes,\nactuator nodes, and a control\
    \ central); communication within the sensor network relies\non the IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard. Borrero and Zabalo [31] present a low-cost agriculture-\noriented\
    \ system. The suggested system is based on LoRa technology and can collect various\n\
    measurements, such as humidity, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and temperature,\n\
    and enables a farmer to access all of the information necessary to achieve efﬁcient\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement of crops in real time. The developed wireless sensor\
    \ node has been optimized\nboth in hardware and software and exhibits very low\
    \ power consumption.\n2.2. Energy-Harvesting (EH)\nOne of the main concerns of\
    \ the sensor platform’s design is the source of energy.\nTypically, the energy\
    \ source is a battery attached to the sensor platform. It is utilized to\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n7 of 44\nprovide power to all the required operations, e.g.,\
    \ wireless transmission, computation,\nmemory, etc. The battery properties (e.g.,\
    \ technology used and size) can determine its\nlifespan as well as several other\
    \ properties, e.g., transmission range. In many systems,\nthe battery is a burden,\
    \ as it increases the cost of the system, constrains the platform size,\nand most\
    \ importantly, requires to be replaced occasionally. The challenge of saving power\n\
    spans all the protocol stack; energy considerations show up in each part of this\
    \ survey. As\nwith the other layers, PHY layer innovations have also been suggested\
    \ as to how to utilize\nbattery power efﬁciently.\nAn alternative approach to\
    \ overcome the battery hurdle is to embed a mechanism\nthat harvests energy. Such\
    \ a mechanism can be embedded alongside the battery to ex-\ntend its lifespan,\
    \ or more commonly, it can completely replace the battery so that all the\nfunctions\
    \ rely on it. Batteryless WSNs that rely solely on energy-harvesting (EH)-WSN\n\
    can compromise performance; for example, their transmission range can be shorter,\
    \ the\navailable energy can constrain their awake time, and so on. One of the\
    \ main challenges is to\nlocate the ambient resource from which the energy can\
    \ be harvested. Many studies have ex-\nplored different energy sources that can\
    \ supplement energy, such as solar, vibration, wind,\nmotion, electromagnetic,\
    \ and more. Numerous comprehensive technological overviews\nwith their advantages\
    \ and limitations, energy harvesting modeling, challenge expectations,\nand prospects\
    \ can be found in, for example, Refs. [32–37]. A more recent system design\nreview\
    \ on battery-free and energy-aware WSNs, which utilize ambient energy or wireless\n\
    energy transmission, is given in [38]. It addresses energy supply strategies and\
    \ provides\ninsight into energy management methods and possibilities for energy\
    \ saving at the node\nand network levels.\nKhalid et al. [39] suggest a zero-power\
    \ wireless sensor architecture that consists of\na capacitive sensor (a sensor\
    \ that associates the parameter of interest with the change in\nthe capacitance),\
    \ an RFID chip, a circulator (allows power ﬂow between three deﬁned\nports), and\
    \ an antenna (batteryless). The conceptual idea is that the sensor reﬂects the\n\
    signal received from the RFID, with a change in phase, which is relative to the\
    \ sensed value.\nDesign and implementation of an energetically autonomous WSN\
    \ platform for ambient\nmonitoring in indoor environments are suggested by Abella\
    \ et al. [40]. The proposed self-\npowered autonomous sensor node platform relies\
    \ on embedded photo-voltaic (PV) panels\nto harvest the energy, a microcontroller\
    \ and an RF transceiver with an attached antenna.\nThe suggested architecture\
    \ was prototyped and validated experimentally. Lee et al. [41]\npropose a ﬂoating\
    \ wireless device with energy harvesting capability. The ﬂoating device is\nenergetically\
    \ self-sustaining for extended operational hours. It supports long-range com-\n\
    munication between wireless sensor nodes and a gateway relying on the LoRa technology\n\
    while deployed over a water surface. The ﬂoating device can be used as an environmental\n\
    monitoring station to remotely collect weather and water quality information.\
    \ Ref. [42]\npresent the design of a wireless sensor node, powered by solar energy,\
    \ that collects en-\nvironmental data and can transmit it across vast distances\
    \ (directly to the cloud). The\narchitecture presented therein relies on low-power\
    \ wide-area network (LPWAN) protocols\nthat provide a long-range communication\
    \ system with limited data to transmit and high\nenergy efﬁciency. The authors\
    \ utilize Sigfox technology in their proof-of-concept design.\nAs previously mentioned\
    \ in numerous papers, surveys and tutorials exploring dif-\nferent aspects of\
    \ energy harvesting in WSN exist (a sliver of which we present herein).\nWe will\
    \ revisit EH when we discuss various aspects of data aggregation, such as routing\n\
    enhancement for EH-WSN (under EH constraints), on which we elaborate in Section\
    \ 5.2 or\nwhen discussing wearables in Section 6.\n2.3. Topology\nThroughout the\
    \ survey, the interaction of WSN and IoT will arise in multiple contexts.\nWhile\
    \ this survey mainly deals with data gathering by means of wireless units, an\
    \ IoT unit\npresumes a more high-level entity for localized data gathering. To\
    \ assess the connection\nbetween these two concepts, the reader is advised to\
    \ refer to the most recent work by\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n8 of 44\nDevadas et\
    \ al. [43], for example, where the authors enumerate the IoT data management\n\
    frameworks, challenges and issues. The chapter focuses on three layers of data\
    \ management\nin IoT networks, communication, storage and processing. In addition,\
    \ deployment of IoT\nData management for smart home and smart city is described.\n\
    It is essential to distinguish between a one-directional WSN platform, where sensors\n\
    merely gather the data and activate a speciﬁc infrastructure and set of technologies\
    \ to further\nsend it to a sink, and a bi-directional WSN platform, where the\
    \ sensors are expected to be\nable to act according to control messages received\
    \ from a sink. In the latter case, the sink\nmight be a higher-level entity (e.g.,\
    \ a cloud-based server). While the general data-gathering\ntechniques are usually\
    \ agnostic of the control direction, additional constraints might be\nimposed.\
    \ Delay of the responses, latency, BW usage efﬁciency, security, and privacy are\n\
    some of the demands to consider. Another example of a bi-directional platform\
    \ can be\nseen in social sensor clouds (SSC), which connect a social network with\
    \ a sensor network\nvia a cloud infrastructure. See, for example, Zhu et al. [44],\
    \ which presents a scenario of a\nsmart village and provides discussion on various\
    \ aspects including green planning, energy\nconcerns, and speed of data gathering\
    \ and sharing. In Dinh and Kim [45], an on-demand\nWSN platform is designed. The\
    \ authors suggest a data-gathering protocol that addresses\nbandwidth consumption\
    \ and delivery latency and minimizes the number of requests\nto save resources.\
    \ An infrastructure where sensors form groups belonging to private\nowners constitutes\
    \ a special case. This may be the case in a smart city environment; this\nmeans\
    \ that privacy and/or security considerations should be prioritized. This is the\
    \ topic\naddressed by Zhu et al. [46]. The authors provide a trust-assisted cloud\
    \ for WSN but have\nthroughput issues in mind. Kuo et al. [47] suggest a WSN-based\
    \ IoT platform that provides\na reliable connection between sensors in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the database on the Internet. The\nproposed platform is based on the IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4e time-slotted channel-hopping protocol\nwith resource-constrained devices\
    \ supporting heterogeneous applications. The paper\nsuggests a scheme that compensates\
    \ the clock drift for every timeslot to maintain the clock\nsynchronization required\
    \ for the time-slotted channel-hopping protocol.\nEdge computing, as discussed\
    \ by Satyanarayanan [48], allows distributing the data\ngathering burden across\
    \ multiple cloudlets, which might be highly beneﬁcial for large\nWSN. This platform\
    \ paradigm aims to improve many important aspects: reduced latency\nof data delivery,\
    \ increased bandwidth, scalability, resilience to possible cloud outages,\nand\
    \ privacy control. However, the platform presumes an initial capital investment\
    \ and\nlater maintenance.\nA virtual sensor network was proposed by Abdelwahab\
    \ et al. [49]. Once a user-\ninitiated sensing request is dispatched to a cloud,\
    \ a suitable set of sensors is found for\nthe task. The decision is made according\
    \ to the cost function, which depends on the\nspeciﬁc (e.g., monetary) cost of\
    \ using sensors from the designated set, the beneﬁt that\ncan be received from\
    \ using these sensors, and their effectiveness in distances and delays\n(calculated,\
    \ e.g., in number of hops from sensor to a sink/gateway), also expressed as\n\
    virtual links. The cost might be customized, while a general virtualization problem\
    \ is\nformulated and the algorithm is provided.\nIntegration of unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) and WSN for crop monitoring in\nprecision agriculture is described\
    \ by Popescu et al. [50]. The authors suggest a down-up\nscheme, where the collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level to the\ncluster head\
    \ (CH) level, then collected by the UAV level and ﬁnally delivered to the cloud\n\
    for analysis and possible feedback. Particular emphasis is put on outlying measurements\n\
    from speciﬁc sensors, as they can indicate either a possible sensor failure or\
    \ an upcoming\nunusual event inside the agricultural ﬁeld. The measured data were\
    \ processed through a\nconsensus algorithm. Concurrently, it suppressed outlier\
    \ values left for further examination\nfor the cloud-based analysis. In addition,\
    \ this study focused on the UAV trajectory planning\nto collect the data observed\
    \ by the WSN. Actual deployment with several tens of sensors\nand several CHs\
    \ is provided and analyzed. Note that we dedicate Section 5.4 to data\ngathering\
    \ assisted by a mobile unit.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n9 of 44\nAn implementation\
    \ of a ubiquitous consumer data service for transmitting short mes-\nsages to\
    \ any computing platform is provided by Datta et al. [51]. The authors demonstrate\n\
    a data cycle model that allows any device with sensor(s) to report data encoded\
    \ in short\nmessages. The raw data reaches a central or distributed computing\
    \ platform, where it\nundergoes transformation and evolves into rich and structured\
    \ valuable information for\nhigher-layer applications. The proposed data cycle\
    \ model and DataTweet architecture are\naimed at smart city and large-scale crowd-sensing-based\
    \ IoT scenarios.\n2.4. Application-Oriented Network Architecture\nWe continue\
    \ by covering special types of WSN platforms for data gathering and\nspecialized\
    \ application-driven architecture types. Ayele et al. [52] suggest an IoT network\n\
    architecture for wildlife monitoring systems (WMS) for scenarios in which animals\
    \ exhibit\nsparse mobility, which results in sporadic wireless links. In addition,\
    \ they suggest a\ndata forwarding enhancement that adopts the ﬂood-store-carry-and-forward\
    \ paradigm\nsuggested in the seminal ZebraNet study by Juang et al. [53], in which\
    \ in order to send data\nto the sink, the nodes disseminate it among themselves\
    \ until it reaches the sink. Speciﬁcally,\neach node stores the data needing to\
    \ be conveyed, waits for connectivity with other nodes,\nand distributes the data\
    \ to them, and they repeat the same process. Accordingly, the data is\nspread\
    \ throughout the entire network (i.e., ﬂooding) and will eventually be received\
    \ by the\nsink. The authors in [52] suggest leveraging locally available routing\
    \ parameters to improve\nopportunistic data forwarding algorithms by managing\
    \ the data replication decision.\nSaleh et al. [54] suggest extending the lifetime\
    \ of a wireless sensor network used in\nmobile healthcare applications by increasing\
    \ the number of bits transmitted per symbol, and\nspeciﬁcally to rely on a quaternary\
    \ interconnect scheme in which each transmitted symbol\nmodulates two bits. A\
    \ complementary neural network, static RAM-based architecture is\nsuggested to\
    \ reduce energy consumption in storage and transmissions during the data\ndissemination\
    \ process. A WSN dedicated to home deployment for elderly healthcare and\nearly\
    \ health emergency alarm is discussed by Alsina-Pagès et al. [55]. The authors\
    \ ﬁrst raise\nprivacy concerns related to the monitoring, and accordingly, advocate\
    \ that only sound-\nbased surveillance aimed to merely indicate alarming situations\
    \ is appropriate. In order\nto further conform to the privacy demands, they focus\
    \ on distributed architecture (rather\nthan on a centralized one), where each\
    \ of the WSN sensors sends encrypted identiﬁers of\ntheir measurement. The identiﬁcation\
    \ of events is built on feature extraction. This is done\non the frequency domain\
    \ by ﬁrst dividing the incoming signal into blocks with Hamming\nsliding window,\
    \ then transforming into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier\nTransform\
    \ (DFT) to evaluate the contribution of every band of the spectrum. The ﬁnal\n\
    coefﬁcients are obtained after Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The conclusive\
    \ parts of the\nproposed algorithm classify the coefﬁcients, feeding them into\
    \ Support Vector Machines\nwhich classiﬁes the estimated audio event. The authors\
    \ assert that the classiﬁcation results\ncould be further improved by incorporating\
    \ a deep artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) into\ntheir system.\nIn AbeBer et al.\
    \ [56], a similar method was implemented for urban noise monitoring.\nNamely,\
    \ while STFT was utilized for the noise preprocessing, the classiﬁcation of noise\n\
    levels and events was performed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors\n\
    used several previously published networks; see references therein. Similar methods\
    \ for\nnoise monitoring WSN were introduced by Siamwala et al. [57]. The frequency-domain\n\
    analysis was performed. Then, classiﬁcation by statistical methods was accomplished\n\
    (Gaussian mixture model was used). In addition, the authors in [57] provide an\
    \ elaborate\nWSN architecture, where energy-harvesting solar panels augment the\
    \ sensors’ lifetime and\nthe sensors’ state-of-charge is transmitted and tracked\
    \ by central, more powerful nodes.\n3. Compressed Sensing\nMany data-gathering\
    \ applications rely on numerous self-powered smart devices to\ncollect real-time\
    \ data and convey it via a wireless medium to a central entity or entities\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n10 of 44\n(e.g., the cloud) to further process it and act upon\
    \ it. Such devices are expected to perform\ntwo basic operations—sensing and wireless\
    \ connectivity. Two important hindering aspects\nthat derive from these operations\
    \ inﬂuence the performance and need to be considered\nare: (i) energy consumption\
    \ associated with these two operations, especially when many of\nthese devices\
    \ are typically simple with limited computation abilities and battery lifetime\n\
    (ii) airtime utilization, which can also degrade the performance causing high\
    \ delays, jitter,\nbattery consumption, etc. Accordingly, one of the main challenges\
    \ in combating these\nlimitations is reducing the report payload, which affects\
    \ each report’s transmission time\nand channel utilization. Reducing the payload\
    \ of the sensed data can be accomplished at\ndifferent levels; it can be done\
    \ in the sensing stage by reducing the size of the sensed data, as\nwell as in\
    \ the report preparing stage by compressing the report size, and in the transmission\n\
    stage, by selecting which devices need to send reports, thus limiting redundant\
    \ information.\nWhen the reports need to travel multiple hops before reaching\
    \ their destination, this can\nbe done at the relay stage by pruning, unifying,\
    \ and compressing reports. In the sequel,\nwe discuss Compressed Sensing (CS).\
    \ This novel paradigm can reduce report payload at\nseveral levels mentioned above,\
    \ hence lowering the sensing operation’s transmission time\nand energy consumption.\n\
    Compressed sensing is a signal-processing technique that is most advantageous\
    \ when\nthe subject signal is sparse in some domain, such that a minimal non-zero\
    \ vector of coefﬁ-\ncients can represent it. The signal sparsity enables a high-quality\
    \ reconstruction, which is\nattained by ﬁnding the solution to an under-determined\
    \ linear system of equations with\nthe smallest possible number of non-zero values.\
    \ Thus, a convex minimization problem\nneeds to be solved to perform the recovery.\
    \ Note that the CS technique performs non-\nuniform sampling of the data signal\
    \ with an average sample rate usually smaller than\nthe minimal rate mandated\
    \ by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. A detailed view\nof the technique can\
    \ be found in Balouchestani et al. [58] and Donoho [59]. Various net-\nworking\
    \ domains can utilize compressed sensing, for example, Feizi et al. [60] depict\
    \ some\napplications of CS over networks and elucidate the connection between\
    \ CS and traditional\ninformation-theoretic techniques in source coding and channel\
    \ coding. Particularly, CS is\nhighly suitable for sensed data gathering in wireless\
    \ sensor networks (e.g., physical phe-\nnomena or a scenery), as it can leverage\
    \ the expected high spatial and temporal correlation\nbetween sensing reports\
    \ sent by neighboring sensors at different times in order to acquire\nthe CS paradigm’s\
    \ desired sparsity. In the following, we review several such data-gathering\n\
    schemes that utilize CS.\nLuo et al. [61,62] consider a densely deployed monitoring\
    \ sensor network in which\nreports traverse multiple hops before reaching their\
    \ destination, a sink. These studies\nrely on the concept that sensors’ readings\
    \ are spatially correlated; hence, there exists a\ntransform domain in which the\
    \ sensed signals can be sparsely represented. Both propose\na compressive data-gathering\
    \ (CDG) procedure in which sensors distributively encode\ntheir reports by projecting\
    \ them on a random space basis using random coefﬁcients. These\nencoded reports\
    \ can be decoded at the sink using compressive sensing techniques. Specif-\nically,\
    \ CDG is designed for multi-hop networks where messages need to travel multiple\n\
    hops before reaching their destination. The sampling process that characterizes\
    \ the CS\ncompression process is performed individually at each sensor by simple\
    \ multiplications\nand additions. Particularly, CDG suggests that rather than\
    \ forwarding individual sensor\nreadings, each sensor uses each of its reports\
    \ (measurements) to construct and send M\ndifferent messages, each comprising\
    \ a weighted sum of the sensor’s own report with other\nsensors’ reports traversing\
    \ it (relaying). Formally, denote by vector d = [d1, d2, . . . , dN]T\nthe measurements\
    \ (readings) obtained by all the sensors, where N is the number of nodes in\n\
    the WSN and di denotes the measurement (reading) obtained by sensor si. The sink\
    \ obtains\nM messages (weighted sums) represented by the vector y = Φd = φ1d1,\
    \ φ2d2, . . . , φNdN,\nwhere Φ is an M × N (M << N) matrix comprising the series\
    \ of coefﬁcients generated\nby the sensors, and in particular, φi is the i-th\
    \ column vector of Φ, which denotes the\nrandom coefﬁcients selected by sensor\
    \ i. Luo et al. [61] suggest that the measurement\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n11\
    \ of 44\nmatrix (coefﬁcients matrix) Φ should be a full random matrix with its\
    \ entries being i.i.d.\nGaussian random numbers drawn according to N (0, 1\nM).\
    \ The paper suggests that each\nweighted sum coefﬁcient be chosen pseudo-randomly\
    \ based on each sensor’s ID in order\nto avoid the burden and high overhead required\
    \ to collect these coefﬁcients by the sink\nif they are chosen randomly. Ref.\
    \ [62] extends the random coefﬁcient selection suggested\nin [61] to an only partly\
    \ random matrix in which the entries of a sub-matrix are still drawn\naccording\
    \ to N (0, 1\nM). Yet, for the rest of the matrix, two options are suggested,\
    \ either an\nupper triangular matrix with non-zero entries drawn according to\
    \ N (0, 1\nM), or the identity\nmatrix. CDG exploits the compressive sampling\
    \ theory and shows that when the sensor\nreadings are compressible, the sink will\
    \ be able to accurately recover the reports even when\nthe number of weighted\
    \ sums (messages) each sensor generates for each report (M) is\nmuch lower than\
    \ the number of reporting sensors (N). For example, on a route comprising\nN sensors,\
    \ the sink needs to collect only M << N messages to encode the information sent\n\
    by all the N sensors.\nSeveral studies further explore the sparsity of the sensed\
    \ signal and its projection\nmatrix, as well as the number of messages (M) that\
    \ should be delivered to the sink. For\nexample, Wang et al. [63] argue that most\
    \ natural signals are nonstationary and ordinarily\nvariable in the temporal and\
    \ spatial domains. In CS, these directly inﬂuence the recon-\nstruction process\
    \ and the number of required measurements; consequently, setting a ﬁxed\nnumber\
    \ of measurements with a ﬁxed transform basis (coefﬁcient matrix Φ) can result\n\
    in poor performance (inaccurate measurement reconstruction). Accordingly, Ref.\
    \ [63]\nsuggests an adaptive data-gathering scheme based on CS, which utilizes\
    \ an autoregressive\n(AR) model to exploit the local spatial correlation between\
    \ sensed data of neighboring\nsensor nodes. The suggested reconstruction scheme\
    \ adapts to the variation of sensed data\nby adjusting the AR parameters. The\
    \ number of measurements is adjusted adaptively\nwith the sensed data by evaluating\
    \ the recovery result and approximating the number of\nmeasurements required to\
    \ satisfy the accuracy demand.\nTo reduce the transmission overhead, Xu et al.\
    \ [64] propose the compressed sparse\nfunction (CSF) scheme. The basic concept\
    \ of CSF is, rather than encode the sensed data\nby projecting it on a basis on\
    \ which it can be represented sparsely, as in typical CS-based\nschemes, to compress\
    \ the sensed data in the form of sparse functions, which are sent to the\nsource.\
    \ The source can recover the function using techniques from polynomial approxi-\n\
    mation/interpolation theory and use them to compute data values that were not\
    \ reported.\nSpeciﬁcally, CSF ﬁnds a function that maps the sensors’ identiﬁers\
    \ and their readings, which\ncan be expressed in a very sparse way, and only communicates\
    \ this function to the sink.\nAfter the sink recovers the function, it can recover\
    \ all the N sensor readings. Xu et al. [64]\nshow that the CSF approach can provide\
    \ good recovery accuracy (better than the CDG\nscheme suggested by [61]) while\
    \ substantially reducing the message overhead (mainly in\ntree-structured networks).\
    \ Li et al. [65] present a general CS framework for WSNs and IoT\nand show how\
    \ the proposed framework can be utilized to reconstruct the compressible\ninformation.\
    \ The suggested framework comprises three phases: (i) information sensing\nto\
    \ detect and compressively sample event signals; (ii) compressed sampling, in\
    \ which the\nsystem samples information traversing the networks; and (iii) reconstruction\
    \ algorithms, in\nwhich the system accurately reconstructs the original signal\
    \ from the compressed samples.\nDifferent studies tackle the sampling issue and\
    \ suggest different approaches to reduce\nthe number of reports sent such that\
    \ only a subset of the sensors sense the object or\nphenomenon at a time. Several\
    \ studies explore how sensed data is conveyed to the sink\nwith the insight that\
    \ the compression is at least attained along the path to the sink, and is\ntherefore\
    \ affected by it. For example, Dhanapala et al. [66] show that a random-walk-based\n\
    sampling, rather than the conventional uniform-sampling-based CS for function\
    \ recovery,\ncan be used for phenomena awareness either at a sink or at other\
    \ sensors without a sink,\nwith minimal additional sampling. As the distribution\
    \ of the samples has a signiﬁcant effect\non the recovery, Ref. [66] suggests\
    \ an upper bound for the probability of successful recovery\nwith a given error\
    \ percentage. The derived bound provides an approximate number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n12 of 44\nsamples required to recover a function under a selected\
    \ basis and a sampling scheme.\nZheng et al. [67] further argue that random walk\
    \ provides a more practical approach for\nthe data-gathering application in WSNs\
    \ and explores the sparsity of collecting non-uniform\nmeasurements while sampling\
    \ along multiple random paths. The paper suggests that\nthe M × N measurement\
    \ matrix will be characterized by M independent random walks.\nSpeciﬁcally, each\
    \ of the M matrix rows corresponds to the set of vertices visited by the\nrespective\
    \ random walk. The paper analyzes the required number of random walks (M)\nand\
    \ their corresponding lengths (how many entries on each row are non-zero) under\
    \ the\nproposed random walk algorithm.\nZheng et al. [68] suggest a cluster-based\
    \ data-gathering mechanism, in which the\nterrain is divided into cells; in each\
    \ cell, a node is randomly selected as the cell head,\nwhich collects the data\
    \ from the cell members and forwards it to the sink. Zheng et al. [68]\nsuggest\
    \ two forwarding mechanisms, one relying on centrally deﬁned tree-based for-\n\
    warding, and another that is a gossip-based approach. The projection process is\
    \ similar\nto Luo et al. [61,62], being based on random coefﬁcients. Another clustering-based\
    \ hi-\nerarchical data aggregation protocol that relies on CS, termed HDACS, is\
    \ suggested by\nXu et al. [69]. Speciﬁcally, HDACS constructs a multilevel hierarchical\
    \ structure and adap-\ntively sets multiple compression thresholds based on cluster\
    \ sizes at different levels of the\ndata aggregation tree to optimize the amount\
    \ of transmitted data. The encoding procedure\nis adapted from [62], where each\
    \ cluster-head recovers (decodes) all received messages\nfrom its descendants\
    \ (retrieves the original data) before compressing and sending it to its\nparent\
    \ cluster-head.\nMotivated by reducing power consumption, Lan and Wei [70] also\
    \ suggest a\ncompressibility-based clustering algorithm for hierarchical compressive\
    \ data gathering. In\nthis study, the network is decomposed into a logical chain,\
    \ and sensor nodes are grouped\nbased on the compressibility of their readings\
    \ instead of by a random clustering approach.\nThis clustering approach strives\
    \ to minimize the average compression ratio of all clusters by\ngreedily selecting\
    \ the set of nodes based on the compression ratio. It then tries to maximize\n\
    the number of compressible clusters so as to determine the suitable transmission\
    \ mode\nfor each cluster using a mode threshold that is a function of the number\
    \ of nodes and the\nnumber of hops from a cluster-head to a sink.\nTo reduce the\
    \ number of sensors involved in each CS measurement, Wu et al. [71]\npropose a\
    \ sparsest random scheduling scheme for compressive data gathering in large-\n\
    scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), leveraging the spatial-temporal properties\
    \ in the\nsensory data. The central theme of this study is that the measurement\
    \ matrix is designed\nbased on the representation basis and sensory data and according\
    \ to the sensor network\nrequirements rather than the network environment. By\
    \ combining compressed sensing\nand network coding in the data-gathering scheme,\
    \ Yin et al. [72] introduce a multi-hop\ntopology in which the sink node adaptively\
    \ adjusts the measurement formation according\nto the reconstruction of received\
    \ measurements at each data-gathering epoch. The sink\nnode dictates the data\
    \ aggregation performed to balance the energy consumption among\nsensor nodes.\n\
    Xu et al. [73] exploit the CS paradigm for network tomography. Speciﬁcally, Ref.\
    \ [73]\nleverages the fact that, typically, only a small fraction of network entities\
    \ such as links or\nnodes are responsible for anomalies or degradation in network\
    \ performance, as a limited\nnumber of congested links can be responsible for\
    \ signiﬁcant delays or high packet drop\nrates, and suggests utilizing CS theory\
    \ in order to identify these few entities based on end-\nto-end measurements.\
    \ Zheng et al. [74] provide an analysis of the capacity and delay of\ndata gathering\
    \ with compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks. The paper considers\n\
    a random topology where sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a region, for both\n\
    single-sink and multi-sink scenarios, and characterizes the capacity and delay\
    \ performance\nimprovement that the CS paradigm can achieve for data gathering.\
    \ In particular, for\nthe single sink, a simple routing scheme for data gathering\
    \ with CS is suggested, and\na tight capacity in the order sense is presented.\
    \ In particular, the suggested routing\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n13 of 44\nscheme\
    \ with pipelining scheduling algorithm for data gathering shows that the proposed\n\
    single-sink scheme can achieve a capacity gain of Θ( n\nM) over the baseline transmission\n\
    scheme, and the delay can be reduced by a factor of Θ(\n√\nnlogn\nM\n), where\
    \ M is the number\nof random projections required for reconstructing a snapshot,\
    \ and n is the number of\nrandomly deployed nodes. For the multi-sink case, their\
    \ architecture shows that the per-\nsession capacity of data gathering with CS\
    \ is Θ(\nn√nW\nMnd\n√\nnslogn), and the per-session delay is\nΘ(M\nq\nn\nlogn),\
    \ where W is the data rate. The number of sinks present in the network is nd,\n\
    and the number of randomly selected source nodes is ns. They validate the theoretical\n\
    results with simulations for the scaling laws of the capacity in both single-sink\
    \ and multi-\nsink networks.\n4. Medium Access Control (MAC)\nNext, we move to\
    \ the Data-Link layer and speciﬁcally to the medium access control\n(MAC) mechanism,\
    \ which highly affects the performance of data gathering protocols, as\nit inﬂuences\
    \ several performance aspects, such as reliability, latency, channel utilization,\n\
    power utilization (which impact the lifespan of a sensor in particular and the\
    \ network in\ngeneral), etc. Even though many access protocols were suggested\
    \ over the years for shared-\nchannel networks, wired and wireless, due to their\
    \ unique properties and requirements,\nextensive research has been conducted on\
    \ MAC protocols targeted to WSN. Many WSN\nMAC protocols were designed to comply\
    \ with various trafﬁc patterns. Accordingly, in the\nsequel, we provide a short\
    \ WSN-MAC protocol overview for ones that can support yet\nare not necessarily\
    \ particular to data-gathering. We review a fraction of the vast literature\n\
    on the topic and the numerous MAC protocols devised over the years. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ a\nschematic partition of the papers discussed throughout this section according\
    \ to the main\nMAC classes.\nMAC\nSection 4\nSynchronous \nTransmitter-Initiated\
    \ \nReceiver-Initiated \nAsynchronous \nOthers\nSection 4.2\nDuty-Cycle\nSection\
    \ 4.1\nFigure 3. Schematic description highlighting the main MAC classes covered\
    \ in the section.\nEnergy consumption is one of the main concerns of WSN, and\
    \ as previously explained,\nit needs to be considered in the design of protocols\
    \ and algorithms in all the layers of the\nprotocol stack. The highest energy\
    \ consumer of a sensor or an IoT device is its transceiver,\nwhich consumes energy\
    \ regardless of whether it is transmitting or only awake listening to\nongoing\
    \ trafﬁc (e.g., [75]). One of the more prevalent solutions to save power is to\
    \ embrace\na duty-cycle mechanism in which the device is asleep most of the time\
    \ (its transceiver is in\nlow power mode), and is awake for transmitting or receiving\
    \ data only a small fraction\nof the time. Another important aspect of wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSN) is channel\nutilization, that is, in a typical WSN, when\
    \ multiple devices are trying to send reports\nsimultaneously, air time is a crucial\
    \ network resource. Particularly when the network is\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    14 of 44\ndense with multiple devices in the same neighborhood, issues such as\
    \ coordinating between\nthe users to avoid collisions and preventing users from\
    \ occupying the channel for long\ntime intervals are fundamental. Note that such\
    \ issues can highly affect the performance in\na dense network topology even when\
    \ reports are not frequent. Accordingly, utilizing the\nchannel (air time) efﬁciently\
    \ is a crucial component for any such system’s operation and\nperformance. These\
    \ two highly vital aspects justify the signiﬁcance given to the design of\nmedium\
    \ access control (MAC) protocols that are particular to WSNs. Numerous protocols\n\
    have been suggested to cope with different WSN objectives and demands (e.g., [76,77]).\n\
    This paper focuses on MAC protocols for WSNs, particularly on duty-cycled-based\
    \ ones.\n4.1. Duty-Cycle MAC Protocols\nTraditionally, duty-cycle MAC protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed as either synchronous or\nasynchronous. In synchronous protocols\
    \ the awake time interval is synchronized such that\nall devices are awake (or\
    \ asleep) at the same time intervals (e.g., S-MAC [78], T-MAC [79]).\nSince the\
    \ awake time intervals are quite limited, they can be highly congested and prone\n\
    to collisions. Several synchronous protocols have devised mechanisms to attenuate\
    \ this\ncongestion and to allow more devices to transmit in each cycle, for example,\
    \ DW-MAC [80],\nwhich allocates the awake time for transmission reservations that\
    \ will be executed during\nthe sleep interval.\nIn asynchronous protocols, each\
    \ device has its own wake-up schedule. Accordingly,\nthe main challenge is setting\
    \ a rendezvous time when both the sender and the receiver are\nawake and devising\
    \ a signaling mechanism that informs both that they are awake and can\ncommunicate.\
    \ Asynchronous MAC protocols can further be divided into two categories,\ntransmitter-\
    \ or receiver-initiated. In transmitter-initiated protocols, the transmitter initiates\n\
    the transmission by capturing the channel waiting for its designated receiver\
    \ to wake\nup. For instance, in B-MAC [81], the transmitter transmits a long preamble\
    \ capturing the\nchannel prior to the data transmission, waiting for its intended\
    \ receiver to wake up and\nreply. In X-MAC [82], the transmitter transmits a sequence\
    \ of short preambles allowing\nthe intended receiver to interrupt, notifying the\
    \ receiver that it is awake. In WiseMAC [83],\nthe transmitter learns the wake-up\
    \ time of its intended receiver and starts the preamble\ntransmission just prior\
    \ to this wake-up time.\nThe second approach, the receiver-initiated paradigm,\
    \ relies on the receiver, whenever\nawake and ready to receive data, to initiate\
    \ the data exchange. The basic receiver-initiated\nMAC concept was introduced\
    \ in RI-MAC [84], in which whenever the receiver wakes up,\nit transmits a predeﬁned\
    \ preamble, signaling to its potential transmitters that it is awake\nand ready\
    \ to receive data. Several protocols took up the RI-MAC paradigm and suggested\n\
    modiﬁcations and enhancements. Some protocols strived to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    while a sender stays awake, waiting for its intended receiver to wake up. For\
    \ instance,\nPW-MAC [85] and AP-MAC [86] suggested that each transmitter will\
    \ learn its receiver’s\nexpected wake-up time, and instead of staying awake waiting\
    \ for its designated receiver to\nwake up, will wake up just before its intended\
    \ receiver’s wake-up instance.\nAnother receiver-initiated enhancement is suggested\
    \ by A-MAC [87], which aims to\nreduce the time in which a receiver and, consequently,\
    \ its potential transmitters stay awake,\nby trying to determine whether there\
    \ are pending packets for transmission and if it needs\nto stay awake or if it\
    \ can go back to sleep after probing the channel. The enhancement\nrelies on an\
    \ additional frame, termed “auto-ack”, sent by pending transmitters, which\nfollows\
    \ the receiver’s probe packet and proceeds with the data transmission. The “auto-ack”\n\
    frame is such that the receiver can decode a superposition of several such frames\
    \ and\ndetermine whether there is trafﬁc being sent. Even though the energy saved\
    \ per cycle is\nnegligible, the cumulative savings per day can be signiﬁcant due\
    \ to the numerous times\na device wakes up probing the channel. RIVER-MAC [88]\
    \ suggests two enhancements,\none aiming at reducing the awake time a sender is\
    \ waiting for its intended receiver to\nwake up, and one that aims at improving\
    \ the RI-MAC collision resolution mechanism by\nletting an active receiver keep\
    \ controlling the channel after invoking the collision resolution\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n15 of 44\nmechanism, and speciﬁcally during the silent backoff interval.\
    \ MAR-RiMAC [89] suggested\nan amendment to the receiver-initiated approach, and\
    \ in particular RI-MAC, to cope with\nthe perpetual collisions, common in dense\
    \ networks and heavy trafﬁc loads, in which\nmany devices are trying to transmit\
    \ to the same entity (sink or relay). MAR-RiMAC relies\non a reservation-based\
    \ mechanism in which the reservations are short signals that can\nbe transmitted\
    \ simultaneously. After the designated receiver decodes the identity of the\n\
    devices, it sends a transmission request and polls them sequentially, with no\
    \ idle intervals.\nAs mentioned in Section 2, relying on EH requires adaptations\
    \ that typically relate\nto the harvested energy source. For example, how to balance\
    \ the harvested energy and\nthe energy consumption can be a crucial factor in\
    \ whether or not a scheme or protocol\ncan be adopted by a network that relies\
    \ on EH, and can be the primary factor impacting\ntheir performance. Adaptation\
    \ requirements to support EH-based sensors span the whole\nnetwork stack, including\
    \ the MAC sublayer. Adaptation of receiver-initiated duty-cycle\nMAC protocol\
    \ for energy-harvesting-powered wireless sensor networks, in which besides\nthe\
    \ usual MAC challenges, both transmitter and receiver need to have sufﬁcient power\
    \ for\nsuccessful transmission, is given by Liu et al. [90].\n4.2. MAC Protocols\
    \ for Other Setups\nNext, we review some MAC protocols and MAC adaptations for\
    \ various setups,\nsuch as multi-channel, multi-radio, busy-tone utilization,\
    \ or different from the duty-cycle\napproach. DURI-MAC [91] adopts the traditional\
    \ busy-tone scheme and allocates a sub-\nchannel for control such that while receiving\
    \ data on the data channel, a busy signal\nis transmitted on the control channel,\
    \ which notiﬁes neighboring nodes of the ongoing\ntransmission, and therefore\
    \ helps avoid interference from hidden terminals. EM-MAC [92]\nutilizes multiple\
    \ orthogonal radio channels and allows devices to dynamically select the\nchannels\
    \ for their transmissions based on the channel conditions they sense without the\n\
    utilization of a control channel. Accordingly, EM-MAC can avoid using channels\
    \ that are\ncurrently heavily loaded, inferior due to interference, or jammed.\
    \ Typically, the trafﬁc\nload sent by a node is spatially and temporally variable.\
    \ Different nodes need to send\ndifferent trafﬁc loads due to their tasks, topological\
    \ location, and the amount of trafﬁc they\nneed to relay. Furthermore, the same\
    \ node can experience different loads at different time\nintervals due to events\
    \ or requests triggering different trafﬁc loads. Accordingly, several\nstudies\
    \ have explored an adaptive duty-cycle approach. For example, Ye and Zhang [93]\n\
    have developed a reinforcement-learning-based self-adaptive sleep/wake-up scheduling\n\
    approach. In the proposed method, each node (device) divides the time into time-slots,\n\
    which are not necessarily synchronized between neighboring nodes. Each node decides\n\
    whether to sleep or wake up in each time slot, and while awake, it decides whether\
    \ to listen\nor transmit. The decision is based on its current situation and its\
    \ estimation of its neighbors’\nsituations and is attained via Q-learning.\nGamm\
    \ et al. [94] devise an alternative approach to duty-cycle, which utilizes two\n\
    radios: the primary radio transceiver and an additional wake-up radio (WuR). The\
    \ wake-up\nradio is a low-power receiver triggered by an external event and can\
    \ turn on the main\ntransceiver when required. Oller et al. [95] provide a detailed\
    \ characterization of a speciﬁc\nWuR, the SubCarrier Modulation WuR (SCM-WuR),\
    \ through physical experiments and\nmeasurements, evaluating it for different\
    \ performance metrics and comparing it to other\nwake-up radio-based systems.\
    \ The authors of [95] model and simulate their own designed\nWuR hardware platform,\
    \ which is compared to four widely employed MAC protocols for\nWSN under three\
    \ real-world network deployments [96]. Spenza et al. [97] further design\nand\
    \ prototype a very-low-power-consumption (<1.3 µW), high-sensitivity (up to −55\
    \ dBm),\nfast-reactivity (wake-up time of 130 µs), and selective-addressing wake-up\
    \ receiver (WRx)\nand describe its integration to a wireless sensor node. The\
    \ authors leverage their WRx and\npresent ALBA-WUR, a cross-layer solution for\
    \ data gathering in wireless sensing systems.\nSimilar to duty-cycled MAC protocols,\
    \ wake-up radio-based protocols also distinguish\nbetween transmitter-initiated\
    \ WuR (TI-WuR) protocols in which the transmitter wakes up\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n16 of 44\nits potential receivers (e.g., [98,99]) vs. receiver-initiated\
    \ WuR (RI-WuR) that adopt the\nRI-MAC paradigm such that when a receiving node\
    \ is ready to collect data, it wakes up all\nthe nodes in its neighborhood by\
    \ broadcasting a wake-up call (e.g., [100,101]).\nAn energy-harvesting-based MAC\
    \ protocol for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is\nsuggested by Hawa et al. [102],\
    \ in which the secondary users (SUs) utilize the transmis-\nsions by primary users\
    \ (PUs) to harvest energy. Accordingly, the suggested protocol\ninterlaces SUs’\
    \ data transmissions within these PUs’ transmission holes. The proposed\nenergy-harvesting/data-transmission\
    \ schedule considers the imbalance between the small\namount of energy collected\
    \ per PU’s transmission and the energy required by an SU\ndata transmission.\n\
    Next, we mention several WSN MAC protocols that were specially designed for\n\
    particular data-gathering setups in WSN and IoT networks, exploiting the special\
    \ associ-\nated attributes (e.g., that the trafﬁc patterns are always from sensors\
    \ to the sink, or that\nthere exists a set of predeﬁned messages that need to\
    \ be sent). Cohen et al. [103] design\nand analyze a data collection protocol\
    \ based on information theoretic principles. In the\nsuggested protocol, each\
    \ sensor needs to convey one out of a bank of known messages\nto a sink. The protocol\
    \ assumes a large population of sensors and devises a scheme in\nwhich a sink\
    \ (or relay) can simultaneously collect messages from up to K sensors, without\n\
    knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without requiring any synchroniza-\n\
    tion, coordination, or management overhead. D-3 [104] exploits the fact that the\
    \ trafﬁc in\ndata-gathering applications ﬂows in a certain direction (toward a\
    \ single or multiple sinks)\nto devise a wake-up that can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ end-to-end delay. Speciﬁcally, D-3 lays\nout the awake schedule of communicating\
    \ nodes such that a packet can be forwarded\ntoward its destination sequentially,\
    \ without the need for a node to wait for its next-hop\nrelay to wake up (i.e.,\
    \ the wake-up schedule is such that a relay wakes up in time to receive\na packet\
    \ just received by its predecessor).\n5. Routing for Data Gathering in WSN\nWe\
    \ keep climbing the layers, and in this section we address issues related to the\n\
    Network layer. We start with a short review of WSN routing protocols. We note\
    \ that\nrouting-related aspects were also referred to in other sections of this\
    \ survey. We mainly\nfocus on the prominent and more recent protocols. We do not\
    \ provide a comprehensive\nreview of routing protocols in multihop WSNs and mainly\
    \ explore routing protocols\nsuitable for data gathering. Figure 4 provides a\
    \ schematic distribution of the discussed\npapers into main topics. As with the\
    \ schematic partition in the other sections, in order\nnot to have too many, the\
    \ topics are chosen such that the theme on each one encompasses\nseveral papers.\
    \ The papers’ partition is rough: some papers can appear in more than one\ntopic\
    \ while others are only related to the topic.\nWe start with general WSN settings\
    \ and then continue with routing protocols under\nenergy harvesting constraints.\
    \ Then we explore the utilization of network coding for data\ngathering, which\
    \ leverages the multi-hop routing, allowing relays (intermediate nodes)\nto code\
    \ the incoming packets before forwarding them toward the sink. We conclude this\n\
    section by examining a different paradigm. Rather than utilizing the traditional\
    \ approach of\nforwarding the sensed data via multiple relay nodes before reaching\
    \ the sink, this paradigm\nrelies on a Mobile Sink (MS) that traverses the network\
    \ and collects the sensed data from\nthe sensors it passes through.\n5.1. Common\
    \ WSN Routing Protocols for Data Gathering\nThe common setup for a data collection\
    \ network comprises a set of devices (e.g.,\nsensors) and one or multiple sinks\
    \ that collect the reports. In many such scenarios, the\nsensors are unevenly\
    \ dispersed over the terrain and in some cases can be mobile, can have\na different\
    \ distance to the sink(s), and the data needs to traverse multiple hops before\n\
    reaching the sink, in which commonly the sensors themselves serve as relays toward\n\
    the sink. Consequently, the performance experienced by different sensors (e.g.,\
    \ energy\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n17 of 44\nconsumption, latency, reliability)\
    \ can be markedly diverse. Various solutions, including\nenergy-aware routing,\
    \ compressed sensing, efﬁcient MAC novelties and architectural\ninnovations, have\
    \ been suggested to try to improve the overall performance and to balance\nits\
    \ variability; many are scattered throughout this survey under different subjects\
    \ (e.g.,\nSections 3, 4 and 6). In the sequel, we provide a brief review of routing\
    \ protocols for WSN\nin general and data gathering in particular.\nRouting\nSection\

    \ Cluster-Based Routing Protocols\nA signiﬁcant milestone in WSN routing protocols\
    \ is the low-energy adaptive clustering\nhierarchy (LEACH) protocol [105]. The\
    \ basic LEACH protocol is an adaptive clustering-\nbased protocol that dynamically\
    \ selects sensor nodes as cluster-heads. Each cluster-head\naggregates data from\
    \ its cluster members and relays it to the sink. In order to distribute\nthe high\
    \ energy consumption imposed on cluster-heads between all the sensor nodes,\n\
    the cluster-heads are dynamically selected according to a predeﬁned probability\
    \ that\ndepends on the number of desired clusters. The resulting protocol causes\
    \ continuous\nclustering hierarchy reelection, which facilitates energy balancing.\
    \ The original version\npresented by Heinzelman et al. [105] considers a setup\
    \ in which all sensor nodes can\ndirectly communicate with the sink; hence, each\
    \ cluster-head can directly relay the collected\ninformation from its cluster\
    \ members to the sink. However, as described in the paper,\nLEACH can be easily\
    \ extended to a hierarchical cluster setup in which the cluster-head\nnodes of\
    \ each tier are also organized in clusters such that each cluster-head relays\
    \ its\naggregated data to its higher-layer cluster-head, and so on up to the top\
    \ layer of the\nhierarchy, at which point the data are sent to the sink.\nSince\
    \ its publication in 2000, numerous protocols have relied on LEACH’s clustering\n\
    paradigm, suggesting enhancements and improvements for various setups and require-\n\
    ments. For instance, EE-LEACH [106,107] aims at improving the energy efﬁciency\
    \ of\nLEACH by considering the sensor’s residual energy throughout the stages\
    \ of the proto-\ncol. Speciﬁcally, EE-LEACH assumes that node deployment is implemented\
    \ according\nto a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. It forms clusters and\
    \ selects their respective\ncluster-heads based on the residual energy of neighboring\
    \ nodes. The relay nodes that\nforward the data aggregated by cluster-heads to\
    \ the sink are selected based on their residual\nenergy. A clustering procedure\
    \ based on recursive rectangular partitioning of the network\ngrid following the\
    \ k-d tree algorithm is demonstrated by Anzola et al. [108]. The authors\nadjust\
    \ a protocol that combines their clustering methods and report that it performs\
    \ better\nthan LEACH. Several surveys have summarized the successors of the LEACH\
    \ protocol\n(e.g., [107]).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n18 of 44\nPEGASIS [109] was\
    \ designed to address the overhead resulting from the cluster\nformation in LEACH.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, PEGASIS replaces the clusters with a node-chain in which\neach\
    \ node receives the data from its predecessor and transmits it to its successor\
    \ in the chain.\nThe data is gathered while getting fused along the chain until\
    \ eventually, a designated\nnode transmits it to the sink. PEGASIS relies on nodes\
    \ having global knowledge of the\nnetwork and shows that a simple greedy algorithm\
    \ for the forwarding chain construction,\nin which nodes select their closest\
    \ neighbors as the next hops in the chain, is sufﬁcient to\nsigniﬁcantly reduce\
    \ energy consumption. Similar to LEACH, and in order to balance the\nenergy depletion\
    \ in the network, different nodes transmit the fused data to the sink on\neach\
    \ data-gathering round. P-LEACH [110] offers a hybrid between LEACH and PEGASIS\n\
    that relies on cluster formation where cluster-heads collect and forward trafﬁc.\
    \ Rather\nthan forward the trafﬁc directly to the sink, or create a hierarchical\
    \ cluster setup in which\ncluster-heads are also grouped into clusters with another\
    \ cluster-head, P-LEACH adopts\nchain-based forwarding such that the cluster-heads\
    \ are arranged in a chain along which\nthe collected data is forwarded, as suggested\
    \ by PEGASIS.\nSeveral LEACH enhancements have relied on bio-inspired algorithms.\
    \ For example,\nSiew et al. [111] utilize adaptive particle swarm optimization\
    \ (APSO). This widely used\nswarm intelligence method mimics swarming behavior\
    \ in bird ﬂocking and ﬁsh schooling\nto guide its members to search for globally\
    \ optimal solutions for cluster-head location\nselection. Tam et al. [112] extend\
    \ LEACH to a 3D setting by employing a method based on\nfuzzy clustering and particle\
    \ swarm optimization (PSO). Cui et al. [113] suggest a variant\nof the bat algorithm,\
    \ which simulates bat prey echolocation behavior, to optimize the\ncluster-head\
    \ selection for LEACH protocol. A routing path selection using an ant colony\n\
    optimization algorithm is presented by Jiang and Zheng [114]. Clustering by mimicking\n\
    groups of yellow goatﬁsh is discussed by Rodríguez et al. [115]. The authors claim\
    \ that\nthe presented meta-heuristic is more efﬁcient in avoiding local minima.\
    \ An extension of\nLEACH for an IoT-designated industrial environment is presented\
    \ by Karunanithy and\nVelusamy [116]. This work provides uniform CH selection,\
    \ uniform CH dispersion over\nthe industrial grid of IoT-based sensors, and tree-based\
    \ routing selection that promises to\nbe more energy efﬁcient than known counterparts.\
    \ The energy exploitation is claimed to be\nequal among nodes.\nMehmood et al.\
    \ [117] devise a dynamic-size cluster-based routing protocol for WSN\ncomprising\
    \ a large number of sensors that are spread over a large area (the paper suggests\n\
    pollution monitoring as a candidate application). The primary objective of the\
    \ presented\nscheme is to effectively select CHs to be responsible for the main\
    \ communication with BS\nand additionally deﬁned chief nodes (CNs). Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the sensor topology is divided\ninto groups, where CNs collect the updated energy\
    \ indications of other sensors within a\ngroup. There are also border nodes responsible\
    \ for communication between groups. If\ntheir energy value drops below a threshold,\
    \ the CNs can be reelected. The candidates for\nCNs and CHs are provided by an\
    \ artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which takes as inputs\nremaining energy, neighboring\
    \ node count, the amount of outstanding data, signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR), distances\
    \ between nodes, CHs, CNs and the BS, trafﬁc load, and so\non. The simulations\
    \ show a better lifetime than other selected known protocols; hence,\nthe scheme\
    \ is a better ﬁt for pollution monitoring. Clustering and routing for a wind\n\
    turbine system monitored by WSN are introduced by Durairaj and Selvaraj [118].\
    \ The\ndiscussed environment is unique because sensors placed at wind turbines\
    \ can have their\nenergy replenished by the turbine itself; hence, these sensors\
    \ are always assumed to be\ncharged. However, the distances between turbines and\
    \ the BS are too large, and the\ngrid is augmented by ground sensors that relay\
    \ the measurements. In many cases, these\nground sensors have to act as CHs. The\
    \ authors propose system partitioning and clustering\nmethods that may be hierarchical\
    \ to speciﬁcally address this scenario. An interesting\nalgorithm that also employs\
    \ partitioning, by hierarchical grouping of sensors based on\nearly knowledge\
    \ of geographical transmission patterns in mobile WSN, is presented by\nShifrin\
    \ and Cidon [119].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n19 of 44\n5.1.2. Opportunistic Routing\n\
    The opportunistic routing approach, which was designed for wireless networks,\
    \ dy-\nnamically chooses paths toward the destination on a per-transmission basis,\
    \ Biswas and\nMorris [120], Ye and Hua [121]. Opportunistic routing exploits the\
    \ broadcast nature of\nwireless communication jointly with the spatial diversity\
    \ of distributed nodes in a given\nroute such that multiple nodes overhear each\
    \ packet transmitted by a node. The node that\nreceives the packet successfully\
    \ and can serve as the best relay toward the destination (e.g.,\nclosest to the\
    \ destination) becomes the next transmitting node. Harnessing opportunistic\n\
    routing to duty-cycle MAC protocols encounters several obstacles. In synchronous\
    \ duty-\ncycle MAC protocols (Section 4), the short time duration in which all\
    \ nodes are awake (and\nspeciﬁcally, all the potential relays are awake and trying\
    \ to forward the same packet) can\nlead to artiﬁcial congestion and poor wake-time\
    \ utilization. In asynchronous duty-cycle\nMAC protocols, since not all nodes\
    \ are awake simultaneously, the use of overhearing, which\nopportunistic routing\
    \ relies on, is limited and requires adaptations such that the transmitter\nwill\
    \ transmit to multiple relays upon its wake-up (e.g., [122]) or delay its transmission,\n\
    choosing its relay opportunistically based on channel condition (e.g., [123]).\n\
    In a dense WSN, even under asynchronous duty-cycle MAC protocol, several potential\n\
    relays can be awake simultaneously, which poses additional challenges when utilizing\n\
    opportunistic routing. In addition to the relay selection problem—whether a transmitter\n\
    should wait for the best relay to wake up or compromise on a less preferable relay,\
    \ reducing\nits awake period and how long it should wait—it also encounters the\
    \ collision avoidance\nproblem between simultaneously awake nodes. Liu et al.\
    \ [124] suggest a slotted contention-\nbased scheme in which, following a probe\
    \ sent by the transmitter, the awakened potential\nrelays contend and transmit\
    \ feedback concerning the routing progress they can offer. The\ntransmitter selects\
    \ the best possible relay out of the ones that replied, taking into account\n\
    not only the metric chosen to evaluate the different relays, but also the waiting\
    \ time of\nthe link-layer transmissions. Under a similar set-up of dense asynchronous\
    \ duty-cycle\nMAC protocol with multiple potential relays awake simultaneously,\
    \ Hawbani et al. [125]\ntry to control the number of potential forwarders, which\
    \ inﬂuences both the transmitter\nwaiting time and the number of packet duplications.\
    \ The suggested solution relies on\na two-step mechanism. First, each transmitter\
    \ determines a candidate zone such that all\nnodes within the candidate zone are\
    \ potential forwarders. Second, the candidates within\nthe candidate zone are\
    \ prioritized based on a combination of metrics that considers residual\nenergy,\
    \ transmitting direction, distance, and link quality.\n5.1.3. Routing Protocol\
    \ for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)\nA routing protocol for low-power and\
    \ lossy networks (RPL) is a routing protocol\nthat was speciﬁcally designed for\
    \ networks composed of constrained nodes, which are\ninterconnected via unstable\
    \ and lossy links with relatively low packet delivery rates and\ntypically only\
    \ support low data rates (hence, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs)).\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ RPL is a distance-vector proactive routing protocol designed for IPv6 low-\n\
    power devices with limited energy, processing, and memory resources (Winter et\
    \ al. [126]).\nRPL constructs a tree routing topology termed the destination-oriented\
    \ directed acyclic\ngraph (DODAG), rooted at one or more sink nodes. The routing\
    \ tree (graph), along\nwhich the trafﬁc traverses, is constructed according to\
    \ an objective function (OF) that can\nutilize a set of metrics such as energy\
    \ consumption, latency, and hop count. The most\ncommon ones are OF0, which ﬁnds\
    \ the shortest path (the path with the minimal hop-count)\nto the sink (Thubert\
    \ et al. [127]), and minimum rank with hysteresis objective function\n(MRHOF),\
    \ which ﬁnds the routes that minimize the link cost associated with the routes\n\
    (Gnawali and Levis [128]). The cost is deﬁned as the latency metric allowing RPL\
    \ to ﬁnd\nstable minimum-latency paths from each node to the sink, or it can be\
    \ associated with the\nexpected transmission count (ETX) metric, which allows\
    \ RPL to ﬁnd the stable minimum-\nETX paths from the nodes to the sink (the default\
    \ metric). In order to achieve stability,\nMRHOF also ensures that a route is\
    \ changed (a node exchanges its preferred parent in\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    20 of 44\nthe routing tree) only if the cost of the improved route is better than\
    \ the current route by\nat least a predeﬁned threshold. RPL is the de-facto IPv6-based\
    \ routing protocol for the\nIoT. Accordingly, several OFs and possible enhancements\
    \ have emerged during recent\nyears, and several performance evaluations and comparisons\
    \ have been presented. In the\nfollowing, we discuss some of these OFs.\nAbdel\
    \ Hakeem et al. [129] analyze the performance of RPL in collecting smart meter\n\
    readings over smart grid (SG) networks via Java-based simulations and IoT-LAB\
    \ testbed ex-\nperiments. Speciﬁcally, Ref. [129] evaluates the RPL performance\
    \ under the two prominent\nobjective functions Hop Count and ETX, in terms of\
    \ packet delivery ratio, network latency,\ncontrol trafﬁc overhead, and power\
    \ consumption. Barnawi et al. [130] utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to examine\
    \ the performance of RPL under duty-cycle MAC protocol.\nSpeciﬁcally, Ref. [130]\
    \ simulates RPL over the classical XMAC protocol and its derivative\nContikiMac,\
    \ where, rather than using a long preamble waiting for the receiver to wake up,\n\
    the sender repeatedly sends the same packet until a link layer acknowledgment\
    \ is received.\nAs a baseline, Ref. [130] uses NullRDC, an always-awake node.\
    \ As expected, the results\nshow that NullRDC is better in terms of latency, while\
    \ ContikiMac outperforms the others\nin terms of power consumption. Al-Shargabi\
    \ and Aleswid [131] also utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to evaluate which\
    \ OF is more suitable for a WSN in healthcare scenarios.\nOF0 and ETX are examined\
    \ in various network topologies, such as the grid and random\ntopology, under\
    \ diverse densities. They conclude that the OF0 is more efﬁcient with respect\n\
    to packet delivery ratio (PDR) and power consumption in the random topology setup.\n\
    Sousa et al. [132] propose an energy-efﬁcient and path-reliability-aware objective\n\
    function (ERAOF). The OF suggested by ERAOF linearly combines energy consumption\n\
    and link quality (in terms of ETX) routing metrics. Even though the selected routes\
    \ are\nnot optimal in either one of the objective metrics, they provide a balance\
    \ between energy\nefﬁciency and reliability. Rafea and Kadhim [133] suggest an\
    \ energy threshold RPL (ETRPL),\nwhich, in addition to the ETX metric, incorporates\
    \ in its objective function the remaining\nenergy of the preferred forwarding\
    \ (parent) node. ETRPL performance is evaluated via\nCooja simulator. Sharma et\
    \ al. [134] suggest another MRHOF-based objective function that\ntakes into account\
    \ three routing metrics: ETX, energy, and delay. Energy consumption,\nin order\
    \ to increase the lifespan of the network, is also considered by Sankar et al.\
    \ [135],\nwhich suggests cluster-tree-based routing protocol to maximize the lifetime\
    \ of IoT (CT-\nRPL). As the name suggests, CT-RPL is a cluster-based routing protocol\
    \ that involves three\nprocesses: cluster formation, cluster-head selection, and\
    \ route establishment. CT-RPL ﬁrst\nscans the nodes and group (cluster) nodes\
    \ whose Euclidean distance from their centroid\npoint is bounded, adding one node\
    \ at a time. Next, each cluster selects its cluster-head\n(CH), utilizing a game-theoretic\
    \ approach in which the node with the maximum payoff\n“p” value—which considers\
    \ parameters such as residual energy, sensing energy, receiving\nenergy, aggregation\
    \ energy, and transmission energy—is selected as the CH node for each\nround.\
    \ Finally, the route is established using the metrics residual energy ratio (RER),\
    \ queue\nutilization (QU), and expected transmission count (ETX).\nAnother RPL\
    \ enhancement termed weighted random forward RPL (WRF-RPL) is\nproposed by Acevedo\
    \ et al. [136]. WRF-RPL suggests a load balancing over RPL mechanism,\nwhich distributes\
    \ the trafﬁc between multiple transmission paths, trying to avoid one\npreferred\
    \ parent’s congestions. WRF-RPL OF relies on the composition of two metrics, the\n\
    remaining energy and the count of parent nodes, where the latter aims at prioritizing\
    \ parent\nnodes with more optional paths to the destination. Forwarding decisions\
    \ are probabilistic\naccording to the deﬁned metric, such that nodes with a higher\
    \ number of parents or hops\nare more likely to be selected than others. The authors\
    \ utilize the Cooja simulator for\nevaluation. Rojas et al. [137] leverage a wired\
    \ data center network labeling protocol to\nsuggest IoTorii, a routing protocol\
    \ for LLNs. IoTorii supports multiple paths between\nsender and receiver, and\
    \ requires fewer table entries and control messages, with similar\nperformance\
    \ compared to the standard RPL.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n21 of 44\nMolnár [138]\
    \ provides a graph-theoretic solution to the general problem of QoS-\nconstrained\
    \ routing in WSN that relies on RPL. The authors stress the difference between\n\
    multi-objective optimization and multi-constrained problem setting. Vera-Pérez\
    \ et al. [139]\nexamine the integration of RPL to IEEE 802.15.4e with time-slotted\
    \ channel-hopping (TSCH)\nmedium access mechanism. In particular, Ref. [139] characterizes\
    \ the long deployment\ndelays required for such networks to become operational\
    \ and able to start exchanging data\nmessages. The article proposes an analytical\
    \ model that estimates the average time that the\nsynchronization process can\
    \ take for a new node to join a TSCH-based network, as well as\nan estimation\
    \ of the maximum time required for the formation of a complete network of\nthis\
    \ kind, and the additional time required to set the RPL-based routes. The paper\
    \ validates\nthe analytical model via simulations. A recent comprehensive survey\
    \ on routing protocols\nfor LLN networks in IoT (not exclusive to RPL) can be\
    \ found in [140].\n5.2. Data Aggregation Routing Protocols for Energy Harvesting\
    \ WSN\nAs discussed in Section 2, an alternative for relying on batteries as the\
    \ source of energy,\nwith their imposed constraints (e.g., size, replacement,\
    \ etc.), is to embrace energy-harvesting\n(EH) technology. However, as mentioned\
    \ earlier, relying on EH imposes different con-\nstraints and limitations. Such\
    \ constraints can make battery-reliant schemes impractical\nwhen devising data\
    \ collection procedures. When battery-reliant schemes are applied to\nEH-based\
    \ platforms, performance can be highly degraded. Speciﬁcally, relying on EH can\n\
    induce high diversity between the different nodes, as different nodes can have\
    \ different\nattributes, such as energy depletion and charging rates, which affect\
    \ the nodes’ availability;\nin addition, different nodes can have different roles,\
    \ such as different reporting rates or\ndifferent report importance, requiring\
    \ more energy usage, which eventually also affects the\nnodes’ availability. When\
    \ a sensor is expected to transmit or receive a report, it needs to\nhave sufﬁcient\
    \ energy to complete the transaction; therefore, reliance on EH needs to be\n\
    considered when designing a scheduling protocol. For example, a data collection\
    \ scheme\nthat relies on EH should adapt the report rate to energy availability;\
    \ it can compromise\nthe rate of less important reports coming from the sensors\
    \ to leave them sufﬁcient energy\nfor emergency reports. It can prioritize sensors\
    \ with more energy over those with lower\nenergy, especially when there is some\
    \ redundancy in the reports received by different\nsensors. This is especially\
    \ so when dealing with multi-hop routing, where many of the\nnodes serve as relays\
    \ and have the burden to stay awake longer, to receive and transmit\nmore, which\
    \ escalates the heterogeneity of the nodes and accentuates the difference in\n\
    importance between the different nodes. Furthermore, if on a single-hop network,\
    \ we\ncould rely on the receiver (sink) to have unlimited power (connected to\
    \ a power source), in\nmulti-hop topologies also, the receivers rely on EH; hence,\
    \ when scheduling a transmission,\nwe need to ensure that both transmitter and\
    \ receiver have sufﬁcient power to complete the\ntransaction. In the following,\
    \ we present several routing protocol adaptations for EH-WSN\nin the context of\
    \ data aggregation.\nThe typical setup considers that each node (sensor) encompasses\
    \ an energy har-\nvester and an energy storage device and is solely powered by\
    \ the renewable energy\navailable to it by its energy storage device. A multi-hop\
    \ topology is considered such\nthat the data from many of the sensors need to\
    \ traverse multiple links before reaching the\nsink. Jeong et al. [141] propose\
    \ an adaptive data aggregation scheme for energy-harvesting\nWSNs. The suggested\
    \ scheme relies on two residual-energy thresholds, lower and upper.\nEach node\
    \ periodically estimates its residual energy level to determine whether or not\
    \ to\ntransmit data. When the node’s residual energy is either above the upper\
    \ threshold or\nbelow the lower threshold, the node transmits its aggregated data.\
    \ If its energy is below\nthe lower threshold, the node enters energy-saving mode\
    \ after transmitting the data. Its\nradio is turned off, and it waits to regain\
    \ sufﬁcient energy before turning its radio back\non. In normal operation mode,\
    \ where the residual energy is between the two thresholds,\nthe node only aggregates\
    \ data received from other nodes and collects its own sensed data.\nIf a node’s\
    \ aggregated data in normal mode exceeds its storage limit, the node transmits\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n22 of 44\nthe data regardless of its residual energy.\
    \ While this scheme is clear and straightforward\nto implement, it lacks latency\
    \ evaluation and a discussion about rendezvous between a\ntransmitter and a receiver.\n\
    Chen et al. [142] experimentally show that in energy-harvesting-based wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks (EH-WSNs), the required nodes’ charging time to be ready to\
    \ receive or send a\npacket is much greater than the time required for the contention\
    \ resolution mechanism and\ndominates the data aggregation latency. In addition\
    \ to the common collision deﬁnitions, the\npaper deﬁnes an “energy-collision”,\
    \ which occurs due to battery level constraint and not\ndue to simultaneous transmissions.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, energy-collision occurs when a transmitter-\nreceiver tuple is\
    \ scheduled for transmission, but the transmission cannot take place because\n\
    at least one of the two nodes has insufﬁcient energy to transmit or receive the\
    \ packet due\nto recent activity (insufﬁcient time has elapsed since its last\
    \ transmission or reception to\nharvest enough energy for the subsequent scheduled\
    \ transmission). An adaptable data\naggregation tree is constructed, which considers\
    \ each node’s residual and harvested energy,\nand three energy-collision-aware\
    \ data aggregation algorithms are proposed.\n5.2.1. Cluster-Based Routing Protocol\
    \ That Relies on EH\nSeveral studies have suggested various adaptations for LEACH\
    \ WSN cluster-based\nrouting protocol (e.g., [106]) for EH-based WSN (EH-WSN).\
    \ Recall that LEACH’s cluster-\nhead selection mechanism randomly selects sensor\
    \ nodes as cluster-heads to distribute\nthe energy consumption between them evenly,\
    \ which can seemingly cope with the EH\nconstraints. However, note that even when\
    \ the nodes’ platform is exactly the same, the\npotential of different nodes to\
    \ harvest energy, dependent on their speciﬁc ambient con-\nditions, can be very\
    \ different. Furthermore, the node’s location with respect to the sink\ncan highly\
    \ inﬂuence the amount of data it needs to relay toward the sink, causing high\n\
    discrepancies between the energy utilized by various nodes. To cope with these\
    \ discrepan-\ncies, Xiao et al. [143] modify LEACH’s cluster-head selection mechanism\
    \ and deﬁne a new\nmetric termed “energy potential function” to measure each node’s\
    \ capability to harvest\nenergy. The paper devises a cluster-head selection strategy\
    \ that prioritizes nodes with\nhigher expected stored energy (based on the currently\
    \ available energy and their potential\nenergy) to become cluster-heads, regardless\
    \ of the number of instances that the node was\nselected as cluster-head in the\
    \ past.\nTo address the imbalance between the energy expected to be consumed by\
    \ cluster-\nheads (CHs) that are closer to the sink and are expected to spend\
    \ more energy on relaying\npackets from farther clusters, and CHs that are further\
    \ from the sink and expected to relay\nless trafﬁc, Wu et al. [144] suggest an\
    \ unbalanced clustering mechanism. In particular,\ncluster sizes are determined\
    \ according to the distance (hop count) to the sink to balance the\nenergy consumption\
    \ of the CHs. Accordingly, clusters closer to the sink, which are expected\nto\
    \ relay more inter-cluster trafﬁc, will be smaller, so that they collect less\
    \ intra-cluster\ntrafﬁc; clusters further away from the sink and expected to relay\
    \ less inter-cluster trafﬁc\nwill comprise more nodes, so that they collect more\
    \ intra-cluster trafﬁc. The mechanism\nsuggested to attain this balance is partitioning\
    \ the network conceptually into concentric\nrings around the sink with linearly\
    \ increasing radii. Each ring comprises nodes with\nthe same hop distance to the\
    \ sink. Clusters within the same ring will have the same\nsize. CH selection is\
    \ designed to balance the loads of each ring considering the available\nnodes’\
    \ energy, which is evaluated based on the EH rate. Following a similar approach,\n\
    Yang et al. [145] assume a highly symmetric circular sensor network in which the\
    \ sink\n(BS) is located at the center, and the sensors are distributed evenly\
    \ in a disc around it.\nAs with [144], the sensor ﬁeld is divided into concentric\
    \ rings; however, in this study,\nthe rings are determined to have an equal area\
    \ such that the number of sensors in each\nring is expected to be the same. Under\
    \ the given model, Ref. [145] analyzes the energy\nconsumption of intra- and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmission and derives the energy neutrality\nconstraints, which guarantee\
    \ that each node consumes less energy than the amount of\nenergy it has harvested.\
    \ The authors further devise a constraint formula of the number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n23 of 44\nclusters required in each layer (ring) that balances the\
    \ average energy consumption of nodes\nin different layers. The energy neutrality\
    \ constraints and the cluster parameters are used to\nobtain the parameters (number\
    \ of rings, number of clusters in each ring, and minimum\nnetwork data transmission\
    \ cycle) that minimize the data transmission cycle. Based on the\nattained parameters,\
    \ the cluster-based routing protocol is derived. The protocol consists\nof an\
    \ initialization phase and repeated cycles divided into topology formation and\
    \ data-\ngathering phases. Bahbahani and Alsusa [146] suggest two separate enhancements.\
    \ The\nﬁrst, termed cooperative transmission strategy, enables nodes to serve\
    \ as relays to relay\nundelivered packets from cluster members to CHs and from\
    \ CHs to the sink node. The\nsecond mechanism, termed cluster-head duty-cycle,\
    \ regulates the frequency at which a node\ncan become a CH based on duty-cycling\
    \ that adapts to the node’s energy-harvesting rate.\nTo conserve the energy of\
    \ nodes that are more susceptible to energy depletion,\nBozorgi et al. [147] select\
    \ CHs, taking into account their residual energy, expected har-\nvest energy,\
    \ distance from the sink, number of neighbors, and, similar to LEACH, the\nnumber\
    \ of times a node has already served as a CH in the past. The proposed approach,\n\
    which combines centralized and distributed mechanisms, relies on a signal transmitted\n\
    by the sink that can be received by all the nodes, which allows them to estimate\
    \ their\ngeographic distance from the sink. The network is partitioned by the\
    \ sink into four layers\nbased on distance. The sink further computes the individual\
    \ coverage radius of each node\n(potential CH) based on distance (nodes closer\
    \ to the sink, which are therefore expected\nto relay trafﬁc coming from more\
    \ distant clusters, will have a smaller radius, and thus\nless intra-cluster trafﬁc;\
    \ on the other hand, nodes farther away from the sink, which are\ntherefore expected\
    \ to have less inter-cluster trafﬁc to relay, are assigned a longer radius,\n\
    and therefore more intra-cluster trafﬁc). The paper suggests a distributed contention-based\n\
    mechanism for selecting the CHs in which the contention window takes into account\
    \ the\nparameters mentioned above. Another cluster-based routing for EH-WSN is\
    \ proposed by\nRen and Yao [148]. The proposed routing scheme is divided into\
    \ cluster establishment and\ndata collection. It is suggested that besides the\
    \ typical cluster members (CMs) and cluster-\nhead (CH), a new entity be devised,\
    \ termed in the paper scheduling node (SN), which is\ndifferent from the CH. The\
    \ main task of the SN is to monitor the energy of all the cluster\nmembers during\
    \ the data collection stage and select a CH based on the monitored residual\n\
    energy of the cluster members. The transmission range of nodes can also be adjusted\
    \ based\non their residual energy. The data collection stage, which adapts a round-based\
    \ scheme\nsimilar to LEACH, is divided into the data transmission and CH selection\
    \ stages.\nSinde et al. [149] aim to improve the network efﬁciency by three means:\
    \ (i) clusteriza-\ntion mechanism that takes into account energy consumption during\
    \ the data aggregation\nphase, (ii) duty cycle adaptation of each node such that\
    \ each sensor node determines its\nmode of operation, and (iii) routing mechanism\
    \ based on ant colony optimization that\nchooses the path between the source and\
    \ the sink node that reduces the delay incurred.\nOverall, while the paper jointly\
    \ addresses several topics in WSN, including those connected\nto energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data gathering, its main contribution is the detailed NS3 simulation.\n5.2.2.\
    \ Mobile Charger\nToday’s technology enables dedicated wireless charging equipment\
    \ (WCE) to recharge\nthe nodes’ batteries, prolonging the lifetime of wireless\
    \ rechargeable sensor networks.\nA model in which, in addition to the sink (base\
    \ station), a mobile station will navigate\nthrough the WSN to collect data and\
    \ charge sensor nodes is considered by Liu et al. [150].\nThe paper suggests a\
    \ joint routing and charging strategy. The joint problem is decomposed\ninto two\
    \ sub-optimization problems: routing tree optimization and charging path optimiza-\n\
    tion. Heuristic algorithms based on simulated annealing algorithms were applied\
    \ to solve\nthese sub-optimization problems.\nA joint charging and routing algorithm\
    \ with WCE-assisted data gathering is also\nsuggested by Lu et al. [151]. The\
    \ model suggested therein assumes that the BS (sink) can\nget the information\
    \ of each node at any time, including node location, residual energy,\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n24 of 44\nand energy consumption rate. The suggested approach\
    \ relates to data routing and energy\nsupplement to undercharged nodes. The data\
    \ routing algorithm considers several factors:\nsensor buffer occupancy, load,\
    \ and energy. To ﬁnd the route for the mobile recharging\nunit to traverse, they\
    \ rely on Du [152] to seek the shortest Hamiltonian cycle between the\nnodes that\
    \ urgently need energy replenishment traversed by the mobile recharging unit.\n\
    Additional nodes along the traversed path can also be charged. Furthermore, the\
    \ mobile\nrecharging unit can also gather data from sensors with a critical buffer\
    \ occupancy during\nits recharging cycle.\nIn the following section, we discuss\
    \ network coding (NC) and, in particular, linear\nnetwork coding in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\n5.3. Network Coding (NC)\nNetwork coding leverages\
    \ the routing protocols and the ability to construct multi-path\nrouting between\
    \ sources and their destination (the sink) to enable intermediate nodes to\nperform\
    \ coding on the incoming packets before forwarding them. In the following section,\n\
    we discuss network-coding-related works.\nLinear network coding was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ by Celebiler and Stette [153] and evolved in\nthe seminal paper by Ahlswede\
    \ et al. [154] as a means to improve the network’s throughput,\nefﬁciency, and\
    \ scalability, which can also be leveraged to improve the network resilience\n\
    to attacks and eavesdropping. Linear network coding allows the network’s intermediate\n\
    nodes (e.g., relays) to accumulate arriving messages and forward a newly encoded\
    \ message,\nwhich is a linear combination of the accumulated packets, multiplying\
    \ them by coefﬁcients\nchosen from a ﬁnite ﬁeld. The manner in which nodes encode\
    \ and decode messages de-\npends on the selected coding scheme. Network coding\
    \ (NC) over wireless communication\ncan reduce the number of transmissions by\
    \ leveraging the fact that a single transmission is\noverheard by multiple nodes\
    \ in the transmitter’s vicinity, and can therefore be utilized by\neach of these\
    \ nodes, which will forward a coded packet with unique coefﬁcients comprising\n\
    its own message and the messages it overheard (e.g., [155]).\nIn WSNs, NC can\
    \ be utilized for various trafﬁc patterns, including data dissemination\n(one-to-many\
    \ communication) and data gathering. Works on energy-efﬁcient NC-based\ndissemination\
    \ can be followed in the survey [156], with multi-hop routing being empha-\nsized.\
    \ In data dissemination in which the base station/sink distributes information\
    \ to\nthe sensor nodes, NC is beneﬁcial mainly for distributing control messages\
    \ (broadcast or\nmulticast trafﬁc) or, in case of unicast trafﬁc, for recovering\
    \ lost packets (retransmissions).\nThe latter utilization relies on the fact that\
    \ different nodes heard or did not hear different\npackets. Accordingly, nodes\
    \ store packets they overheard, even if not destined to them-\nselves. The transmitter\
    \ (e.g., access-point) accumulates several packets that need to be\nretransmitted,\
    \ each for a different receiver. It transmits a coded packet that is a composite\n\
    of these accumulated packets. Each receiver can decode a missing packet by utilizing\
    \ its\nstored overheard packets (e.g., [157–162], where the last two mainly focus\
    \ on data dis-\nsemination of control management messages. It is noteworthy that\
    \ Cohen et al. [157] also\npresent a successful real HW radio deployment of their\
    \ scheme. XOR-CoW [163] exploits\nthe same concept to design an IoT protocol in\
    \ which relays transmit coded packets that\nmix downlink and uplink trafﬁc. Similar\
    \ to other previously mentioned studies, the coding\nscheme by Swamy et al. [163]\
    \ is over ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld of size 2 (GF(2)) (i.e., XORing the\ncoded packets).\n\
    Network coding is widely explored for data-gathering schemes. Typically, an NC-\n\
    based protocol involves both the coding scheme and the multi-path routing. It\
    \ relies on\nthe relay nodes to overhear packets and perform the coding, and on\
    \ the sink (or multiple\nsinks) to collect sufﬁcient coded packets (combinations)\
    \ to encode the sent information.\nThe limited ability of the sensors constrains\
    \ NC over WSN (e.g., limited storage to store\noverheard packets, limited computation\
    \ power to perform sophisticated operations, limited\nawake time for packet overhearing,\
    \ etc.). The utilized coding scheme inﬂuences the\nperformance of the NC algorithm\
    \ in several aspects such as the throughput, algorithm\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    25 of 44\ncomplexity, encoding complexity, decoding complexity, packet overhead\
    \ (bits), required\nfeedback, and so on. Note that many of these metrics are directly\
    \ translated to air time\nand energy consumption, which must be considered in\
    \ WSN. The random linear network\ncoding (RLNC) encoding scheme (e.g., [164])\
    \ is widely used because, despite its simplicity,\nit can attain throughput that\
    \ is close to the optimal one using a decentralized algorithm.\nIn RLNC, relays\
    \ transmit random linear combinations of the packets they receive, with\nrandomly\
    \ chosen coefﬁcients from a ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld (GF). The receiver must obtain a\n\
    sufﬁcient number of linearly independent combinations (packets) to decode the\
    \ original\npackets. If the GF size is sufﬁciently large, the probability that\
    \ the randomly generated\ncombinations will be linearly independent is high. However,\
    \ the receiver needs to know the\ncoefﬁcient used in each combination; hence,\
    \ it needs to be sent as overhead piggybacked on\neach traversed packet. The larger\
    \ the GF size, the higher the overhead. RLNC scheme with\ndistributed encoding\
    \ was utilized by Stefanovi´c et al. [165] for a perimeter data-gathering\nobjective,\
    \ in which the data should reach the perimeter nodes that are located on the\n\
    boundary of the covered area. The proposed scheme does not deploy routing algorithms\
    \ or\nmaintain routing information and relies on random walks.\nOne disadvantage\
    \ of RLNC is its decoding complexity in the order of O(n3), where n\ndenotes the\
    \ number of original packets. Sparse end-to-end erasure-correcting codes can\n\
    reduce the decoding load on the receiver at the cost of introducing an additional,\
    \ non-\nnegligible delay. Feizi et al. [166] suggest a tunable sparse network\
    \ coding (TSNC) scheme\nthat tunes the level of sparsity as the transmission process\
    \ evolves. This tuning process\ncan reduce the delay overhead by using denser\
    \ codes towards the end of the transmission\nwhile maintaining the complexity\
    \ advantages of a sparse code. Prior et al. [167] propose\ntwo network coding\
    \ schemes for information gathering, which are based on tunable sparse\ncodes,\
    \ with and without explicit feedback from the sink. The suggested schemes are\n\
    designed for meter readings in a smart grid. Nistor et al. [168] further exploit\
    \ RLNC and\nTSNC for data gathering and derived analytical bounds for a multi-hop\
    \ line network using\na ﬂuid model, which is valid for any ﬁeld size and various\
    \ sparsity levels, and has two\ndifferent feedback mechanisms.\nSenseCode [169]\
    \ adopts the NC paradigm, aspiring to balance energy efﬁciency and\nend-to-end\
    \ packet error rate. SenseCode relies on nodes transmitting both uncoded and\n\
    coded packets. Each node stores only a small portion of the packets it overhears,\
    \ which can\nbe attained by letting the node wake up sporadically within its duty\
    \ cycle and stay awake\nfor a short time interval each time it wakes up, storing\
    \ overheard packets. Accordingly,\neach coded packet comprises only a small subset\
    \ of the packets the node could have\npotentially overheard and coded. NetCoDer\
    \ [170] concentrates on a star topology in\nwhich the star-head can be a sink\
    \ or a relay that collects information from its neighbors.\nNetCoDer opportunistically\
    \ selects, based on network conditions, a set of relays that, in\naddition to\
    \ the data sent by the nodes, send additional coded packets with packets they\n\
    overheard, which helps the star-head recover lost packets. To reduce the overhead,\
    \ the\nrelays use LNC coefﬁcients based on the addresses of the sensor nodes.\
    \ A similar idea\nthat also does not rely on feedback was presented in SR-Code\
    \ [171] in which nodes and\nrelays send redundant coded messages to help the sink\
    \ recover lost messages. SR-Code\nutilizes the XOR operator (GF(2)). Similar to\
    \ NetCoDer, SR-Code reduces the overhead\nby using a bitmap to identify the coded\
    \ packets rather than the address of the sending\nnode. Al-Hawri et al. [172]\
    \ assume a data-gathering setup with single or multiple gateways\n(sinks) that\
    \ can collaborate (exchange information via accessible shared distributed storage\n\
    system). The paper distinguishes between traditional relays, which forward packets\
    \ they\nreceive as-is, and encoding relays, which perform network-coding on the\
    \ packets they\nreceive before forwarding them. The authors suggest a mathematical\
    \ model and a heuristic\nalgorithm to determine the number of network-encoding\
    \ nodes and their location, which\nis insufﬁcient for the aggregate received data\
    \ at the gateway/gateways to be decodable,\ntaking into account link failure scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n26 of 44\nProtocols that utilize NC in WSN need to balance\
    \ achieving the NC expedience and\ndiverse performance criteria. On the one hand,\
    \ the motivation is to send only coded packets,\nas sending uncoded packets degrades\
    \ the NC gain. On the other hand, a strategy in which\na relay waits for packets\
    \ to arrive in order to code them can yield unacceptable delays.\nFurthermore,\
    \ storing arriving packets while waiting for additional packets to arrive before\n\
    coding them can result in a buffer overﬂow and packet loss. To overcome these\
    \ drawbacks,\nChen et al. [173] suggest an opportunistic network coding (ONC)\
    \ approach in which the\nrelay can transmit either coded or uncoded packets. Each\
    \ relay determines whether to\ntransmit a coded or uncoded packet according to\
    \ its queue state at each transmission\nopportunity. For the simple topology of\
    \ a relay interconnecting two nodes that communi-\ncate with one another, Ref.\
    \ [173] presents an ONC strategy that can achieve the optimal\ndelay/power tradeoff.\
    \ Mirani et al. [174] adopt the ONC paradigm for data dissemination\nin vehicular\
    \ ad hoc networks (VANETs), for which the mobile nodes (vehicles) employ a\ndecode-and-forward\
    \ scheme with subjective timers determined according to their distance\nfrom the\
    \ source. In Tan et al. [175], an opportunistic routing protocol with opportunistic\n\
    network coding is proposed for correlated data gathering.\nNext, we provide more\
    \ recent works that utilize NC in WSNs and related networks\nthat are not particular\
    \ to data-gathering applications. Marques et al. [176] propose to use\nNC in a\
    \ fog computing scenario, since in the fog computing system architecture, the\
    \ data\nmeasured on a node should be delivered to many other destination nodes.\
    \ The authors\ndesign a protocol for encoding and decoding and provide a design\
    \ to incorporate it on\nthe MAC level. Uwitonze et al. [177] consider a setup\
    \ in which a WSN has been split into\nmultiple disjoint partitions and suggests\
    \ a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on\nspace network coding termed\
    \ relay placement using space network coding (i.e., rather than\nsend additional\
    \ coded data, additional relay nodes are deployed) for ﬁnding the optimal\nnumber\
    \ and positions to place relay nodes for restoring the network connectivity.\n\
    A network coding backpressure routing scheme for data aggregation in large-scale\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) networks is explored by Malathy et al. [178]. The proposed\
    \ routing\nscheme exploits network coding for the data aggregation process, which\
    \ improves the\nthroughput of the network by eliminating redundant packets. The\
    \ paper relies on cluster-\nbased routing that selects the cluster-heads (CH)\
    \ based on the available energy and distance,\nwhich helps to minimize trafﬁc\
    \ congestion and provide efﬁcient data transmission.\n5.4. Data Collection Utilizing\
    \ Mobile Sink and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nA different paradigm for the\
    \ traditional setup of data gathering in WSN, which\nrelies on a single or multiple\
    \ static sink(s) towards which all trafﬁc needs to travel, is\nthe utilization\
    \ of one or multiple mobile sinks (MSs) that traverse the terrain and collect\n\
    the reports from the devices. Such mobile sink(s) can be the trafﬁc’s ﬁnal destination\
    \ or\njust an accessory that collects the data and transmits it to the sink. Note\
    \ that in the latter\ncase, the ﬁnal destination is not necessarily located within\
    \ the wireless network realm\nand can be located outside it (e.g., within the\
    \ Internet or the cloud). Since these mobile\nsinks are unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ in many cases, these systems are sometimes called\nunmanned aerial vehicle-wireless\
    \ sensor networks (UAV–WSNs). This section reviews\nseveral state-of-the-art developments\
    \ in mobile sink(s). Since sometimes the MS routing\nchallenges are interleaved\
    \ with the MAC layer’s challenges, the solution suggested in some\npapers, and\
    \ accordingly their description, incorporated both layers.\nTypically, data-gathering\
    \ protocols that utilize moving sink(s) aim at optimizing some\nperformance metrics,\
    \ such as overall power consumption, average or worst latency of the\ndata, trajectory\
    \ traversed by the mobile sink, awake time of the sensors, maximizing the\nlife\
    \ cycle of the network, and so on. There are different options to classify these\
    \ protocols:\nthey can be classiﬁed according to this aforementioned performance\
    \ objective, or other\ncategories, such as characteristics of the moving sink,\
    \ its speed and constraints, network\nmodel, communication standard utilized,\
    \ and so on. In this section, we will classify the\nprotocol into two classes:\
    \ protocols that solely rely on the moving sink with no intra-trafﬁc\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n27 of 44\nbetween the nodes (all the trafﬁc is directly transmitted\
    \ to the moving sink), and protocols\nthat combine routing between the nodes and\
    \ trafﬁc forwarding to the sink. This latter\nclass will mostly include cluster-based\
    \ protocols in which the nodes are clustered and\ncluster-heads (CHs) are selected,\
    \ but rather than the CHs routing the trafﬁc towards the\nsink, they forward the\
    \ trafﬁc directly to the mobile sink.\n5.4.1. Routing Directly to the Mobile Sink(s)\
    \ with No Intra-Node Data Forwarding\nIn this section, we review papers in which\
    \ the only data trafﬁc is between the nodes\nand the mobile sink, and no data\
    \ is forwarded between the nodes.\nZhan et al. [179] consider a general fading\
    \ channel model and suggest an efﬁcient\nsub-optimal solution that minimizes the\
    \ energy consumption of all sensor nodes (SNs)\nwhile ensuring that data is collected\
    \ reliably from all SNs with bounded outage probability.\nThe suggested solution\
    \ decouples the joint optimization problem, which considers both\nthe SNs’ wake-up\
    \ schedule and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV’s) trajectory, into two\nseparate\
    \ optimization problems, ensuring that the amount of data collected from each\
    \ SN\nreliably exceeds a threshold. One of the formulated optimization problems\
    \ is non-convex\ndue to non-convex constraints, and therefore it needs to be relaxed.\
    \ The two problems are\nsolved iteratively to obtain an approximate solution.\
    \ A ﬂight time minimization problem\nfor a UAV that collects data from a set of\
    \ energy-constrained ground sensors is studied by\nGong et al. [180]. The sensors\
    \ are assumed to be located on a line (one dimension). Each\nsensor has a certain\
    \ amount of data to upload. The UAV can collect data either while\nﬂying or while\
    \ hovering, and only from a single sensor at a time. Accordingly, the UAV’s\n\
    trajectory is divided into non-overlapping data collection intervals, each dedicated\
    \ to\ncollecting data from a single sensor. The objective is to minimize the total\
    \ ﬂight time of the\nUAV from an initial point to a destination by jointly optimizing\
    \ the division of intervals, the\nUAV’s speed, as well as the sensors’ transmission\
    \ power. The ﬂight time minimization is\nformulated as a dynamic programming (DP)\
    \ problem, where each DP stage considers ﬂight\ntime minimization for a single-sensor\
    \ data collection scenario. The algorithm for the single-\nsensor case is used\
    \ to ﬁnd the UAV’s optimal speed and the sensor’s transmission power.\nIt is shown\
    \ that the UAV’s optimal speed is proportional to the given energy of the sensors\n\
    and the inter-sensor distance but is inversely proportional to the data upload\
    \ requirements.\nThe metric addressed by Liu et al. [181] is the age of the information.\
    \ In particular,\nRef. [181] utilizes UAV, and suggests two age-optimal trajectories\
    \ for it to collect the\ndata from the ground SNs, one that minimizes the age\
    \ of the ‘oldest’ sensed information\namong the sensors, and another that minimizes\
    \ the average age of the information sensed\nby all sensors. It is shown that\
    \ both age-optimal trajectories correspond to the shortest\nHamiltonian path in\
    \ the wireless sensor network, in which the distance between any\ntwo sensors\
    \ is represented by the amount of inter-visit time. The authors adopt dynamic\n\
    programming and genetic algorithm to ﬁnd the two different age-optimal trajectories.\n\
    Liu et al. [182] also utilize a UAV to collect the data from the ground sensors.\
    \ The model\nsuggested therein assumes that the sensors (nodes) are randomly distributed\
    \ over a square\narea. The area is partitioned into small square cells. The UAV\
    \ ﬂying above the cells\nhovers above each cell to collect all the data of the\
    \ sensors within the cell. The paper\nstudies the amount of data per unit time\
    \ that the UAV can collect from the ground nodes\nas a function of the number\
    \ of cells, the height of the UAV, the number of sensors, and\nthe energy capacity\
    \ of the UAV. The paper suggests a similar analysis when multiple\nUAVs are utilized.\
    \ It seeks the optimal number of cells to maximize the per-node capacity\nunder\
    \ the suggested model and shows that under the suggested data collection network,\n\
    multiple UAVs can signiﬁcantly improve the per-node capacity attained by a single\
    \ UAV.\nThe balanced network communication protocol (BNCP) that utilizes UAV as\
    \ a mobile\nsink is suggested by Qin et al. [183]. There is no inter-sensor routing\
    \ in BNCP, and all\nsensors’ communication energy is spent on the sensor-UAV transmission\
    \ links. BNCP is\nimplemented and evaluated.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n28 of 44\n\
    5.4.2. Cluster-Based Data Forwarding\nRather than the mobile sink node traversing\
    \ the network between all the sensors, a\ndifferent approach groups the sensors\
    \ into clusters and selects cluster-heads (CH), which\ncollect the data from all\
    \ cluster members, thus decreasing the traverse of the mobile sink.\nIn general,\
    \ data gathering in a clustered WSN imposes a tradeoff between the energy\nconsumed\
    \ during data collection within each cluster and the energy consumed by the\n\
    mobile sink. On the one hand, the higher the number of clusters (smaller clusters),\
    \ the\nless energy is consumed during data collection by the cluster-heads (CH);\
    \ on the other\nhand, it follows that the UAV will have to access more CHs on\
    \ its route, and consequently,\nthe energy spent by the UAV will be higher in\
    \ that case. This trade-off is one of the main\nchallenges in addressing the joint\
    \ problem of clusterization and CH selection, jointly with\nﬁnding the path traversed\
    \ by the UAV, as reﬂected in several papers discussed below.\nNajjar-Ghabel et\
    \ al. [184] propose a two-phase algorithm, termed DGOB, for data\ngathering in\
    \ WSNs in an environment impaired by obstacles, which utilizes a mobile sink\n\
    that traverses the network and collects the data. Both phases, node clusterization\
    \ and\nMS trajectory construction, exploit artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) schemes.\
    \ Tazibt et al. [185]\nutilize a small-scale drone to gather the data from scattered\
    \ sensors. Like in several other\npapers that rely on UAV to collect data from\
    \ cluster-heads, the challenge in [185] is two-fold:\n(i) clusterization and CH\
    \ selection (in contrast with other papers, this paper allows multi-\nhop clusters,\
    \ such that cluster members are up to a predeﬁned number of hops from their\n\
    CH); and (ii) plan of the drone trajectory for traversing through all CHs with\
    \ minimum\nenergy consumption (e.g., minimum path length). Even though the two\
    \ problems are\nrelated, the authors solve the two issues sequentially. They ﬁrst\
    \ solve the CH selection\nby formulating an optimization problem that seeks the\
    \ minimal set of cluster-heads that\nguarantee that all nodes are at most h hops\
    \ from a CH in the set. After determining the CH\nset via linear programing, they\
    \ utilize the 2-opt heuristic, which relies on a simple local\nsearch algorithm\
    \ for solving the traveling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the optimal\ntravel\
    \ trajectory for the drone between the selected CHs.\nKumar and Dash [186] also\
    \ suggest a data-gathering-by-mobile-sink scheme in WSN.\nThe model in [186] assumes\
    \ that the mobile sink is moving along a pre-speciﬁed path with\nconstant speed\
    \ and can collect data while traveling. The paper denotes all the sensors\nthat\
    \ are in transmission range from the mobile-sink traversed path, and can therefore\n\
    relay trafﬁc to it, as sub-sinks. All other nodes need to forward their data to\
    \ these sub-\nsinks, possibly through multi-hop communication, in order for them\
    \ to relay the data\nto the mobile sink. The paper suggests two different models:\
    \ the ﬁrst assumes that the\nmobile sink can receive data from only one sensor\
    \ at a time, while the second assumes that\nthe mobile sink can receive data from\
    \ multiple sensors simultaneously. Both suggested\nalgorithms comprise three phases:\
    \ (i) identify the relay nodes (sub-sinks) that are within\ntransmission range\
    \ from the mobile sink trajectory (unit disk graph model), and partition\nthe\
    \ path into segments that are the union of all the transmission disks of all the\
    \ sub-sinks;\n(ii) determine the communication time each sub-sink can have with\
    \ the mobile sink, and\naccordingly, the amount of data it can transmit; (iii)\
    \ utilize a network ﬂow approach to\ndetermine which sub-sink transmits to the\
    \ mobile sink in each of the mobile sink’s path\nsegments. Ebrahimi et al. [187]\
    \ aim to optimize total transmission power between WSN\ncluster-heads in an IoT\
    \ network. The problem is split into subproblems, which include\nCH assignment,\
    \ building of the forwarding tree within each cluster, and optimal UAV\ntrajectory\
    \ calculation. The data transmitted by CH to UAV is pre-processed by a specialized\n\
    optimized compression. A genetic algorithm for energy-efﬁcient CH selection is\
    \ employed\nby Wu et al. [188].\nThe focus of Zahra et al. [189] is on MS that\
    \ traverses a WSN that relies on a cluster-\nbased data collection protocol in\
    \ which cluster-heads are responsible for collecting and\ntransmitting the cluster\
    \ members’ sensed data to the MS. The paper examines a scenario in\nwhich the\
    \ MS is constantly moving in a predeﬁned trajectory, regardless of whether the\n\
    data transfer was completed or not. Accordingly, when the cluster aggregate data\
    \ is too\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n29 of 44\nlarge, the CH cannot complete the\
    \ transaction. The authors suggest a mechanism in which,\nin case the CH cannot\
    \ complete the transaction, it can use different cluster members as\nrelays to\
    \ continue the transaction after the MS has moved out of the transmission range\n\
    of the CH. Likewise, Zhang et al. [190] also suggest a hybrid approach that combines\
    \ the\nMS with hierarchical routing-based protocol relying on node clusterization.\
    \ In order to\nimprove the efﬁciency of the MS data collection, Ref. [190] suggests\
    \ utilizing virtual heads\n(VHs) that lie on the MS trajectory on the cluster\
    \ boundaries that also transmit collected\ndata to the MS. The channel access\
    \ relies on a random access mechanism.\nThe UAV can be of different physical structures.\
    \ While some machines are able to slow\ndown and even to hover, others, especially\
    \ the winged UAVs, can only ﬂy with a constant\nvelocity. This limitation poses\
    \ an additional challenge; see Say et al. [191] for a possible\nsolution. To address\
    \ the velocity limitation, the grid topology of the UAV’s coverage is\ndivided\
    \ into frames, and the most distant frames get the highest priority. The priority-based\n\
    transmissions from sensors to the moving UAV are incorporated into a MAC layer,\
    \ by\nintroducing a priority-based contention window adjustment scheme. A smaller\
    \ contention\nwindow is assigned to the frame where sensors send packets from\
    \ the rear side of the UAV,\nand should therefore have a higher transmission priority.\
    \ This results in a low packet loss\nwhen the UAV ﬂies forward. On top of this\
    \ architecture, a frame-selection-based routing\nprotocol is formulated.\n6. Wearables\
    \ and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN)\nNumerous applications rely on data gathering\
    \ and report collection in WSN and IoT,\nand some are mentioned throughout the\
    \ paper. There is no doubt that the essence of WSN\nis the applications that utilize\
    \ the infrastructure discussed throughout this paper. Providing\na thorough review\
    \ of such applications can encompass several surveys. Since wearables\nare becoming\
    \ highly popular and a ubiquitous application which imposes new challenges\nin\
    \ the context of data gathering, we discuss several recent results and related\
    \ challenges in\nthe context of wearables. Figure 5 depicts the main topics discussed\
    \ in this section.\nWearables and WBAN\nSection 6\nEnergy Harvesting (EH)\nSection\
    \ 6.1\nTechnological Advances\nSection 6.2\nTransmission Protocols\nSection 6.3\n\
    WBAN Applications\nSection 6.4\nFigure 5. The main topics in the context of wearables\
    \ covered in the section, and a rough partition of\nthe papers covered by these\
    \ topics.\nWearable technology refers to smart devices attached to the human body\
    \ or apparel\nto monitor the user and their environment. Wearables are designed\
    \ to detect, analyze,\nand transmit information, which allows continuous monitoring\
    \ of the subject. In some\ncases (e.g., healthcare applications), feedback is\
    \ returned to the wearer with strict perfor-\nmance constraints (e.g., reliability,\
    \ latency bounds). Such applications can necessitate the\nmonitoring of both bodily\
    \ conditions, such as blood pressure, blood glucose level (e.g.,\nin conjunction\
    \ with an insulin pump), ECG, EMG, body temperature, accelerometer, and\ngyroscope,\
    \ as well as environmental conditions that might inﬂuence the user, such as\n\
    temperature, humidity, CO2 level, dust level, and location.\nSensing essential\
    \ human physiological parameters led to the innovation of wireless\nbody area\
    \ networks (WBANs). WBAN typically relates to a small area network that spans\n\
    the whole human body. It comprises devices (wearables) located in the apparel,\
    \ on the\nbody, or under the skin, and are wirelessly connected. Even though tracking\
    \ physical\nconditions applies to diverse domains, including medical, social,\
    \ and economic ones, each\nwith its particular implications and extensive research\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the speciﬁc challenges\nof acquiring data in WBANs necessitated\
    \ new solutions designed for WBAN. Speciﬁcally,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n30 of\
    \ 44\nsince the sensors in WBANS are designed to be located close to the monitored\
    \ individual,\nthey impose particular challenges related to their speciﬁc structural,\
    \ functional, and size-\nrelated constraints. In the sequel, we dwell on some\
    \ of the most critical challenges and\nrecent promising results on WBANS. The\
    \ main objective of this survey is to understand the\ndata-gathering challenges.\
    \ In the special case of WBANS, we also elaborate on the sensors’\nphysical and\
    \ mechanical structure, which directly impact the data acquisition process.\n\
    Many of the challenges pertaining to WSN in general, which are described throughout\n\
    this survey, also apply to wearables. However, some of these challenges are exaggerated\n\
    when applied to wearables due to their unique characteristics. For example, energy-related\n\
    challenges that are essential to address and substantially inﬂuence any WSN design\
    \ and\nperformance, open a different perspective on wearables. Speciﬁcally, due\
    \ to their sensing\ndevices’ tiny size, the energy storing capacities are limited.\
    \ Yet, many wearable applications,\nparticularly healthcare ones, employ continuous\
    \ sampling and communication tasks that\nconstantly consume energy and deplete\
    \ the device’s battery. Frequent battery replacement,\nwhich can be a burden in\
    \ any WSN, can be even more cumbersome in wearables and can\nhinder the adoption\
    \ of these technologies (e.g., when the wearables are implants, battery\nreplacement\
    \ can involve an invasive medical intervention). Accordingly, energy-efﬁcient\n\
    approaches designed for wearable sensor networks are important for disseminating\
    \ the\ntechnology into additional domains. An inclusive review of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ approaches\ndesigned for human context recognition (HCR) based on wearable sensor\
    \ networks is\ngiven by [192]. This paper classiﬁes energy-efﬁcient mechanisms\
    \ for health-related HCR\napplications, based on the task that the mechanism is\
    \ aimed at to reduce its energy con-\nsumption (e.g., sensing, communication,\
    \ computation). The paper reviews the related\nworks according to the classiﬁcation.\n\
    6.1. Energy Harvesting (EH)\nEnergy harvesting as a battery alternative has been\
    \ discussed in Section 5.2. However,\nEH in the context of wearables encounters\
    \ new challenges, such as critical reliability level,\nexpected tiny size and\
    \ position in/on the human body, limited exposure to energy sources\nsuch as solar\
    \ energy, and so on. Accordingly, we revisit EH and review some EH studies\nin\
    \ the context of wearables. The three most prominent techniques include photovoltaic\n\
    cells attached to a wearable (energy is accumulated from environmental illumination),\n\
    thermoelectric nanogenerators (the energy source is the heat produced by the human\
    \ body),\nand kinetic energy harvesters (energy is created by natural body motion).\
    \ All energy\nharvesting cases pose a fundamental challenge of effective energy\
    \ management, which\ninvolves continuous decision making regarding how much energy\
    \ to spend on sensing,\nmeasurements, on-board classiﬁcation, and transmission\
    \ (see also Section 5.2).\nWe present examples for each of the techniques mentioned\
    \ above in the context\nof wearables. Thermoelectric energy-harvesting units exploiting\
    \ self-generated human\nheat are suggested to be fabricated straight into the\
    \ textile of the garments [193]. Energy\nharvesting for activity-aware wearables\
    \ is designed by Khalifa et al. [194]. The idea is to\nremove the accelerometers,\
    \ which consume about 80% of the battery. Instead, the authors\npropose to employ\
    \ kinetic energy harvesters, which will convert human motion into\nelectrical\
    \ power. Additionally, to compensate for the accelerometers’ removal, the input\
    \ and\noutput of the kinetic energy harvester would be analyzed by a specialized\
    \ activity classiﬁer\nto track and identify the human activity (i.e., to perform\
    \ the primary task of the wearable).\nLight-based energy-harvesting wearables\
    \ are discussed by Park et al. [195]. It is noteworthy\nthat as the available\
    \ luminosity can be highly unpredictable, the overall functioning, data-\ngathering,\
    \ and transmission process would imply an optimization problem. Henceforth,\n\
    the same authors suggest a protocol to optimize the number and accuracy of interpretation\n\
    of human gestures by an energy-harvesting wearable device under an energy budget,\n\
    Park et al. [196]. To this end, they constructed an analytical model that characterizes\n\
    energy consumption based on experimental data and formulized the optimization\
    \ problem.\nEsteves et al. [197] suggest incorporating energy harvesting as part\
    \ of MAC 802.15.6. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n31 of 44\nproposed MAC modiﬁcation\
    \ includes the usage of some body sensors as relays. The\nmanaging part at a hub\
    \ (e.g., a smartphone) sets the optimal relay charging times to\nperform the data\
    \ transmission by relay effectively. A source and the relays send their\nenergy-harvesting\
    \ updates within the request for cooperation (RFC) packets. The charging\ntimes\
    \ are calculated according to the amount of energy at the source and relays and\
    \ are\nupdated in accordance with previous packet transmission success or failure.\n\
    6.2. Technological Advances\nWBAN utilization is penetrating new domains, spanning\
    \ a wide variety of sensors,\neach providing a different aspect of the monitored\
    \ subject. For example, healthcare ap-\nplications are expected to provide a wide\
    \ span of indicators from various physiological\nparameters. Speciﬁcally, to provide\
    \ a comprehensive status of the examinee, it requires, in\naddition to the standard\
    \ indicators such as heart rate and physical activity that many of us\nalready\
    \ have integrated in our watch, information at a deeper level and molecular level\n\
    insight into the dynamics of the wearer.\nTo cope with the growing popularity\
    \ of wearables and their expansion to a broader\nscope of applications, especially\
    \ in healthcare systems, with the increasing demand to\nimprove quality of service\
    \ (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE), a new generation of\nwearables has emerged.\
    \ This generation relies on several technological advances in both\nthe device\
    \ and cloud realms. The novel device technology utilizes new soft-sensing tech-\n\
    nologies, including innovative wearable materials such as conducting polymers,\
    \ rigid\nforms of hydrogel, gold and silver nanowires (to create nanowired tattoos\
    \ as stretchable\nsensors), carbon nanotubes, liquid metals, ionic liquids, and\
    \ others. These materials give\nrise to novel sensor families, such as electro-physiological\
    \ (acting on the electric potential\ndifference) physical and chemical sensors.\
    \ See the latest advances in the following related\nworks [198–200]. For example,\
    \ besides reviewing the key developments in sweat-sensing\ntechnology, Bariya\
    \ et al. [198] examine the requirements of the underlying components\nembedded\
    \ in sweat-based wearable sensors and discuss challenges for integrating wearable\n\
    sweat sensors in the development of personalized healthcare. Sweat-sensing technology\n\
    has been described earlier; see, for example, Salvo et al. [201], where a device\
    \ containing\ntwo humidity sensors located at different heights from the skin\
    \ is designed in a way that\nallows one to measure the sweat rate by the difference\
    \ in readings of these two sensing\nsub-units. Thermal comfort control by calculating\
    \ the relation between the vapor pres-\nsure and the temperature is designed into\
    \ watch-type sweat sensors by Sim et al. [202].\nSweat measurement by sweat biomarkers\
    \ (in particular, pH and Na+) is implemented\nby Song et al. [203]. In short,\
    \ the biomarkers cause a change in electric potential near the\nmeasuring device,\
    \ allowing for accurate sweat measurement during physical activity. The\nauthors\
    \ also note that the change in electrical potential allows for energy harvesting,\
    \ which\ncan be effectively managed to self-power the device and thus allow for\
    \ a battery-free design.\nIn general, the material imprinted into the working\
    \ reacting electrode determines which\nsubstance (i.e., a chemical component present\
    \ in the sweat) it will react with. For example,\nan application of electrochemical\
    \ differential pulse voltammetry to sense the sweat to\nmeasure the level of caffeine\
    \ is devised by Tai et al. [204].\nThe main challenge in the devices is to implement\
    \ capabilities of effective data gath-\nering, ﬁltering, and transmission within\
    \ microscopic computing units. Some biometric\nsensing (especially made by speciﬁc\
    \ conﬁgurations of adjacent sensor sets) produces large\namounts of data (as in\
    \ ECG sensing) that should undergo an appropriate local density\nreduction. To\
    \ ensure conformity with the sensing devices, paper lithium batteries are\nproposed\
    \ (see, e.g., [205]). In addition, many sensors are conﬁgured only to transmit\n\
    following special hazards. For example, ECG sensors should trigger an alarm in\
    \ case the\nheartbeat is abnormal. This local data processing is a preliminary\
    \ phase that facilitates\nthe more intensive data analyses in the intermediate\
    \ data collection unit (the smartphone),\nand ﬁnally, the destination server.\
    \ To treat noisiness and variability (if the sensor sampling\nfrequency is too\
    \ high) of raw data from an accelerometer or gyroscope or loss of data (if the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n32 of 44\nsensor sampling frequency is too low), variable\
    \ sampling is proposed by Li et al. [206]. The\nofﬂine ML classiﬁcation algorithm\
    \ is used to identify and predict the physical activity.\nThe recent development\
    \ of miniature sensors combined with minimization of battery\nsize and energy\
    \ harvesting advances is sometimes referred to as a new paradigm, known as\nWearables\
    \ 2. For example, Ling et al. [207] provide a detailed description of various\
    \ types\nof sensors, means of attaching them to the human body, multiple parameters\
    \ the sensors\nare capable of measuring, and techniques to communicate and process\
    \ the measured data.\n6.3. Transmission Protocols\nWe note that while many of\
    \ the works mentioned above employ a smartphone device\nwith an application that\
    \ is presumably tailored to receive data from the wearables, having\na dedicated\
    \ hardware device that would ofﬂoad some of the networking burden (e.g.,\npotential\
    \ simpliﬁcation of the packetizing process) of the sensors would be more effective\n\
    and reliable. Indeed, in Pathak et al. [208], a central processing hub allows\
    \ one to circumvent\nthe cumbersome processes of sensor identiﬁcation, sensor\
    \ joining, and reconﬁguration\nby providing a designated interface. The authors\
    \ provide real hardware implementation,\nexplore various performance metrics,\
    \ and provide energy measurements.\nSeveral available protocols for data transmission\
    \ are suitable for WBAN. We mention\nhere the low Bluetooth energy (BLE; see,\
    \ e.g., Townsend et al. [209] for a detailed protocol\nstack description and Gomez\
    \ et al. [210] for performance evaluation and comparison with\nordinary Bluetooth\
    \ and other protocols). For distances of several centimeters, near-ﬁeld\ncommunication\
    \ (NFC) protocol (see Coskun et al. [211] for the theory and Kim et al. [212]\n\
    for a description of possible device designs and applications). Details of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.6\nstandard, which covers WBAN, can be found in, for example, Kwak\
    \ et al. [213]. One sees\ntherein how the human body communications PHY layer\
    \ in particular is deﬁned.\n6.4. WBAN Applications\nEven though, as stated earlier,\
    \ there is no intention to provide a thorough review of\nWBAN applications, we\
    \ mention several interesting ones. Monitoring of workers involved\nin extreme\
    \ conditions or whose activity can be potentially dangerous (e.g., Lee et al.\
    \ [214])\nsuggest wearable sensors for monitoring miners or construction professionals.\
    \ This study\nevaluates integrated wearable sensors for measuring construction\
    \ workers’ personal level\nof workload, individual factors, and physiological\
    \ reactions during rooﬁng activities. A\nfatigue detection system for car drivers\
    \ by Chang et al. [215] includes smart glasses, which\nare able to identify possible\
    \ drowsiness by an IR detector aimed at the driver’s eyes,\nequipped with BLE\
    \ transmitter. A small processor embedded into the glasses gathers and\npre-analyzes\
    \ the data and then transmits them to the on-board computer in the car. The\n\
    latter makes a decision about whether to issue a fatigue warning and sends it\
    \ to the cloud.\nWearables can be attached to a human body in order to sense the\
    \ environment for the safety\nof the carrier, as in Wu et al. [216]. The data\
    \ (humidity and temperature) is then transmitted\nto a mobile unit, where it can\
    \ be analyzed locally or further transmitted to the cloud in order\nto issue timely\
    \ warnings. Classiﬁcation of sports activity is implemented and validated by\n\
    experiments by Qi et al. [217], where the activity is identiﬁed from accelerometer\
    \ and ECG\nmeasurements done by chest and wrist sensors. The measurements are\
    \ transmitted to a\nsmartphone, which performs the data processing. SVM is employed\
    \ for the classiﬁcation.\nYou et al. [218] suggest a real-time wireless body sensor\
    \ networks (WBSNs) scheme\nfor welfare assessment and disease monitoring, prevention,\
    \ and treatment. The suggested\nscheme is composed of three components: sensing,\
    \ communication, and management.\nSensing attains a set of physiological parameters,\
    \ such as heart rate, body temperature,\nECG, temperature, blood pressure, blood\
    \ glucose, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, from\ndesignated sensors embedded\
    \ on a smart shirt worn by the monitored user. Communi-\ncation handles the processes\
    \ of delivering the sensed physiological data and controlling\ninstructions to\
    \ a backend server through wireless networks. The transmission protocols\ncan\
    \ be divided into two segments: the transfer of information from the sensors to\
    \ a central\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n33 of 44\nterminal located at a smartphone\
    \ and the transfer of information between the smartphone\nand the designated server,\
    \ which is located on the healthcare cloud. The communication\nrelies on multiple\
    \ communication protocols including Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G/4G (which\ncan be\
    \ replaced by 5G where available). Management is responsible for collecting, classify-\n\
    ing, and monitoring the physiological data, and furthermore, being able to issue\
    \ warning\nmessages to medical professionals or caregivers whenever the physiological\
    \ data are ab-\nnormal. Additional applications utilizing data gathering can be\
    \ found in the following\nsurvey [219].\nWe conclude by emphasizing that the beneﬁts\
    \ of WBANs have not run their course\nyet. The development of data gathering will\
    \ jointly progress with the ongoing advances\nin sensor construction and manufacturing\
    \ capability, development, and standardization\nof Wearables 2 and beyond. Development\
    \ of specialized post-processing platforms poses\na specialized challenge, and\
    \ the urge to make progress in this area is acute. To illustrate\nthis, on account\
    \ of an ever-growing population, specialized platforms for elderly care\nare needed;\
    \ see, for example, the recent papers [220,221] about wearables designated for\n\
    elderly patients and references therein.\nFinally, wearables have been recently\
    \ harnessed for combating the COVID-19 disease.\nEarly identiﬁcation of COVID-19\
    \ symptoms by evaluating the resting heart rate during the\nasymptomatic (presumably\
    \ infectious) period and analysis by a deep learning framework\nis evaluated by\
    \ Bogu and Snyder [222]. While the precision of such a tool is clearly inferior\n\
    to the standard medical assays, it may be useful to provide a preliminary alert\
    \ for the\nearly onset of the disease for people in risk groups. Hassantabar et\
    \ al. [223] suggest a\nframework termed CovidDeep that combines commercially available\
    \ wearable physiolog-\nical feature sensors (WMSs) and a simple yes/no questionnaire\
    \ with efﬁcient DNNs for\npervasive large-scale monitoring of disease onset and\
    \ health condition. The automatically\nextracted raw data and medical background\
    \ and symptom responses are combined with\nsynthetically generated data to train\
    \ the DNN architecture. Grow-and-prune synthesis is\nused to generate accurate\
    \ and computationally efﬁcient models that can be deployed for\nCOVID-19 inference.\n\
    Since viruses can spread between people who are in close contact with an infected\n\
    person, and since infected people may be asymptomatic, the pandemic taught us\
    \ that it\nis best to keep a safe distance from others (see, for example, Cortellessa\
    \ et al. [224] for\nclose-proximity risk assessment for COVID infection). Accordingly,\
    \ most health institutions\nrecommend keeping physical distance between people\
    \ in public places (commonly termed\nas ”social distancing”) in order to stop\
    \ the pandemic from spreading. Furthermore, people\nwho were in the proximity\
    \ of an infected person (tested positive for COVID) are encouraged\nto be examined,\
    \ and several governmental regulations even require such people to stay in\nquarantine.\
    \ Several recent studies have suggested leveraging wearables for contact tracing\n\
    in order to identify the hazard from close proximity. For example, Ng et al. [225]\
    \ focus on\nBluetooth low energy and discuss the different data ﬂow approaches\
    \ and the accuracy of\nsmartphone vs. smartwatch applications in proximity detection.\
    \ Bian et al. [226] utilize\nwearables to monitor social distancing as recommended\
    \ for preventing COVID-19 spread.\nIn particular, the authors design compact potentially\
    \ wearable oscillating-magnetic-ﬁeld-\nbased proximity-sensing prototype systems\
    \ suitable for the relevant safety distance and able\nto track social distancing\
    \ much more reliably than the current Bluetooth-based smartphone\ntechnology.\
    \ Shubina et al. [227] provide a brief technical overview of the main contact-\n\
    tracing approaches and the challenges they impose on wearable technology. The\
    \ paper\nalso provides a short overview of the existing solutions deployed for\
    \ contact tracing and a\ndiscussion on the potential effect of wearables in tackling\
    \ the spread of a highly contagious\nvirus. More works from the past year discuss\
    \ the use of wearables for remote management\nand automated assessment of COVID-19.\
    \ Amft et al. [228] provide an overview of insti-\ntutional initiatives and alternative,\
    \ more accurate technologies for detection of infection\nsymptoms and possible\
    \ contact with infected individuals. Channa et al. [229] is a system-\nSensors\

    \ sensors and their clinical utilization\nin screening and contact tracing.\n\
    7. Concluding Remarks\nData gathering in modern WSN and IoT networks encompasses\
    \ many challenges,\nwhich span the entire communication stack. Many techniques,\
    \ protocols, and solutions\nhave been proposed over the years, but as technology\
    \ advances, new challenges and new\nopportunities arise. In this survey, we reviewed\
    \ these main challenges and opportunities, as\nwell as recent advances, and related\
    \ them to speciﬁc data-gathering research domains. We\nprovided a comprehensive\
    \ state-of-the-art data-gathering literature review in modern WSN\nnetworks, distinguishing\
    \ between the communication layers and the research domain.\nWe ﬁrst summarized\
    \ general architectural novelties and emerging architectures. We\nreviewed several\
    \ new technological advances and their inﬂuence on sensing device design,\nthe\
    \ platform carrying it, and the transceiver. We reviewed the effect of these architectural\n\
    advantages on speciﬁc applications, such as agriculture, smart cities, smart homes.\
    \ We\nshowed how cloud computing drives new WSN types, which introduces new directions,\n\
    and discussed how WSN can coexist within social network domains. Compressed sensing\n\
    was summarized next. We provided an overview of this important scheme and reviewed\n\
    its utilization in WSNs. We proceeded with the MAC layer. Since the performance\
    \ of many\ninnovations in the higher layers rely on the underlay MAC protocol\
    \ and since many data\ngathering schemes utilize traditional WSN MAC protocols,\
    \ we provided an overview of\nthese traditional protocols and mentioned state-of-the-art\
    \ works in WSN and IoT. These\nworks devise new MAC approaches for data gathering.\
    \ Next, we covered the recent\nadvances in routing. Similarly, we opened with\
    \ an overview of the traditional routing\nprotocols utilized for data-gathering\
    \ and reviewed several recent enhancements. We\nreviewed the utilization of network\
    \ coding for data gathering and explored the facilitation\nof UAV and mobile-sink\
    \ in collecting the data from the sensors. Lastly, we turned our\nattention to\
    \ the area of wearables which opens new research horizons for human health and\n\
    activity surveillance and discussed the new paradigm of Wireless Body Area Networks.\
    \ In\nthe spirit of the times, we concluded with several studies that utilize\
    \ some of the techniques\ndiscussed in this survey to aid in combating the COVID\
    \ pandemic.\nWhile we provided the general background to the research areas we\
    \ covered, we\nmainly focused on cutting-edge research works. Yet we note that\
    \ even seemingly exhausted\ntopics, such as MAC and Routing protocols, provide\
    \ new technological developments and\npresent opportunities for new research domains.\n\
    As implied throughout this survey, there are several research areas that attract\
    \ a\nlot of attention and anticipation for future developments. For example, technological\n\
    innovations in manufacturing more compact sensing units with yet superior transmission,\n\
    reception and processing capabilities are extremely in demand in several disciplines\
    \ which\ninclude wearables, smart homes, IoT-related domains and others. All the\
    \ more so, this\nis relevant when dealing with healthcare applications and implants.\
    \ Such technological\ninnovations will require in turn enhancements to other domains\
    \ across the communication\nstack in order to adjust to the new opportunities\
    \ and limitations. Energy acquisition is\nstill a fruitful research domain. In\
    \ this respect, ﬁnding new sources of energy harvesting\n(EH), better utilization\
    \ of existing energy resources and energy storage are still challenging\nresearch\
    \ ﬁelds. Similarly, new EH methods impose multiple new challenges on the entire\n\
    protocol stack, which are correlated with the EH method, e.g., different EH methods\
    \ dictate\nconstraints on the MAC design, which in turn, impact the routing protocol\
    \ which affects\nthe performance end eventually the application utilizing the\
    \ infrastructure. The growth of\nsuch networks supporting a variety of heterogeneous\
    \ devices of communication standards\nand their increasing density requires more\
    \ effective data compression techniques and\nefﬁcient on-grid data analyses (i.e.,\
    \ even prior to data delivery to sinks). On the off-grid\nside of WSNs, we note\
    \ that consistent progress in Cloud Computing (CC) technology and\nexploitation\
    \ methodology will open new horizons in data analysis.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    35 of 44\nDeployment of Edge Computing units cooperating with sensing-capable\
    \ units will\nimply the development of novel data-gathering schemes. As WSN density\
    \ increases,\nchallenges in the gathering of useful data by WSN and its consequent\
    \ analysis will coincide\nwith those of Big Data. Clearly, the processes of such\
    \ analyses should be implemented\nwithin Cloud Computing systems. The fashion\
    \ of the CC physical resources deployed in\norder to efﬁciently interact with\
    \ WSN is not necessarily similar to those of usual IT-to-CC\nconnectivity. It\
    \ is not currently properly standardized and, most importantly, it is not\nclear\
    \ how correctly CC (e.g., which HW, correct deployment of Access Points) should\
    \ be\ncross-planned with a particular WSN. Issues of security and privacy which\
    \ are not covered\nin this survey will continue to elicit a major interest, especially\
    \ in keeping with evolving\nhealth care applications. The growth of the network\
    \ and their variability will require a\ngreater measure of adoption of ML and\
    \ AI methods and the development of such new\nspecialized methods for WSN in the\
    \ very near future.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nConﬂicts\

    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for performing
    a systematic literature review on the implementation of emerging business practices
    and the adoption of these key technologies: three-dimensional printing, artificial
    intelligence, blockchain, computing, digital applications, geospatial technologies,
    immersive environments, Internet of things, open and crowd-based platforms, proximity
    technologies, and robotics. Through the content analysis of the full text of scientific
    papers, emerging practices are captured and then classified within a group of
    standardized labels. This allows to summarize an emerging practice as the use
    of a key technology within a business context—represented by industry, business
    function, and business process adopting the technology—with the aim of achieving
    improvements in terms of business performance. The adoption of this methodology
    allows the recognition of the opportunities for companies of enhancing performance
    through key technologies. With this study, the framework is tested by classifying
    more than 22 000 scientific articles and extracting 15 708 emerging practices.
    The explicative power of data collected is demonstrated by performing an explorative
    analysis aiming at illustrating the state-of-the-art of emerging practices. Moreover,
    by employing association rules algorithms, 262 practices are found as the most
    frequent and relevant and are the candidate for becoming future best practices.

    The fourth industrial revolution, also referred to as Industry 4.0, focused the
    attention of policymakers, researchers, practitioners, industry analysts, and
    managers on the employment of key technologies to support future investments,
    consumption, growth, employment, and trade [1], [2]. Despite the initial reference
    to the manufacturing industry and the concept of smart factory [3], [4], the implications
    of Industry 4.0 also regard other sectors where technologies can be a driver of
    business performance improvement [5], [6], [7]. Within the industry 4.0 paradigm,
    the appropriate implementation of key technologies is fundamental to achieve positive
    outcomes [8]. Such technologies can be considered as either “new” since they are
    featured by radical novelty, with promising but uncertain impacts [1] or “cutting
    edge” because they employ the most current and high-level developments. Therefore,
    companies can rely on these technologies to carry out new emerging business practices,
    which depart from traditional and current best practices, in order to achieve
    significant competitive advantage. However, since the improvements of business
    performance determined by the adoption of emerging practices are unproven and
    not easily repeatable, companies investing in such technologies have to accept
    the risks of failure [9]. Thus, many companies are reluctant to change since emerging
    practices only promise to solve business problems [10]. Indeed, they prefer to
    use standard or best practices employing consolidated technologies that have proven
    a positive impact on the business, with a limited risk. Scientific literature
    supports companies, providing examples of application, even though the scientific
    debate is often oriented on technical challenges rather than the organizational
    ones [11], [12], [13]. For instance, the literature on blockchain has particularly
    stressed technical issues, but its real impact on the business is still questionable
    and under investigation [13], [14]. Anyway, the literature anticipates emerging
    trends in technology management [15] and provides significant suggestions to companies.
    Because of the wide number of scientific papers facing the issues of emerging
    practices, the research is fragmented in thousands of contributions, and it is
    difficult to understand the current state-of-the-art. The purpose of this work
    is to present a framework for performing a systematic literature review on the
    state-of-the-art of emerging practices so that researchers can monitor the advancements
    in terms of implementation of key technologies, and companies can understand which
    applications have been sufficiently tested and can be considered worthy of consideration.
    Such a framework supports the building of a repository of emerging practices employing
    key technologies based on the standardization of the emerging practices captured
    by content analysis of scientific papers’ full texts. Indeed, scientific literature
    anticipates future business implementations so that, by examining the repository,
    it is possible to forecast the future role of technologies [15], [16]. Each emerging
    practice is summarized as the adoption of a key technology within a specific business
    context, with implications in terms of enhancement of the business performance.
    It is important to define the business impact because companies can have a clear
    understanding of the potential effects that will derive from the implementation
    of key technology. This reduces the uncertainty and the risks associated with
    the adoption of emerging practices since the positive effects on business performance
    can be evaluated on real case studies and projects from which the practice is
    extracted. At the end of July 2022, more than 22 000 scientific papers published
    from 2019 to 2022 were studied and 15 708 practices recorded within the repository.
    Data within the repository were recorded by a team of researchers in the field
    of organization, engineering, and technology management. In particular, by following
    an inductive approach [17], [18], 11 categories of key technologies are defined:
    3-D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, computing, digital applications,
    geospatial technologies, immersive environments, Internet of Things (IoT), open
    and crowd-based platforms, proximity technologies, and robotics. In the literature,
    no other literature review covers such a large set of key technologies and no
    study based on thousands of scientific papers was found. Consequently, in addition
    to practical and managerial usefulness of the framework, from the analysis of
    the repository, many interesting insights emerge for scholars. Each emerging practice
    has different opportunities of implementation and peculiarities in terms of impacts
    on business performance, industry, business function, and business process where
    it can be carried out. To show the explicative power of the framework, this article
    will present an explorative analysis of the repository in order to answer the
    following research question. Which are the most frequent and relevant emerging
    practices that could become future best practices? Indeed, emerging practices
    are analyzed by implementing association rule mining techniques in order to understand
    for each key technology, which are the emerging practices that are likely to become
    the future best practices, since they are both most frequently proposed in case
    studies and with higher rates of stability in terms of the type of impact on the
    business performance that are able to achieve. The rest of this article is organized
    as follows. An overview is presented of the concepts of key technologies and emerging
    practices to underscore the usefulness of detecting novel trends for achieving
    competitive advantage and the classification of key technologies to put in evidence
    the limitations of current literature. Indeed, with this work, 87 key technologies
    are considered, grouped in 11 macrocategories. Furthermore, the framework is presented.
    Indeed, to improve the quality of the systematic literature review, from the content
    analysis of scientific papers, a combination of the standardized variables and
    labels is determined so that it is possible to build a database of key technologies
    from scientific papers. Indeed, the analysis and interpretation of scientific
    papers was devoted to converting information into the standardized fields of the
    repository, as discussed in the section. These variables are linked to key technologies,
    business context, and impact on business performance. As to key technologies,
    a focus on the taxonomy of 11 key technologies, derived from a significant classification
    activity, is presented. Furthermore, the other variables—industry, business function,
    business process, and impacts—are introduced, and information about data collection
    from scientific papers is reported. Then, results of the analysis of the repository
    are described with a first descriptive analysis of each variable and a subsequent
    exploration of the most frequent and relevant combinations of variables that can
    be considered as the basis of potential future best practices for businesses.
    Such an analysis is performed by employing association rules techniques, which
    are machine learning algorithms that are able to find patterns and capture significant
    relationships among variables. Discussion will underscore theoretical contributions,
    methodological issues, and practical/managerial implications. Finally, conclusions
    will close the work. SECTION II. Theoretical Background A. Key Technologies and
    Business Practices According to the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR) model,
    a business practice is “a unique way to configure a process or a set of processes,”
    using particular technologies, skills, sequences, or methods. Three types of practices
    are widely acknowledged: standard, best, and emerging. Standard practices are
    the default practices that companies use to do business that do not provide any
    competitive advantage or significant cost saving and are associated with low risks
    and results [19]. Best practices are the best current repeatable and structured
    practices that have a proven positive impact on the business, with moderate risk
    and results [20]. Emerging practices employ new technologies or knowledge and
    differ in the way of organizing processes. Compared with best practices, they
    are unproven and not easily repeatable; therefore, they are associated with high
    risks [21]. However, if correctly and opportunely implemented, they could provide
    a particular competitive advantage. Therefore, when firms plan to implement emerging
    practices, they decide to accept the risk of failure, hoping to achieve a significant
    performance improvement [20]. Early adoption could lead to significant rewards
    but accepting the risk of failure. In line with the industry 4.0 perspective,
    the use of key technologies within emerging practices is more and more frequent
    [22]. Key technologies assume a fundamental role because they can “unlock” new
    practical applications where they are employed to achieve relevant results in
    terms of outcome, e.g., organizational or market performance [23]. Practices employing
    key technologies cannot be considered best practices since new technologies are
    potential breakthroughs that can only promise to solve business problems, but
    it is necessary to prove their real usefulness. Recently, scientific research
    has focused the attention on the adoption of key technologies to improve, convert,
    and renew traditional practices. The Industry 4.0 paradigm, based on enhancing
    productivity through digitalization, automation, and connectivity with the progress
    of key technologies, is expected to affect many aspects of society and industry
    [24]. This new concept is based on cyber–physical systems in which there is an
    integration of both virtual and physical participants. The purpose of this paradigm
    is to effectively control systems in real time by exploiting the Internet and
    other new technologies [25]. This industrial vision is considered the right solution
    for solving problems, such as accelerating innovation cycles, increasing demand
    volatility, and increasing product personalization [26]. In particular, the implementation
    of key technologies will allow industries to increase production where necessary
    through the modularity and flexibility of production systems [27]. Key technologies
    go through several stages before their general acceptance and adoption by society.
    Various standard adoption models have recently been proposed to help predicting
    the diffusion of key technologies by providing a structured perspective on the
    degree of maturity of a key technology, through different stages [28]. Among such
    adoption models, the Gartner Hype Cycle takes into account two elements—hype level
    and business maturity—and classifies a technology lifecycle into five stages:
    technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, through of disillusionment,
    slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. Then, technologies are also
    associated with three additional elements: the maturity level, the time to plateau,
    and the market penetration [29]. As a recent example, blockchain technology had
    a period of initial excitement in 2016, reached the peak of inflated expectations
    around 2018, and entered the trough of disillusionment stage at the end of 2019
    [30]. In addition to the Gartner curve, the literature suggested various standard
    curves to portray the evolution of technology over time, such as the “S-shaped”
    or logistics performance curve, showing the cumulative performance growth for
    a technology [31], [32]. In addition, in the literature, there are technology
    adoption curves that show the speed of technology adoption by both consumers and
    companies [33]. According to this approach, the adoption rate is classified into
    five different categories: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority,
    and laggards [34]. Among these categories, early adopters can be described as
    visionaries because they are the most willing to invest time and resources in
    technological innovation in order to test and validate the technologies in their
    business processes [35], [36]. In this way, early adopters motivate other companies
    to invest in certain key technologies to bridge the competitive gap [37]. The
    adoption of key technologies is considered important for companies because it
    allows them to obtain competitive advantage for two reasons: to support business
    processes in order to reduce costs and to save time by improving production yields
    [9]. However, adopting a key technology is difficult, and it is not always possible
    to predict its diffusion using these adoption models. On the one hand, firms could
    carry out an aggressive strategy and early implement the technology to maximize
    the returns from being early adopter. From the other hand, conservative strategies
    could suggest minimizing risks by adopting innovation later, when a wider number
    of positive cases of implementation have been recognized. For this reason, it
    is important to assess key technologies and their trends early on, as they may
    have an impact on future practices that could change businesses. Still, it is
    difficult to understand which emerging practices that implement key technologies
    will be the future best practices widely accepted by companies. This work provides
    a methodology to monitor the state-of-the-art of the implementation of key technologies
    in business contexts so that it is possible to find which applications have the
    highest potential for becoming best practices in the future. To contextualize
    the areas of adoption, the methodology suggests a taxonomy for technologies, industries,
    business functions, business processes, and impacts so that the most interesting
    applications can be identified by the combination of these elements. The proposed
    framework aims to guide companies toward the adoption of emerging practices through
    the application of specific key technologies in line with the perspective of industry
    4.0. The novelty of the article is to outline a map of key technologies that industrialists,
    managers, and other actors could take into account to improve business functions
    and business performance. In this way, stakeholders can consider the implementation
    of emerging practices to make decisions with greater awareness regarding the possible
    achievable results. B. Classification of Key Technologies In the literature, there
    are several works that classify and investigate key technologies in different
    areas [4], [8]. Scientific research is predominantly focused on the analysis of
    single technologies and discussion of single areas of application. For example,
    Rolandi et al. [6] classified key technologies for the agriculture sector to assess
    their possible impacts, while Gkoumas and Tsakalidis [38] evaluated the usefulness
    of key technologies in the transportation sector. Several researchers evaluated
    and classified the technologies in specific areas. For example, Ponis et al. [39]
    analyzed the influence of key technologies in the perspective of the circular
    economy. Nti et al. [40] examined the impacts that these technologies can have
    on engineering processes. Other authors investigated the positive and negative
    effects on business that digital technologies can generate within supply chains
    [41], [42]. Many studies classify the implementation of the technologies in the
    industrial environment and try to identify the challenges and benefits [43]. Others
    evaluated how the new technologies transform and improve operations management
    practices [44], [45]. Even though there is a plethora of studies that classify
    and investigate key technologies, the originality of this work consists in deeply
    exploring the impacts of various technologies in different business contexts and
    analyzing the multiple practices that could be developed by companies. This research
    aims at investigating the implementation of key technologies in all contexts,
    departing from the current literature. As shown in Table I, studies in the literature
    are limited to only some areas, such as single sectors or specific technologies.
    In consideration of the aim of this research, it is necessary to take into account
    thousands of scientific articles. The current literature considers only a few
    practices at a time and there is not a formal purpose to present a standardized
    taxonomy of key technologies. For example, many articles are focused on a specific
    area, such as supply-chain management (SCM), Industry 4.0, or the manufacturing
    industry. Moreover, the classification of key technologies is not derived from
    a deep investigation. Finally, the number of analyzed articles and the identified
    practices are much lower than in this work. This depends on the different purpose
    of this research, but it can be considered as an additional contribution since
    the wider range of analyzed articles guarantees higher robustness to the suggested
    taxonomy. TABLE I Classification of Key Technologies From Scientific Literature
    Extending the comparison to review papers, the literature is featured by several
    works that analyze a significant number of articles; however, their final purpose
    is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art of scientific research
    without identifying the emerging practices that are worthy of implementation [49],
    [50]. The suggested framework differs from the others in the literature since
    it allows the analysis with different perspectives. First, the classification
    of technologies, impacts, industries, business functions, and processes derives
    from a literature review of thousands of scientific articles and has been constantly
    updated and reviewed during the data collection. Second, this research aims at
    identifying the links among emerging practices, impacts, key technologies, business
    functions, business processes, and industries in a formal way. Hence, the novelty
    of the work, if compared with previous articles, is to focus globally on the impacts
    that key technologies can produce on business functions in multiple areas and
    sectors. Third, the proposed framework has a greater number of practices analyzed
    than the other articles currently published. SECTION III. Methodology A. Framework
    for Investigating the Adoption of Key Technologies The suggested framework aims
    at standardizing emerging practices collected from the systematic literature review.
    An emerging practice consists of the implementation of one or more key technologies
    within a specific business context in order to enhance business performance. Therefore,
    to classify and standardize information extracted from the content analysis of
    the full text of each scientific paper, an emerging practice is recorded in a
    repository as the combination of various labels referring to key technology, business
    context of application, and expected impact in terms of performance enhancement
    (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Combination of variables linked to an emerging practice.
    Show All This will allow the switch from text to categorical variables that is
    important to exploit information to perform analysis on the state-of-the-art of
    key technologies. In particular, the repository reports 87 specific key technologies,
    which are classified into 11 macrocategories. The context of application of the
    key technology within the focal emerging practice is defined with the industry
    of adoption of the practice, the business function that employs it, and the business
    process in which the technology is exploited. The variables associated with the
    business context are important. Indeed, emerging practices that employ key technologies
    are risky since there is not a consolidated implementation in businesses. To reduce
    such a risk, it is useful to define the boundaries of application of the technology
    by clarifying industry, business function, and business process where it can be
    used. As to the impact on the business performance, it can be either internal,
    i.e., the focal emerging practice enhances organizational performance, or external,
    i.e., improvements in terms of market performance can be achieved. To demonstrate
    the usefulness of this research, once identified all emerging practices within
    the scientific articles under investigation, a machine learning algorithm belonging
    to association rule mining will be employed to identify within the sample the
    most frequent and relevant emerging practices that could become future best practices
    (see Fig. 2). Therefore, starting from the entire set of emerging practices, the
    algorithm will extract a subset of those that are less risky and are more likely
    to provide the expected impact on business performance, taking into account the
    business context where the key technology is implemented. The following sections
    will provide a formal description of each variable. Fig. 2. From emerging practices
    to future best practices. Show All B. Taxonomy of Key Technologies By employing
    an inductive approach [17], [18], a taxonomy of 11 categories of key technologies
    has been built. Although some classifications are already present in the literature
    [4], [8], these only consider certain groups of key technologies, as previously
    shown in Table I. On the contrary, this research has achieved a classification
    as the result of the study of thousands of scientific articles where hundreds
    of categories of technologies were detected. From this bottom-up procedure, specific
    technologies have been detected and then grouped by macrocategories. Table II
    presents the 11 macrocategories of key technologies that in total enclose 87 specific
    technologies. TABLE II Taxonomy of Key Technologies The 3-D printing, or additive
    manufacturing, allows the construction of 3-D elements by adding material to create
    a customized geometry [51]. AI refers to intelligent agents capable of maximizing
    the chance of achieving goals, with cognitive, learning, and problem-solving capabilities
    [52]. Blockchain technology refers to decentralized and distributed digital ledgers
    consisting of blocks where transactions and information are recorded using a peer-to-peer
    network to guarantee inalterability and security of data [14]. Computing technologies
    enclose both quantum and cloud-based computing, where the former refers to technologies
    allowing great computational power, whereas the latter regards a set of information
    technologies based on on-demand availability of resources, such as storage and
    computing, which are distributed over multiple locations [53]. The digital applications
    category contains software, social networks, and digital tools, accessible from
    smartphones and browsers, which run on web servers and support paperless activities
    [54]. Geospatial technologies comprise instruments and tools to collect, process,
    and analyze geographic data [55]. Immersive environments collect technologies
    that allow immersion into virtual reality and nonphysical worlds or the employment
    of virtual instruments to enhance human perception within the real-world environment
    [56]. IoT technologies refer to connected physical devices or “things” equipped
    with sensors that collect and share information within a network over the internet
    [57]. Open and crowd-based platforms encompass a set of tools, applications, and
    platforms to employ open and crowd-based approaches, allowing access to information,
    data, knowledge, sources, software, as well as activities performed by people
    and citizens [58], [59], [60]. Proximity technologies refer to sensors, devices,
    and objects able to detect the presence of nearby elements without any physical
    contact [61]. Robotics category encloses innovative robots able to autonomously
    perform actions either partially or totally [62]. It also includes unmanned aerial
    vehicles [63]. The list has been continuously reviewed during data collection;
    therefore, the 87 specific key technologies are those predominant in the literature,
    whereas the grouping of technologies within the 11 macrocategories has followed
    the logic of technical and technological commonality, as well as similarities
    in terms of data management and performed actions. Indeed, from the one hand,
    technologies could change physical flows, performing or supporting specific actions.
    From the other hand, other technologies predominantly affect information flows.
    Table III summarizes the features of each key technology to show the complexity
    of the suggested classification. Regarding data management, key technologies can
    support data capture, data storage/transfer, or data processing. As to performed
    actions, technologies support simulation activities or perform an action with
    three opportunities: complete automation, support to human action, or execution
    of activities operated by humans. TABLE III Features of Key Technologies in Terms
    of Data Management and Performed Action C. Business Context: Industry The methodology
    takes into account 54 industries in primary, manufacturing, and tertiary sectors
    (see Table IV). To guarantee the comprehensiveness of the classification, the
    labels have been checked with other standard classifications, such as the standard
    industrial classification (SIC) codes [64]. The variable also considers a general
    category for “horizontal” applications that can be employed in all sectors. Therefore,
    the framework is suitable to support the choice of implementation of key technologies
    in all industries, whereas many systematic literature reviews focus on specific
    industries. In particular, for the primary sector, four different industries are
    found, the manufacturing sector is characterized by 21 industries, while the tertiary
    sector reports 25 labels. Three additional labels, one for each sector, refer
    to a general usefulness within the specific sector. For instance, manufacturing
    (general) encloses emerging practices that are useful for all industries within
    the manufacturing sector. TABLE IV List of Industries by Sector Reported Within
    the Framework D. Business Context: Business Function and Business Process In the
    literature, there are several articles discussing key technologies without referring
    to a specific business function but within general areas, such as SCM [65], [66]
    or Industry 4.0 [3], [67]. Some of these articles focus on specific processes,
    such as the use of key technologies in product design [68] or R&D projects [69],
    [70], [71]. However, this work aims to investigate all the different business
    functions and not focus only on some specific areas. Therefore, companies could
    decide to use key technologies by precisely identifying the business function
    concerned. Indeed, key technologies may have effects on companies even within
    apparently secondary and less discussed business functions. Hence, it is essential
    to define the area of implementation of these technologies. Actually, the business
    function specifies where the emerging practices can be carried out. In particular,
    both primary and support functions are considered (see Fig. 3). For each business
    function, a list of business processes is reported (see Table V). Therefore, the
    variable business process can be considered as a specific subcategory of the business
    function, aiming at better delineating where the emerging practice can be implemented.
    A set of 43 business processes is suggested, also considering one label for the
    business function general, which is assigned to practices that are implemented
    within all parts of the organization. The variables are useful to improve the
    applicability of the framework to multiple types of analyses. For instance, to
    study the relationship between SCM and key technologies, it is useful to select
    specific processes within the four functions distribution, marketing, operations,
    and procurement. Moreover, the identification of the process that will employ
    the key technology is indispensable to delineate the area of application where
    it is possible to achieve the expected positive impact on the business performance.
    The same technology used in a different process could not provide the same positive
    impact. Fig. 3. Primary and secondary business functions considered within the
    framework. Show All TABLE V List of Business Processes by Business Function Reported
    Within the Framework E. Impact on Business Performance This variable delineates
    the impact of key technologies on the business. In particular, an emerging practice
    could affect either external or internal performance (see Table VI). The first
    refers to performance improvements of external relationships with clients, investors,
    and stakeholders in general so that it is possible to link the adoption of a key
    technology with positive impacts on the market. The latter concerns internal positive
    effects of the implementation of key technologies within the organization, with
    positive effects in terms of time, costs, productivity, and resource efficiency.
    As follows, an explanation of all labels is provided. TABLE VI List of Impacts
    Reported Within the Framework External performance encloses attracting investors
    since key technologies enhance financial attractiveness [72] and can improve financial
    performance [73], long-term shareholder value [74], or stock price performance
    [75]. Moreover, higher external performances can be achieved in terms of brand
    reputation [76], competitive advantage [77], customer satisfaction [78], and product/service
    quality/value/differentiation [79]. Finally, the label revenues enclose all emerging
    practices that support selling activities or sales growth [80]. Internal performance
    is associated with positive impacts within business processes and activities,
    covering cost reduction [81], efficiency and productivity (e.g., reliability,
    waste reduction, and productivity) [82], energy efficiency gains [83], flexibility
    in production and design [84], and time reduction [85]. Moreover, it comprises
    the optimization of management activities associated with critical issues of a
    business, such as employee engagement [86], information management (e.g., traceability,
    better-informed decisions, control, real-time visibility, transparency, and monitoring)
    [5], innovation, knowledge and technology management (e.g., technological development,
    product innovation, digitalization, and access to new knowledge) [87], risk reduction
    (e.g., security and privacy issues, reduction of accidents at work, and reduction
    of fraudulent behaviors) [88], and supply-chain relationships management (e.g.,
    integration, coordination, collaboration, information sharing, and transparency
    among partners) [89], [90]. F. Data Collection From Scientific Articles Brooks
    argued that one of the ways in which science contributes to technology is creating
    an important knowledge base in evaluating technology in terms of social, environmental,
    and strategic business impacts and identifying industrial practices [16]. Recently,
    the rapid growth of science and technology has increased the complexity of managing
    these two issues. Fortunately, the parallel growth of information in both science
    and technology offers the possibility of advanced decision support to guide the
    activities to be carried out. In general, scientific research tends to anticipate
    the technology; therefore, academic researchers, policymakers, industrialists,
    and consultants could employ literature to plan and program decisions on the adoption
    of key technologies [15]. In particular, case studies are used to evaluate the
    advantages and disadvantages of key technologies [91], [92]. One reason for the
    case study being recognized as a research method is that researchers were becoming
    increasingly concerned about the limitations of quantitative methods in providing
    the in-depth explanations of how much key technologies impact on business [93].
    As key technologies are not adopted by most companies, their real benefits and
    disadvantages are hidden [94]. Through case study methods, a researcher is able
    to go beyond quantitative statistical results and understand the dynamics that
    key technologies may change [95]. Case studies help to explain both the process
    and the outcome of a phenomenon through the observation, reconstruction, and analysis
    of the cases under investigation [96]. For this reason, scientific research often
    presents case studies in which key technologies are implemented and this can be
    useful for generalizing emerging practices [97]. Therefore, in order to ensure
    the widest coverage level and the continuous update, emerging practices are extracted
    from the analysis of scientific papers. Indeed, some scholars have already used
    scientific papers as a source to detect emerging trends in the adoption of new
    technologies and practices, as well as other contributions have built lists of
    emerging practices from the review of relevant literature [98], [99]. However,
    this work intends to perform a systematic literature review in order to standardize
    information from scientific papers and provide the state-of-the-art of the overall
    implementation of emerging practices, useful not only for scientific purposes
    but also for managerial and organizational ones. The methodology of systematic
    literature review is particularly suitable for this research since it allows summarizing
    the evidences from primary studies through a formal research protocol. Being papers
    the source of information, it is necessary to read the full text, analyze the
    content, and process each document to assign standardized variables to each emerging
    practice. In particular, a cloud-based web application has been implemented to
    allow researchers in the field of technology, operations, and management to perform
    the activity. The researcher reads and analyzes the full text of each scientific
    paper, searching for emerging practices that employ new technologies. Since the
    identification of emerging practices is complex within the full text and the required
    information could be scattered within the document, it is not possible to implement
    an automatic script and natural language processing techniques to perform the
    process, but human interpretation is necessary. To record a practice, it is necessary
    to assign labels for each variable (i.e., key technology, industry, business function,
    business process, and impact). These predefined variables and labels guarantee
    data standardization and comparability. However, to assign labels, it is necessary
    to have a significant experience on technical and technological issues. Moreover,
    when the user detects new potential labels to assign to the variables, he/she
    can suggest the addition of a new element. Indeed, flexibility is necessary because
    new practices and technologies could manifest original features to add to the
    initial set of labels. The only “free” input field is the textual description
    of the emerging practice, where the researcher clarifies usefulness, aim, implementation,
    and peculiarities of the focal practice. In this way, activities, supported operations,
    and data employed can be better clarified. Fig. 4 shows an example of acquisition
    of information from the work presented by Chen et al. [100], where an application
    of last mile delivery using drones is suggested. From the content analysis of
    the full text and the further classification, the emerging practice is summarized
    by the combination key technology-industry-business function-business process-impact-description.
    After an additional perspective, by considering only categorical variables, each
    emerging practice is expressed by the tuple key technology-industry-business function-business
    process-impact. Fig. 4. Example of classification of an emerging practice. Show
    All The starting list of scientific papers consists of contributions published
    from January 2019 to July 2022 in the most relevant journals in the field of business,
    finance, economics, management, operations research, management science, and accounting,
    according to ISI Web of Science and Scimago Journal Ranking, focusing on journals
    reported in either Q1 or Q2 in at least one of the sources. Then, the list of
    scientific papers was searched on SCOPUS by creating a specific search query for
    each technology. In particular, for each key technology, specific contents, which
    refer to either the category or the specific technologies, are searched within
    title and keywords fields. For instance, the following query was used to search
    for papers investigating immersive environments: (TITLE (“immersive environments”)
    or KEY (“immersive environments”) or TITLE (“augmented reality”) or KEY (“augmented
    reality”) or TITLE (“digital human”) or KEY (“digital human”) or TITLE (“holograms”)
    or KEY (“holograms”) or TITLE (“metaverse”) or KEY (“metaverse”) or TITLE (“virtual
    reality”) or KEY (“virtual reality”) or TITLE (“mixed reality”) or KEY (“mixed
    reality”) or TITLE (“digital twin”) or KEY (“digital twin”) or TITLE (“gamification”)
    or KEY (“gamification”)). The researchers search for a paper, and then manually
    read and study the entire document, with three available options: paper not found,
    paper not useful, or paper useful. The first regards documents whose electronic
    version is not downloadable from the Internet, whereas the second regards papers
    where no business practices were found. Indeed, an important ratio of not useful
    documents is found since many papers focus on the “policymaker” or “macroeconomic”
    perspective, as well as on “technological” and “technical” issues of key technologies.
    The paper is considered useful only if it presents the implementation of an emerging
    practice. To add an emerging practice, the information extracted from the paper
    has to provide a clear association with all variables under investigation. When
    not sufficient detail is provided, the practice is disregarded. Furthermore, practices
    are recorded only if there is an exhaustive description of their functioning,
    which data employ, why they are used, which is the aim of implementing them, how
    they allow the firm achieving goals and enhance business performance, who employs
    the technology, and why they are different from traditional practices. Scientific
    papers were assigned to only one researcher at a time, but at the end of the analysis,
    a second researcher (i.e., reviewer) revised the analysis of the colleague. Eventual
    doubts regarding the labels assigned are solved with a joint activity of the researcher
    and the reviewer. At the end of July 2022, the number of searched papers is 22 337
    on a total of about 50 000 documents deriving from the sum of the results of 11
    queries on SCOPUS. Therefore, the investigated sample is statistically significant
    to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of key technologies. In particular,
    1165 documents were not available on the Internet, whereas 21 172 were downloaded
    and examined for a ratio of about 95% of searched papers. Among the analyzed papers,
    5442 report at least an emerging practice, i.e., one-fourth of available documents
    (see Fig. 5). More than 100 man months were necessary to perform the research,
    engaging 10 researchers expert in the field of engineering and technology management
    from January 2020 to July 2022. The final sample consists of 15 708 different
    combinations key technology-industry-business function-business process-impact-description.
    Since the same labels for categorical variables can be the same for multiple emerging
    practices, by considering only the distinct number of tuples, key technology-industry-business
    function-business process-impact the dataset reports 11 049 elements. It is interesting
    to consider that the potential number of available combinations is about 3.4 million,
    i.e., 87 technologies × 54 industries × 43 processes × 17 impacts. This means
    that, to date, the share of possible combinations that have been already found
    a real implementation is 0.32%, underscoring that a minimal part of the available
    combinations has been already explored in the literature and practice. This also
    underlines the high unexpressed potential value of key technologies. Fig. 5. Output
    of the systematic literature review on emerging practices. Show All The journals
    exhibiting the larger number of useful papers are: Applied Energy, Applied Sciences,

    SECTION IV. Findings To let emerge the explicative power of the methodology, this
    section presents an exploratory study on the repository of 15 708 emerging practices.
    First, descriptive statistics of each categorical variable are presented to provide
    a general overview of the state-of-the-art. Second, an explorative analysis is
    carried out in order to detect the most frequent and robust combinations of labels
    that define which are the emerging practices that are the best candidates to become
    future best practices. The analysis is performed by implementing a machine learning
    algorithm belonging to the category of association rule mining. A. Descriptive
    Statistics In this section, a first analysis of the distribution of practices
    for each categorical variable is presented. Table VII presents the number of practices
    employing key technologies. It reports both the macrotechnology and, for short,
    only the belonging specific technologies that cover at least 1% of the entire
    dataset. AI is the most frequent and covers about one-third of the emerging practices;
    also blockchain, robotics, and digital applications are associated to many opportunities
    of implementation. TABLE VII Emerging Practices by Macrocategory of Key Technologies
    and Specific Key Technology Table VIII presents the top industries that cover
    more than 1% of the entire dataset. About 15% of practices are associated with
    the general adoption within the entire manufacturing sector, which is the natural
    habitat for key technologies deriving from Industry 4.0 paradigm. It is interesting
    to underscore the significant value associated with the healthcare industry, which
    confirms the relevance of “health technologies,” as well as the wide range of
    opportunities for implementation of key technologies in the field of transportation.
    TABLE VIII Top Industries Reporting Emerging Practices To summarize the relationship
    between emerging practices and industry of application, Table IX groups practices
    by sectors, underscoring that manufacturing and tertiary are featured by a larger
    number of emerging practices compared with the primary sector. TABLE IX Emerging
    Practices by Sector Moreover, Table X presents the count of practices by business
    function. In addition, only the belonging business processes covering at least
    1% of the total number of practices are reported. It is interesting to underscore
    that the practices permeate all business functions. Even though many of them are
    associated with primary functions, such as operations and distribution, results
    show that the adoption of key technologies could provide opportunities for business
    performance improvement also within ancillary functions. Since most of the research
    on key technologies is focused on SCM, results suggest expanding and investigating
    the implementation toward secondary areas, such as accounting and finance, human
    resources management, and governance and administration. As to the most frequent
    processes, operations planning, and control, production of goods and provision
    of services are prevailing, confirming the significant weight of the operations
    function, which covers about 50% of the total number of emerging practices. TABLE
    X Emerging Practices by Business Function and Process Regarding the impact on
    business performance, about 20% of practices allow efficiency and productivity
    enhancements, but also costs reduction and improvements in terms of information
    management cover a significant share. Yet, key technologies are also able to enhance
    customer satisfaction and product/service quality/value/differentiation. Grouping
    emerging practices by impact areas results show that improvements in terms of
    internal performance feature over 75% of emerging practices (see Table XI). TABLE
    XI Emerging Practices by Impact on the Business Performance B. Explorative Analysis
    of Emerging Practices In order to exhibit the opportunity deriving from the implementation
    of the methodology, an explorative analysis of the emerging practices is presented.
    Since the dataset consists of categorical variables, text mining techniques employing
    machine learning algorithms have been preferred. The use of machine learning for
    data analytics is growing in the literature and practice since it allows finding
    patterns among variables. In particular, emerging practices are featured by tuples
    industry-business function-business process-key technology-impact. This means
    that emerging practices are summarized as the use of a technology within a specific
    business context in order to achieve a specific impact on the business performance.
    Hence, the aim of this section is to show the most interesting combinations of
    variables that can be considered valuable, robust, and with the higher likelihood
    of achieving the expected impact, i.e., the “top emerging practices.” In other
    words, with this section, the following question is answered: Which are the most
    frequent and relevant emerging practices that could become future best practices?
    To find the most interesting combinations, association rule mining techniques
    have been employed. This research uses the frequent-pattern growth algorithm (FP-Growth),
    a tree-based mining method proposed by Han et al. [101], which can extract frequent
    groups of items and association rules from large datasets. An itemset is a group
    of one or more items that are found together in the dataset. If a subset of elements
    X is extracted from an itemset, it is possible to predict the probability of finding
    the remaining elements Y. This relationship is an association rule, which is logically
    expressed as the following implication: {X}→{Y}. View Source The set X is the
    antecedent and Y is the consequent. The combination {X, Y} is transformed into
    an association rule where the occurrence of {X} is associated to the presence
    of {Y}. Association rules can select the most interesting itemsets by exploiting
    two variables, i.e., support and confidence [102]. Indeed, once determined the
    list of itemsets, the support count (#s) can be estimated as the frequency of
    occurrence of each itemset in the dataset. Moreover, the parameter confidence
    (c) can be calculated as the ratio of the sum of the dataset containing the set
    of X U Y itemsets on the count of records reporting the set of X item [103]. In
    line with this framework (see Fig. 1), the antecedent consists of the technology
    within the business context, whereas the consequent is the impact on business
    performance {technology, business context}→{impact}. View Source Hence, the occurrence
    of a technology within a business context is associated with the presence of a
    specific impact. The number of occurrences in which the combination {technology,
    business context, impact} appears in the database is #s, whereas the likelihood
    of finding {impact} as the consequent when the antecedents are {technology, business
    context} is c. In particular, the variable key technology can be expressed by
    either considering the 11 macrocategories or the 87 specific elements, whereas
    the business context can be defined with industry, business function, and business
    process. Moreover, the impact can be expressed by either the 17 labels presented
    in Section III-D or the two macrocategories, i.e., external and internal performance.
    In consideration of the features of association rule mining, for this exploratory
    research, the technology is represented through the 11 macrocategories, whereas
    the business context is summarized by the variables industry and business process.
    As to the impact, to simplify the representation of the results, the tradeoff
    between the external and internal performance is preferred. {macrotechnology,
    industry, business process} →{macroimpact}. View Source In terms of the potential
    number of possible combinations, with this group of categorical variables, the
    maximum output is of 51 084 elements, i.e., 11 macrotechnologies × 54 industries
    × 43 processes × 2 impacts. By implementing the FP-growth algorithm, it is possible
    to find out the most useful rules that suggest the implementation of a particular
    technology within a business context in order to enhance business performance.
    To extract the most interesting rules, only those satisfying minimum thresholds
    for support and confidence are considered. In particular, the threshold support
    value (#s) was set as 10, whereas the threshold confidence value (c) is 0.50.
    This allows to select the most frequent rules (#s) that are relevant for each
    antecedent (c). The FP-growth algorithm starts defining the frequent itemsets
    and creates the FP-tree, and then it scans each node of the three in order to
    find interesting rules according to the two thresholds. To launch the algorithm,
    a PHP web application has been implemented. Results show 879 associations, but
    only 262 are considered for the analysis. The other are nonsignificant since they
    either report other variables as the consequent or not all the three expected
    elements are reported as antecedents. By considering the potential number of possible
    combinations, the captured associations cover 0.51%. Since this research focuses
    on emerging practices, which are risky and costly to implement, this limited group
    of emerging practices is the perfect candidate for future best practices. This
    is possible, thanks to the joint effect of the support threshold and confidence
    threshold. The support threshold allows considering the most frequent combinations,
    i.e., the best combinations are those that have been mostly tested and applied
    in the literature. The confidence threshold supports the selection of only those
    combinations {macrotechnology, industry, business process} that have a likelihood
    higher than 50% of achieving a specific impact on the business performance, hence
    neglecting the combinations exhibiting the less likely impacts. From the analysis
    of the extracted rules, a general consideration is that only about 10% of associations
    suggest an impact on external performance, hence delineating a prevalent stability
    of enhancement of internal performance when key technologies are implemented in
    organizations. Moreover, at least a combination for each macrotechnology has been
    found, even though those reporting AI, blockchain, and IoT are prevailing. As
    to industries, 29 out of 54 elements report at least an emerging practice, with
    labels general and manufacturing (general) covering about one-third of the association
    rules. A total of 32 out of 43 processes have been reported within association
    rules, with a prevalence of those within business function operations. As follows,
    for each macrotechnology, the list of combinations is reported and commented on.
    The 3-D printing will allow new production methodologies and opportunities to
    improve internal performance in manufacturing industries in general as well as
    specific applications in R&D intensive sectors featured by market and product
    complexity are growing (see Table XII). In particular, some 3-D printing processes
    allow the production of pieces with superior mechanical features in a reduced
    time, useful for aerospace and automotive applications. Moreover, in the biomedical
    industry, 3-D printing is the optimal solution to manufacture components with
    biocompatible materials and antibacterial properties that are designed with advanced
    3-D modeling software in order to be totally customized with the specifics of
    each patient. It is also useful in industries, such as healthcare, where it is
    necessary to fabricate parts and instruments quickly and locally to satisfy the
    variable and difficult-to-forecast product demand with a limited lead time. Additional
    interesting applications regard the opportunity of manufacturing houses and buildings
    through additive manufacturing. Moreover, 3-D printing is useful for design and
    rapid prototyping since it ensures flexibility and the development of complex
    geometries, minimizing material consumption and waste generation. TABLE XII 3-D
    Printing—Top Emerging Practices AI reports 84 distinct association rules, covering
    one-third of the entire list (see Table XIII). It is doubtless a priority technology
    for emerging practices, covering 27 industries and 21 business processes. It is
    implementable within all business functions, from primary to ancillary. For instance,
    within the governance and administration function, AI can be employed to generate
    scenarios, estimate the performance of assets, and support decision making and
    planning. AI is the most promising technology to implement smart manufacturing
    systems and optimize SCM, but it is also useful for the tertiary sector. It is
    capable of analyzing information and data and exploiting them to revolutionize
    how services are provided. Even though it will support companies in enhancing
    their internal performance, in some industries, emerging practices employing it
    to achieve external performance are growing. In particular, AI is used for market
    analysis. Blockchain technology is very promising, especially for the manufacturing
    sector (see Table XIV). It positively affects internal impact, mainly in three
    areas. First, it is possible to find blockchain applications for the management
    of supply-chain operations. It reduces transaction-based costs, solves trust issues,
    improves real-time traceability, and protects product counterfeiting. Second,
    blockchain affects financial transactions with both the adoption of cryptocurrencies
    and the implementation of smart contracts to achieve automatic payment. Third,
    it adds security to data, changing management policies. For instance, blockchain
    defends companies against insider attacks and alteration of records, providing
    accessibility, authenticity verification, authorization, and security to information
    and preserving the privacy of employees, partners, clients, and devices. Its architecture
    is scalable and highly efficient and provides new instruments for management,
    processing, and control of large data traffic from people and devices. TABLE XIII
    AI—Top Emerging Practices TABLE XIV Blockchain—Top Emerging Practices Computing
    technologies change the way in which data are stored, shared, and processed (see
    Table XV). From the one hand, the entire manufacturing sector can rely on these
    technologies to improve operations. Computing technologies, such as cloud and
    edge computing, allow efficient and real-time data transmission and processing,
    which are necessary features to monitor processes in real time, detect issues,
    maintain high productivity, and optimize production scheduling. Moreover, computing
    technologies provide computational power to many tools and applications used for
    operations. From the other hand, computing will enable the implementation of new
    ways of providing services by guaranteeing real-time monitoring and tracking of
    activities, which are particularly useful for sectors, such as healthcare and
    transportation. For instance, shipping systems can rely on computing technologies
    to share information about the shipment with the customer as well as to calculate
    the delivery time. The computational power of computing technologies allows the
    effective management of resources, providing support to the calculation of routes
    and the scheduling of the transport system. TABLE XV Computing—Top Emerging Practices
    Digital applications are the category exhibiting the higher number of emerging
    practices affecting external performance (see Table XVI). In particular, chatbots,
    web applications, apps, and social networks will provide support to clients and
    guarantee real-time services with higher service levels. Chatbots handle customer
    queries in a timely and correct manner, improving the customer experience and
    helping clients connect to the brand as well as they optimize customer decision-making
    performance. Moreover, they also collect information about clients, useful to
    customize the product offer and understand market needs. Social media solutions
    are fundamental to implement a two-way symmetrical and interactive communication
    with customers, increasing customer experience, reducing negative feedback, and
    providing opportunities to foster stronger relationships. Digital applications
    are also useful for enhancing internal performance since they will support internal
    operations by providing instruments and tools for employees. In addition, robotic
    process automation helps organizations to save costs of operations by no longer
    having to rely on customers or to outsource tasks. They can also be considered
    as an instrument to optimize supply chains since they provide a common language
    to supply-chain members, e.g., by implementing application programming interfaces
    (APIs) and webservices to share information and manage supply-chain relationships.
    TABLE XVI Digital Applications—Top Emerging Practices Geospatial technologies
    could enhance internal performance by providing information to support decision
    making in planning and management of some services (see Table XVII). They find
    interesting applications in public utilities, such as electric power, energy,
    and water. Geospatial technologies are used to find the optimal location of storage
    centers—mapping and checking the features of the surrounding areas, to plan local,
    regional, and national resource capacity and distribution, and collect data for
    the effective resource management and supply. Additionally, they probably represent
    the most promising key technology to enhance business performance in the primary
    sector. For instance, geospatial technologies allow field mapping, crop phase
    monitoring, disease management, yield estimation, soil mapping, weed mapping,
    and hotspot for disease incidence. Applications of geospatial technologies cover
    not only strategic planning and operations management but also distribution logistics.
    They provide information to transportation planning applications to optimize routes,
    monitor hijacking, improve fuel and time efficiencies, and monitor driver behavior.
    TABLE XVII Geospatial Technologies—Top Emerging Practices The main opportunities
    of exploiting immersive environments are twofold (see Table XVIII). First, they
    are useful to improve internal performance in the manufacturing sector, with a
    focus on operations, R&D, and distribution. For instance, warehouse management
    can be beneficial of augmented reality through the use of smart glasses to help
    operators with order picking. Digital twin will revolutionize various operations’
    processes, such as maintenance and diagnostics, since it possesses data from the
    physical entity and employs it to build a digital model useful for anomaly detection,
    fault diagnosis, predictive maintenance, performance analysis, and production
    quality prediction. Second, immersive environments are promising technologies
    for marketing, e.g., to show virtual catalogues or presentation of products. During
    COVID-19 emergency, they are also replacing traditional communication channels
    and supporting revenues. Indeed, the external performance can be improved by employing
    them to build a new sale channel to sell products or provide services, e.g., through
    virtual rooms to try products or virtual tours in locations and museums. Moreover,
    immersive environments, such as augmented and virtual reality, support customer
    satisfaction. TABLE XVIII Immersive Environments—Top Emerging Practices IoT is
    fundamental for collecting information necessary to monitor and control processes
    as well as for transferring and sharing information (see Table XIX). In SCM, it
    is used to improve the relationship with both upstream and downstream partners.
    For instance, for a better management of procurement activities, IoT digitalizes
    activities and helps real-time monitoring of partners. IoT allows the monitoring
    of pallets in real time from the factory to the distribution center, from warehouse
    to warehouse, and during transit and storage. For the manufacturing sector, it
    has also consolidated applications in operations management, enhancing internal
    performance. Indeed, it allows machines to communicate with each other and to
    implement smart production with networking and remote technologies, such as fault
    diagnosis, monitoring of operations, and transmission of information and instructions
    to other machines, supply-chain members, and employees. However, stable emerging
    practices have been found for specific sectors. In the agriculture one, IoT solutions
    collect data on plantations to support crop monitoring, disease prevention, and
    irrigation control. In the electric power industry, sensors are installed to monitor
    the health status of the network and collect information useful to predict future
    failures and outages that may occur in the distribution lines. TABLE XIX IoT—Top
    Emerging Practices Open and crowd-based platforms have three main categories of
    frequent applications (see Table XX). First, the use of open data, open access,
    and open source allows access to important information and applications to support
    processes, such as the optimization of the services provided in the healthcare
    industry. Second, open innovation and crowdsourcing platforms support innovation,
    knowledge, and technology management in the manufacturing sector. Firms can create
    open spaces to present R&D challenges to a crowd of solvers, develop and find
    creative solutions to established problems, as well as engage a crowd in the early
    stages of innovation and product development processes. Third, the implementation
    of crowdsourcing and crowdshipping platforms, in particular referring to delivery
    and logistics’ services, provides advantages in terms of internal performance.
    Indeed, crowdsourcing delivery can be useful to dramatically shorten delivery
    times and minimize last mile delivery costs. Specific platforms can be implemented
    to create match between parcel delivery tasks and ad-hoc drivers, mainly by implementing
    algorithms for automatic association and definition of optimized delivery routes.
    TABLE XX Open and Crowd-Based Platforms—Top Emerging Practices Proximity technologies
    allow real-time monitoring of inventories and operations (see Table XXI). In the
    transportation and logistics industry, it is possible to track and trace the movement
    of products in a supply chain and control the entire transportation process in
    order to reduce the loading, unloading, and transportation time, find counterfeits
    and identifying inconsistencies. In the manufacturing sector, it is used to optimize
    warehousing activities and managing inventories. Moreover, by using biometrics,
    it is possible to track employees, authenticate and verify the identity, understand
    behaviors, and check their performance. In the retail industry, improvements in
    terms of external performance can be achieved by implementing proximity technologies,
    such as eye tracking and radio-frequency identification (RFID), to study clients
    and customer decision making and provide personalized assistance during the purchase
    and information about the availability of products. In the food and beverage industry,
    information acquired by proximity technologies is used to improve the safety and
    the quality of the food since captured data can be shared and published in a traceability
    system. Clients can scan a QR code and access to information about product, process,
    provenance, and company information. TABLE XXI Proximity Technologies—Top Emerging
    Practices Robotics can be implemented in many business processes and industries
    (see Table XXII). The potential implementation of drones, autonomous vehicles,
    and other technologies included into robotics will improve the performance of
    warehouse, transportation, and delivery activities. As to last mile delivery,
    new organizational models can be implemented, with many opportunities of optimizing
    time, cost, and quality of the service. Regarding the manufacturing sector, the
    opportunity of implementing robotics to replace/support the human being or implement
    automation is the main opportunity of internal performance enhancement. However,
    robotics’ technologies also find stable applications for the management of operations
    in industries belonging to the tertiary sector, such as healthcare, hotels and
    accommodation, restaurant and café, and retail. In particular, service robots
    have proved their usefulness in robotic-assisted surgery and support to patients,
    as well as to perform front-of-house operations (information provision, service
    delivery, check-in, and check-out) and back-of-house operations (cleaning, disinfection,
    and vacuuming the floor). TABLE XXII Robotics—Top Emerging Practices SECTION V.
    Discussion A. Theoretical Contribution The research confirms the power of key
    technologies in increasing business performance and their significant role in
    unlocking new practical applications and emerging practices. Despite the risks
    in implementing emerging practices, firms and early adopters can limit such risks
    by selecting those that fit with the belonging industry, the business function/process,
    and the specific needs of performance improvement. From the combination of the
    variables, it emerges that less than 1% of possible tuples has been detected from
    the systematic literature review. After the theoretical point of view, this suggests
    that research could explore a multitude of additional possible combinations in
    order to test the usefulness of key technologies in other business contexts. Considering
    all industries, business functions, and business processes, the research demonstrates
    that key technologies are available for many contexts, sometimes neglected by
    both scientific research and companies. Therefore, improvements in performance
    can be reached not only within primary business functions but also within secondary
    ones. For instance, human resource management, strategic planning, and financial
    processes can be supported by key technologies. Moreover, there is space for implementing
    technologies in all industries and not only in the manufacturing ones, underscoring
    the pervasive role of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. In particular, the tertiary industry
    reports a significant number of available emerging practices as well as interesting
    opportunities have been uncovered also for the primary. However, research confirms
    that the main advancements are present in industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare,
    and transportation and logistics. Furthermore, from the analysis of results, the
    type of impact that predominantly can be achieved by implementing emerging practices
    is internal performance enhancement. This means that, at the current stage of
    technical evolution, key technologies are predominantly implemented to improve
    the performance of internal processes. This means that technologies are primarily
    seen as an opportunity to change internal activities and enhance internal performance,
    while the implications for external performance are secondary. Probably, when
    a key technology switches to a further stage of evolution, and people and society
    exhibit interest in it, this acknowledgement drives companies in trying to exploit
    it also to achieve market advantages. An additional theoretical contribution regards
    the suggested taxonomy of 11 key technologies. Indeed, the classification derives
    from the analysis of thousands of scientific articles; therefore, it is robust
    and exhibits specific peculiarities of each key technology. Such a taxonomy could
    be the starting point for other research articles aiming at investigating key
    technologies. To our knowledge, no previous contribution analyzing thousands of
    scientific papers is found in the literature. Such a classification is not in
    contrast with other taxonomies suggested by the literature [4], [8] but can be
    considered more exhaustive, also in terms of number of categories of key technologies.
    Moreover, the research confirms the usefulness of scientific papers in order to
    portray the state-of-the-art of technology development and suggests the implementation
    of key technologies and emerging practices, underscoring the peculiarities of
    each technology [15], [92], [104]. The methodology demonstrates that scientific
    literature can be used as a source of useful information to build a repository
    of emerging practices. By employing the suggested framework, it is possible to
    study the evolution of a key technology and understand whether it can be used
    only within specific industries and business functions/processes or it has general
    usefulness. B. Methodological Contribution The framework for investigating key
    technologies and emerging practices is the main contribution of this research.
    It is an original framework supporting researchers and companies in building a
    repository of emerging practices. The methodology proposed to perform a systematic
    literature review allows users to extract information from scientific research
    to study the evolution of the implementation of key technologies in all business
    contexts. Each practice is associated with a series of standardized variables—key
    technology, industry, business function, business process, and impact—in order
    to allow a firm to filter and detect the list of the best promising practices
    that fit with the objectives of business performance enhancement. Compared with
    other repositories, it is a larger dataset, which can be continuously updated,
    being scientific literature the source of information. For instance, the actual
    version of the SCOR model, which is one of the most acknowledged frameworks that
    collects business practices, is four years old, which is a time interval not compatible
    with the concept of emerging practice. Moreover, the number of emerging practices
    is significantly higher, not comparable with other research projects [4], [8].
    It is also useful to underscore that each practice is associated with a scientific
    paper; therefore, it is possible to further study in depth the document to capture
    additional information useful for the implementation of the emerging practice.
    The use of scientific literature as a source to capture emerging practices implies
    a significant research activity to update the repository but guarantees the opportunity
    to record pioneering and radical opportunities of adoption of key technologies
    [105]. C. Practical and Managerial Implications The suggested framework could
    be the basis for the implementation of a practical tool that firms could employ
    to make decisions about the adoption of emerging practices and carry out “early
    adopter” strategies in line with the perspective of Industry 4.0. Indeed, firms,
    researchers, and business analysts could replicate the methodology to build a
    repository of emerging business practices that can be directly accessed by stakeholders.
    It could be possible to perform specific queries to filter practices by industry,
    business function, business process or impact on the business performance, and
    obtain a list of emerging practices that fit with the desired outcome. As follows,
    an example of how it is possible to transform the methodology into a practical
    instrument is provided. It is possible for a firm to access a list of emerging
    practices by considering five steps of filtering in order to select the specific
    practical application that totally fits with the business. At the first step,
    it is necessary to define the belonging industry of the focal firm so that only
    emerging practices in line with the field of application will be considered. A
    second step requires the identification of the desired outcome (impact) that the
    focal company intends to achieve. Indeed, the specific performance need “pushes”
    toward the selection of technologies that are potentially capable of supporting
    the achievement of the result. Moreover, the decision maker defines the business
    function as well as the business process, where it intends to carry out the new
    practices. Then, the potential technologies that should be implemented are reported
    so that it is possible to select the preferred key technology. Finally, a list
    of emerging practices that employ the focal technology, fitting with the belonging
    industry, the desired outcome, and the selected business function/process can
    be obtained. Each practice represents an opportunity of employing the key technology,
    i.e., the availability of an application of key technology that, once implemented,
    is likely to improve the business performance. Since the repository will report
    only proven practical applications of key technologies, the procedure could lead
    the user toward the selection of uncommon practices that have the potential of
    departing from common processes, providing competitive advantage or significant
    cost savings, with more restricted and reduced risks of adoption. The suggested
    procedure is particularly flexible, and it is possible to customize the steps
    of filtering according to the desired logic of implementation. For instance, “technology
    push” approaches should suggest placing the selection of key technologies before
    the labels impact and business function/process so that once selected the desired
    technology to implement, the firm should understand which is its potential impact.
    Table XXIII provides an example of implementation within the food and beverage
    industry: a firm aiming at reducing distribution costs will detect the opportunity
    of using IoT. In particular, a practice employing sensors to monitor the integrity
    of products is suggested. TABLE XXIII Example of Implementation Within the Food
    and Beverage Industry Since the repository reports only proven practical applications
    of key technologies, the framework leads the user toward the selection of uncommon
    practices that have the potential of departing from common processes, providing
    competitive advantage or significant cost savings. This will reduce risks and
    uncertainties associated with the adoption of key technologies within the organization
    since each practice is associated with a scientific paper where information about
    the context of implementation of the practice is appropriately described. Therefore,
    by finding similarities between the case study and the real context of the firm,
    the riskiness of the investment can be confined within a more acceptable limit.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion The aim of the research is to present a framework for performing
    a systematic literature review aiming at supporting the adoption of key technologies
    and suggesting emerging practices that fit with the firm''s context of application,
    also considering belonging industry, business function and business process, where
    to implement the technology, and the desired business impact. Having recorded
    thousands of emerging practices, it was possible to perform an analysis on the
    11 categories of key technologies. Results show interesting insights regarding
    the use of key technologies and the relationship with business performance. Since
    emerging practices are gathered from scientific papers, results can be considered
    as a valid basis to suggest future implementation of key technologies and the
    adoption of those emerging practices that are the most interesting and candidate
    to become future best practices. In this article, it was necessary to underscore
    some limitations that were a consequence of the dataset employed for the research.
    Emerging practices were detected from the analysis of a sample of scientific papers
    published from January 2019 to July 2022, while many other documents were available
    in the literature, also considering other sources not included in this research.
    The research was limited to papers where specific words were reported in title
    or abstract. It cannot be excluded that other scientific contributions could be
    useful for the enrichment of the repository. Moreover, despite the use of standardized
    labels, the researchers provided a personal interpretation of the content of a
    paper; therefore, it cannot be excluded that there may be errors in the registration
    of practices, albeit to a limited extent. Additionally, scientific papers cannot
    exhaustively consider all possible applications of key technologies, which could
    not be recorded within the repository. For instance, some emerging practices could
    have been adopted by companies and industries but have not been captured by scientific
    research. Furthermore, the suggested impacts in terms of external and internal
    performance also depend on the features of the firm that implements the technology,
    i.e., structural, organizational, and management issues. Moreover, even though
    the repository collects worldwide applications of key technologies, the framework
    does not consider country-level variables. The digital maturity and the infrastructures
    of a country could affect the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes. Therefore,
    the framework aims only at suggesting potential opportunities for business improvements,
    but the real impact could be reached also depending on other internal and external
    factors. Future research will be addressed in implementing other statistical instruments
    and machine learning techniques to analyze the repository, such as clustering
    tools and decision trees. Furthermore, since some practices employ more than one
    key technology at a time, it is interesting to study the co-occurrence of key
    technologies in order to capture information about the impact of conjunct implementations
    and the deriving synergies. NOTE Open Access provided by ‘Università degli Studi

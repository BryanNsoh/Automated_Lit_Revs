    Metrics Abstract: Deployment of internet of things (IoT) devices, wireless sensors,
    and sensor networks, in agriculture can be a great help in monitoring environment
    and growing crops; and having a network to support those devices is necessary
    to successfully utilize those resources. Recently, low-power wide area network
    (LPWAN) have been recognized as an appropriate technology for agriculture use.
    LoRa is a representative network of low-power wide area network (LPWAN). It can
    be applied to IoT for agriculture due to its long range and low power capabilities.
    LoRa network performance is highly affected by physical layer parameters and the
    environment. While LPWANs have been around for a number of years, they are still
    considered an emerging technology and have had few scientific studies performed.
    Currently, most studies have shown LoRa communication capabilities in urban, mountainous,
    and maritime areas, with little focus on agriculture use cases. Tree farming is
    a long-term investment, requiring careful monitoring to mitigate loss; therefore,
    this paper provides an analysis about the impact of variant physical layer parameters
    on performance of LoRa networks in a tree farm. Overall, the LoRa communication
    range was smaller than the theoretically expected range. Some PHY factors, spreading
    factor and coding rate, showed a clear impact on LoRa performance. Actual data
    reliability was inconsistent at varying distances and PHY configurations, unlike
    the consistency found in the RSSI reported by the radios. Additional experiments
    show the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks. All experiments were performed
    in an Indiana rural tree plantation in the United States. Each node was set differently
    by modulating spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate using 915MHz and 13
    dBm transmit power at variant distance. Published in: 2018 IEEE Sensors Applications

    Conference Location: Seoul, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction There is obvious
    benefit to agricultural IoT. Data collected from wirelessly connected sensors
    and agricultural equipment can ease the difficulty of monitoring farmland and
    livestock, and assist farmers'' decision making. To apply IoT technology in an
    agricultural environment, one must consider how these devices are connected. The
    network system for agricultural IoT has to cover a wide area of farmland without
    relying on costly cellular networks. A low-power wide area network (LPWAN) is
    a well-suited solution for this purpose. LPWAN is a type of wireless network designed
    to allow long range communications at a low bit-rate. End devices can communicate
    with base stations from longer distances than other wireless network systems while
    consuming very less energy. Some LPWANs available include Sigfox, Weightless-N,
    NB-IoT and LoRa. Each network has its advantages and disadvantages. Though it
    is a fairly new technology, LoRa has attracted a lot of attention, especially
    in terms of low costs and excellent battery performance. LoRa''s modulation developed
    traditional spread-spectrum communications more robust by generating chirp signal
    that changes frequency continuously [14]. Much of the research on LoRa is relevant
    to its potential for covering large areas. Unfortunately, most of the studies
    have been conducted in open or urban environments with only a few were related
    to agriculture [5], [7]. To provide consistent and efficient management of large
    farmlands, measurements need to be taken of LoRa network potential for those areas.
    Especially in a tree farm, it takes at least 6 years and up to several decades
    to harvest timber. Even minor failures can result in wasting long-term efforts
    and large investments. Therefore, to verify its potential for agriculture, we
    focused on experimenting changes in LoRa network performance, range, reliability,
    and RSSI, according to different physical layer parameters and how each affects
    it. In addition, by examining traditional Fresnel zone limitations, the LoRa performance
    affected could be measured. SECTION II. Background LPWANs supplements short range
    wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with their large-scale coverage
    at decent cost. Instead of narrowing bandwidth to increase signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNR) like other LPWANs, LoRa uses a special chirp spread spectrum modulation
    to cover large areas. Below are some details of LoRaWAn and physical factors consisting
    of LoRaWAn physical layer. A. LORAWAN LoRa is a chirp spread spectrum modulation
    scheme using wideband linear frequency which improves receiver sensitivity and
    tolerance to miscommunication between receiver and transmitter [9]. LoRaWAn technology
    mainly uses star network topology. The gateways receive messages from multiple
    end-devices and end-devices are connected to one or more gateways. End-devices
    can transmit data to gateways with own time interval and data rate complying rules.
    These base stations are connected to other network servers via standard IP connections
    [4]. The base station and end-devices can communicate bidirectionally with good
    coverage. LoRaWAn networks have three classes based on basic features and additional
    features. Class A end-devices (basic LoRaWan) provide bi-directional communications.
    Those communications consume the lowest power. Their downlink communication occurs
    from the server following uplink transmission. Class B additionally provides a
    scheduled receive slot trough opening extra receive windows. The servers know
    if end-devices are listening. Class C provides bi-directional communication with
    maximal receive slots for minimum latency [9]. LoRa Technology has some key features.
    LoRa has scalability in bandwidth. Additionally, LoRa can be used with both narrowband
    and wideband service with a few configuration changes. LoRa has great reliability
    as it resists the Doppler Effect, multipath, fading mechanisms, and other interference
    mechanisms [14]. Its protocol is designed specifically for low power consumption
    extending battery lifetime up to 20 years. A single base station can penetrate
    into dense urban/indoor regions, and can connect rural areas up to 30 miles away.
    The last feature is low cost. LoRa reduces costs in three ways: infrastructure
    investment, operating expenses and end-node sensors. LoRa uses license-free sub
    Gigahertz radio frequency bands like 169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe) and 915
    MHz (North America). Since LoRa uses license-free frequency bands, network costs
    can be minimized [11]. B. PHY Factors PHY factors underlie all of three classes
    of LoRaWan. The configuration of LoRa can be tuned by controlling physical layer
    (PHY) settings, which results in performance changes. In this research, physical
    settings include spreading factor(SF), bandwidth(BW), and error correction rate(CR).
    1) Spreading factor (SF) The basic premise of spread spectrum is that each bit
    of information is encoded as multiple chips. Spreading factor(SF) is the relationship
    between the bit and chip [9]. A higher SF increases the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR),
    and thus sensitivity and range, but also increases the air time of the packet
    [4]. Available SF''s are from 6 to 12 which change LoRaWAn data rates from 0.3
    kbps to 27 kbps. 2) Bandwidth (BW) Bandwidth (BW) is the range of frequencies
    in the transmission band. LoRa can have 125 to 500 KHz of bandwidth, typically
    set to 125, 250, or 500KHz. Changing BW can influence message time on air which
    results in inverse influence on radio sensitivity. Larger BW gives a higher data
    rate (thus shorter time on air), but a lower sensitivity (due to integration of
    additional noise). A smaller BW gives a higher sensitivity, but a lower data rate.
    3) Coding Rate (CR) Coding Rate(CR) is a form of Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    that permits the recovery of bits of information due to corruption by interference.
    This requires a small overhead of additional encoding of the data in the transmitted
    packet [9]. CR can range from 4/5 to 4/8. A larger CR offers more reliability
    by improving resilience to corrupted bits, but increases time on air and energy
    consumption [4]. 4) Transmission Power LoRa transmission power ranges from −4
    to 20 dBm. Higher transmission power causes an increase in energy consumption
    and signal-to-noise ratio. C. Fresnel Zone The concept of Fresnel zone clearance
    is used to account for interference by obstacles within the beam width of a radio
    signal. The first zone must be kept largely free from obstructions to avoid interfering
    with the radio reception. However, some obstruction of the Fresnel zones can often
    be tolerated. As a rule of thumb the maximum obstruction allowable is 40%, but
    the recommended obstruction is 20% or less [8]. SECTION III. Related Work Before
    LPWAN became a popular network infrastructure for agricultural IoT, mesh topology
    networks using smaller range network devices such as Zigbee dominated wireless
    sensor networks (WSN). However, this kind of implementation had a serious problem
    with limited link budget due to high data rates and a low link budget [15]. In
    contrast, LPWAN, using a star network topology, has a distinct advantage with
    longer range and battery life. There has been a significant amount of research
    on outdoor LoRa coverage and performance. Most were performed in urban and maritime
    environments. Urban experiments showed more than half of packets were successfully
    delivered from 5-10km range [1], and a maximum 80% of packet delivery at a distance
    of 2800 meters [11]. In maritime applications, performance of 15-30km distance
    was observed. However, unlike the prior mentioned research other research showed
    only a few hundred meter LoRa network coverage [5], [7]. Also, from these experiments
    LoRa showed distinct performance differences within various environments such
    as indoor, outdoor, underground or with large amounts of vegetation. Even meteorological
    conditions such as temperature and humidity affect network performance [11], and
    their impact on LoRa performance was observed in [5]. Research also showed variant
    hardware physical settings can have a great influence on LoRa network performance.
    With increasing spreading factor LoRa had longer range with higher reliability
    [11]. According to [7], BW was the largest factor in communication success. However,
    research by Cattani et al. [5] showed that spreading factor, coding rate and then
    bandwidth was the order that had the most effect on network reliability. It is
    important the transmitter and receiver use the same spreading factor and bandwidth
    combination for successful packet delivery [13], which means that to experiment
    on various PHY settings, each device has to have the same settings. LoRa radios
    with different coding rates can still communicate [5]. Although prior research
    showed expected performance of LoRa network in many areas, little work has been
    done on agricultural environments to evaluate LoRa performance. Since LoRa is
    an appropriate technology to apply in this environment, this paper focused on
    how PHY settings affect reliability and coverage on an actual tree farm. Vegetation
    can also be an obstacle to network performance, so it is expected that LoRa will
    have lower performance than in other previously researched environments. SECTION
    IV. Experiments Method and Results A. Hardware Setup We used the LoRa IoT Development
    Kit from ‘Dragino’ which is a company in China offering LoRa shield based on Semtech
    SX1276 chip as can be seen in Figure 1. It also offers the ‘LG01-P’ LoRa Gateway
    which is an open source single channel LoRa Gateway. The kit offers two portable
    devices equipped with an SX1276 radio module that works in the 915 MHz band, and
    a 1/2 wave omni-directional antenna. To find temperature and humidity data, a
    DHT11 sensor package was used; this is a composite sensor that contains a calibrated
    digital signal output to measure temperature and humidity. Fig. 1. Dragino IoT
    kit [6] Show All B. Experimental Setup 1) Sites Our experiments were performed
    three times at the same tree farm. The farm is located at 13455 S 525 W, Romney,
    IN 47981, USA. It is primarily a flat meadow, with small hills in the middle of
    the property. Mid-life maple, oak, and pine trees are planted in 8-foot separate
    rows on the property. 2) PHY Settings and Data Packet Table I Arduino node ID
    according to PHY settings The experiment was carried out by assigning an Arduino
    ID according to each PHY Setting. Table 1 shows these variant settings. Each three
    components of Arduino ID is spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate. SF can
    be set from 6 to 12. The SF is set to 7 (default), 9, and 11. The CR is set to
    a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 8. BW is set to 125kHz, aside from
    7-250-5 and 7-250-8. Only SF7 can be set to the maximum setting of 250kHz, so
    SF7 was set in two cases of 125kHz and 250kHz. The value of TX power was fixed
    at 13(default). To account for the 60% clear 1st Fresnel Zone at 200m, the devices
    and antennas were fixed 2.5m above the ground. In accordance with necessary settings,
    4 gateways were used to match both the LoRaWAn spreading factor and bandwidth.
    However, prior research showed LoRa shields with different coding rates can communicate
    with the same gateway. Therefore, both settings using same spreading factor and
    bandwidth but a different coding rate, sent data packets to one gateway. Table
    2 Data packet composition The data structures of the payload used in transmitted
    data packets is character type and were 9 bytes in size. The first three bytes
    make it possible to distinguish which device is sending data. We sent data at
    3 second intervals with a 0.5 second of delay between sensing. Each time, a gateway
    collected 150 data packets at once. The transceivers were set to not to retransmit
    lost data and thus accurately checked packet delivery rate. If the data packet
    wasn''t correct, this was considered a data loss and skipped. The next data packet
    was then examined. Every end-device was tested at 100m, 150m, and 200m. The first
    experiment was conducted on a day with a temperature of 25°C, and humidity of
    80%. The second day had a temperature 24°C, humidity of 62%. The third experiment
    was done with a temperature of 27°C, and humidity of 70%. Shields were put in
    a box to minimize meteorological factors affecting experiment results. Every experiment
    was carried out for about three hours. Additionally, all the experiments were
    performed at a height of 2.5m, considering Fresnel zone of LoRa network frequency
    and overall tree farm area. The result data was found through the average of the
    experiment results. Fig. 2. Experiment site (tree farm land). Star shows the position
    of AP and each flag shows the position of lora shields. Show All In addition,
    Fresnel zone tests were not done with different settings. LoRa Shield''s PHY setting
    conditions are set to default values. SF was set to 7, BW was set to 125, and
    CR was set to 5. The experiment was conducted under the same conditions with the
    change of height only at Om, 1m, 2m, and 3m at 200m. One hundred packets were
    used to determine tendency of performance improvement accordance with height.
    C. Metrics Upon this experiment''s completion, researchers calculated reliability
    and received signal strength indication (RSSI). The RSSI was used to analyze data
    of different settings at different distances. Reliability was calculated as the
    ratio of valid received packets to the number of packets transmitted to the Packet
    Delivery Ratio (PDR). The PDR provided information about the communication reliability
    [7]. RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal [10].
    PDR= D T (1) View Source D: Packets delivered successfully T: Total packets transmitted
    D. Experiment Results 1) Experiments with Different Phy Settings Table 3 Results
    of each setting at different distance Through Table 3 one can see that all settings
    but 7-125-5 and 7-250-5 showed more than 90% reliability at 150m. Only 9-125-8
    and 11-125-8 showed good reliability at 200m. Compared to related research, distances
    measured were much smaller than expected, and at least setting spreading factor
    to 9 and coding rate to 8 ensures 200m communication range with good reliability.
    As expected, PHY settings followed predictions. In most cases, settings with increased
    spreading factor and coding rate showed higher reliability at larger distances.
    Spreading factor clearly affected the readings. With higher spreading factor,
    LoRa communicated with higher reliability at larger distance. However, by combining
    spreading factor, PDR didn''t appear to linearly increase. Coding rate was impacted
    when the distance grew further away. With a smaller distance and reliable PDR
    (higher than 90%), changing coding rate increased PDR. Bandwidth had lowest impact
    on LoRa performance. As shown from bandwidth 125 KHz (7-125-5 and 7-125-8) and
    250 KHz (7-250-5 and 7-250-8) it was impossible to discover relation from configuring
    bandwidth. However, as seen in Figure 3, higher bandwidth impacted on RSSI as
    augmenting bandwidth has a negative connection between data rates and receiver
    sensitivity. Fig. 3. Average RSSI(dbm) according to distance(m). RSSI values are
    averaged by three experiments. Show All As Figure 4 shows, RSSI consistently decreased
    in every setting as distance grew further, unlike PDR. Even when PDR had erratic
    increase from 100m to 150m at spreading factor 7, RSSI showed a decrease. However,
    an obvious relation was not determined between RSSI and spreading factor. This
    correlates with other research [12]. Unlike Semtech''s claims, RSSI seems to be
    affected by distance, not spreading factor. 2) Fresnel Zone Experiment Fig. 5.
    PDR according to antenna height Show All Table 4 Results of fresnel zone experiment
    Using Figure 5 as reference, height impacted LoRa network. Performance in reliability
    surges along with antenna height from 0m to 2m. Considering that the Fresnel zone
    experiment only received 100 packets, the PDR data is different from the PHY setting
    experiment results. This shows the tendency of LoRa performance improvement with
    higher antenna placement. However, this experiment alone does not reveal the difference
    between 2m and 3m. Thus, it cannot be verified if the height increase beyond the
    Fresnel Zone ensures better communication. Further study needs to be done for
    clear explanation. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper provides a basis on deploying
    LoRa within a tree farm. To complement research on applying LoRa to agricultural
    IoT, this research has shown how PHY factors configurations and different distances
    impact reliability of LoRa on tree farm. Overall, LoRa communication range in
    tree farm is below expected values as specified commercially and in research.
    However, to secure high reliability in large distances, maintaining high spreading
    factor and coding rate is important. Spreading factor and coding rate affected
    LoRa performance in an expected way, but bandwidth did not conspicuously changed
    performance. RSSI showed a consistent pattern from different PHY factors configurations.
    Unlike inconsistent PDR changes in different PHY configurations and distances,
    RSSI decreased along with distances in every configuration. However, we cannot
    determine what effect, if any, the tree plantation had on LoRa network communication.
    In addition, this experiment not determine what effect complying with the calculated
    Fresnel Zone had on LoRa communication in regards to antenna height and distance
    between nodes. In the next paper, we plan to compare LoRa performance in open
    area and tree farm with the same PHY configurations to measure how the tree plantation
    affect the network performance. In future work, we will study other factors influencing
    LoRa performance such as antenna height and environmental factors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

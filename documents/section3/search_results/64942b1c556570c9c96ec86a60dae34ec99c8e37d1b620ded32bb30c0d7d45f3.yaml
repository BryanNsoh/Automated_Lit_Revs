  description: The quality of grapes and the drying process has a momentous impact
    on the quality of the final products (raisins). South Azerbaijan is the most important
    region for grape growing and raisin producing. However, the majority of the vineyards
    in the region are traditional, and the drying process is carried out in conventional
    structures that are not convenient. To increase the quality and productivity,
    it is necessary to modernize agricultural practices with reasonable cost suitable
    and affordable to traditional farming and farmers. To do this, the harsh environments
    and severe climate conditions of the vineyards and the drying buildings should
    be observed periodically to collect data. Wireless Sensor Networks are a key technology
    that can provide precise information, can update information, and can be a valuable
    resource to farmers to determine appropriate management practices. Using this
    technology, farmers can make real-time decisions such as scheduling irrigation
    periods, preventing diseases, choosing the right time for harvesting and so on.
    In this project, a Wireless Sensor Network system was designed and developed for
    remote real-time monitoring and collection of micrometeorological parameter data
    in three distant vineyards. The system was also used for monitoring the SO2 gas
    fumigation process and atmospheric parameters inside the drying structure. The
    system consists of a gateway and a series of peripheral wireless motes placed
    in the vineyards and inside the drying structure, which are equipped with agrometeorological
    sensors for environmental monitoring and for storing and transmitting data to
    the gateway. The gateway collects agrometeorological data and utilizes a wireless
    technology for data transmission and for communication between the motes and the
    central server (webpage). In addition, an on-line (real-time) warning system was
    embedded in the gateway to send alarm signals via SMS (Short Message Service).
    The devices were tested for software configuration functionality, hardware operation
    and data acquisition, energy consumption, and connectivity. Field experiment results
    demonstrated that the system represents a complete monitoring system, which provides
    efficient performance for developing information systems in precision viticulture.

    aggregation and integrationRaisinSouth Azerbaijan 1. Introduction According to
    the FAOSAT, Iran was the ninth largest grape producer in the world in 2012 (2150000
    MT). Additionally, in 2014 grape growing ranked second among horticultural products
    grown in Iran. The Azerbaijan provinces (South Azerbaijan) are the most important
    regions for grape growing in Iran, wherein more than 90% of the grape vineyards
    in these regions are traditional ones. Because of the cold weather and the environment
    of the region, the traditional vineyards are mainly in the form of large furrows.
    These specific furrows are called “Qana” in local Azerbaijani Turkish language
    and are a form of triangular prisms with a long base (approximately 25 × 22) two
    meters in height with a one-meter interval between every Qana (Fig. 1). Obviously,
    this particular kind of vineyard is not as productive as trellis ones, but they
    are more appropriate to the harsh environmental and climatic conditions of the
    region (extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers with −20 to 40 °C records).
    Additionally, the conversion of a traditional vineyard to a trellis one is costly
    and the majority of farmers cannot afford it, and so updates would require a nationally
    invested project. Instead, farmers could focus on utilizing suitable modern technologies
    to grow, tend, and monitor their vineyards to enhance efficiency and productivity.

    Fig. 1. The traditional vineyard (Qanas). Additionally, Iran is one of the largest
    raisin exporters in the world, ranking third (after Turkey and the USA) in the
    world and accounting for 27% of the world’s raisin exports. Compared to the other
    agricultural activities in the region, raisin producing has become of paramount
    importance for its economic values and for the size of the population involved
    in this kind of husbandry and commerce. Traditionally, raisins are produced naturally
    by sun-drying and hanging the grape bunches outdoor inside a structure (Karimi,
    2015), as shown in Fig. 2. Drying the grapes in shade (inside the building) can
    preserve their natural flavor and color. First, the grapes are pretreated by immersion
    in 2% K2CO3 solution for ruining the natural wax coating and subsequently for
    increasing the drying speed (Dobbs et al., 2014, Karimi et al., 2011). The grapes
    are also fumigated with SO2 gas to control postharvest gray mold rot (Botrytis)
    and other decay-causing fungi, to preserve the golden color of the raisins, to
    prevent the enzymatic browning, and to facilitate the drying process (Franck et
    al., 2005, Karimi et al., 2015, Das et al., 2009, Karimi et al., 2017). According
    to the Codex standards of golden bleached raisins, the maximum limit applicable
    for sulfur dioxide is 1500 ppm (62,400 µmol m−3). Since excessive sulfur dioxide
    fumigation is extremely dangerous to human health, the process should be closely
    monitored and controlled. Furthermore, as the grapes are dried in the shade, the
    drying process is sensitive and the drying grapes (raisins) can be spoiled and
    molded by excessive humidity. Hence, the humidity and temperature of the building
    should be monitored. Download : Download high-res image (667KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Drying structure. Additionally, pest and nuisance birds,
    insects, and animals can damage and depredate grape berries in vineyards, which
    can demolish the quality of grapes and raisins. By monitoring damage patterns
    and depredating species, it is possible to reduce damage or lower the cost of
    control by concentrating control methods in areas and seasons when damage is most
    severe. Precision Agriculture (PA) is one of the most modern and strategic farming
    systems that integrates information technology with management to increase long-term,
    site-specific, and whole-farm production efficiency and productivity. Precision
    Viticulture (PV) as a specific area of PA in vineyards being used to improve productivity
    and quality. Grape quality and yield depend on agricultural practices, climate
    and soil characteristics, pests, and environmental diseases. Accordingly, using
    these variables, PV can provide a management strategy to enhance grape and raisin
    quality. Generally, PV can simultaneously improve the yield and quality of grapes
    and their by-products. PV practices are performed based on acquiring, transmitting,
    and processing agglomerative data coming from a large-scale, heterogeneous sensor
    network. In recent years, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have been
    used efficiently to provide remote and real-time monitoring of high-quality production
    and processing systems. Therefore, WSNs can offer a more reliable and safe measuring
    process for grape and raisin production. By monitoring environmental conditions
    through ubiquitous devices called sensor nodes (or motes), a WSN connects the
    physical and computational world. These networks include a number of motes and
    one or more base stations. Usually, a base station with high processing and storing
    capacities is connected to many autonomous, cooperating, battery-powered, small-sized
    motes through wireless links and a gateway with the capability of gathering data
    from the motes. The motes integrate different sensors, from simple ones such as
    temperature, light, and humidity, to sophisticated ones including Global Positioning
    Systems, images, acoustic data, micro-radars, and so forth. In this manner, it
    is possible to monitor a wide range of environments to obtain precise online and
    real-time knowledge from the field. 2. Reasons and objectives of the project 2.1.
    Vineyard The quality of grapes is closely related to the quality of wine, raisin,
    grape syrup, vinegar, and other by-products. Therefore, a scientific understanding
    of viticulture and long-term monitoring of cultivation environment are required
    for smart viticulture management and, simultaneously, for increasing the quality
    of the by-products. In an attempt to monitor the cultivation environment, it is
    necessary to collect data at multiple locations in the vineyard for convenient
    cultivation management since field conditions such as soil moisture may vary even
    within the same vineyard (Togami et al., 2011). Furthermore, by monitoring the
    vineyard, it is possible to estimate, assess and understand the changes that occur
    in grape growing stages in order to determine irrigation, fertilizer, pesticide,
    and insecticide requirements, growth and ripening phases, and optimum points of
    harvesting as accurately as possible—in other words, to adequately predict various
    stages in grape production. For achieving these goals, it is necessary to collect
    as much information as possible on the water, soil, plants, and environment. PA
    is an important means for determining vineyard requirements and predicting growth
    stages of grapes by utilizing numerous technologies and infrastructures including
    data instrumentation and gathering systems, Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
    Global Positioning Systems (GPS), microelectronics, wireless technologies and
    so forth (López Riquelmea et al., 2009). There are many factors that affect the
    quality of grapes. Environmental variables such as temperature, solar irradiation,
    wind and moisture are the most important factors affecting grapevine phenology.
    Among them, temperature is the most important factor in vineyards. Other parameters
    should also be considered such as atmospheric humidity, soil humidity, and soil
    pH (Winkler, 1963). In general, environmental parameters can be detailed as follows.
    Temperature: One of the meteorological factors that can cause various damages
    to the vineyard including physiological damage or disorder, effects on the degree
    of maturity of the grape berries, frost/freeze damage resulting from low temperatures,
    fungi and diseases resulting from warm weather such as black rot, etc. The optimum
    temperature for fungal development during the growing season is 10–25 °C. The
    loss resulting from disease ranges from 5 to 80% depending on the amount of disease
    in the vineyard, weather, and cultivar susceptibility (Šrobárová and Kakalikova,
    2007). Humidity: An atmospheric parameter (present due to rain, dew, fog or irrigation)
    that is a major factor in fungal growth. Fungi caused by wet and dry weather include
    powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot. Additionally, excessive humidity
    can beget a dense canopy that will not only shade the fruits but also create a
    microclimate within the vineyard encouraging the spread of diseases. Furthermore,
    by measuring the environmental (and soil), humidity it is feasible to adjust the
    irrigation schedules. Soil Moisture: Water content or soil moisture is a result
    of a balance between water uptake (rainfall, precipitation, groundwater and irrigation)
    and water loss (seepage, evapotranspiration and drainage). Water stress can occur
    due to a lower moisture content in the soil. Furthermore, the lack of moisture
    during all seasons is responsible for slow development, low production, high sugar
    content, and a lack of acidity in wines. On the other hand, excessive moisture
    adversely affects the growth, productivity, and quality of grapes, and increases
    susceptibility to winter injury and disease. Soil pH: Improving the availability
    of mineral nutrients is one of the objectives in managing vineyard nutrient demand.
    Soil pH is a measure of soil acidity or alkalinity, which has a dramatic effect
    on the availability of several essential nutrients for grape growth. Soil pH levels
    that are too high or too low lead to a deficiency in many nutrients, a decline
    in microbial activity, a decrease in crop yield, and a deterioration of soil health.
    Low soil pH (pH 5.0 or lower) affects nutrient availability and root and shoot
    growth. Decreasing the soil pH from 5 to 3.5 results in increasing aluminum solubility
    so that the free and exchangeable aluminum ions affect nutrient availability and
    root growth. Additionally, a low pH prevents nitrogen cycling. High free aluminum
    precipitates phosphorus out of the soil solution and subsequently makes it unavailable
    to the plant. Exchangeable aluminum displaces calcium and magnesium, consequently
    decreasing their availability. Root growth is affected by aluminum toxicity, wherein
    it inhibits cell division in the root apical meristem. On the other hand, high
    pH soils present a different set of nutritional circumstances for grapevine roots.
    When soil pH increases from 5 to 8, aluminum insolubility removes it from the
    playing field. Accordingly, some of the phosphorus problems are obviated and the
    availability of calcium and magnesium is increased, but iron simultaneously precipitates
    out of the soil solution, limiting its availability. It is necessary to occasionally
    conduct soil tests to determine whether the soil pH has changed over time. Particularly,
    soils gradually acidify over time due to the removal of cations such as calcium,
    potassium, or magnesium either by leaching or uptake by plants, acid rain, or
    the reaction of certain nitrogen fertilizers in the soil (e.g., urea and ammonium
    nitrate). There are many other factors that can result in changing soil pH such
    as irrigation method, water quality, temperature, land use and management, the
    addition of nitrogen and sulfur fertilizers, etc. In warm, humid environments,
    soil pH decreases over time in a process called soil acidification due to leaching
    from high amounts of rainfall. In dry climates, however, soil weathering and leaching
    are less intense and pH can be neutral or alkaline. Hence, in order to prevent
    certain nutrient deficiencies, the soil pH should be approximately 5.5–6.5. Accordingly,
    the vines will not be debilitated and vulnerable to pest and disease attacks.
    Additionally, every year, the vines and grapes experience sequential growth cycles
    and phases so that every phase and stage has its own characteristics including
    the following: (1) Dormancy to Sprouting: In late January to early March the vines
    are awakened and pass the dormancy phase. During this change, the vines are pruned
    and begin to leak a colorless liquid, sometimes reddish; this is called the vine
    weeping phase. This phase usually lasts approximately three to four weeks. (2)
    Sprouting to Blooming: In April, when temperatures reach 10 °C, the sprouting
    phase begins. Buds swell and break, and initial small leaves appear. During this
    phase and during the subsequent blooming (flowering) phase, the vine is vulnerable
    to frost damage. During sprouting and flowering stages, water demand is low, so
    there are rarely water shortages. However, adequate moisture (water content) is
    required to promote bud break, root growth, shoot growth, and nutrient uptake.
    Water availability during the blooming stage is critical for continuous nutrient
    uptake, increasing fruitfulness, and potentially increasing berry size. (3) Blooming
    to Veraison: In late May, the blooming (flowering) phase occurs. The flowering
    consists of the flowers opening, resulting in fertilization. Lack of heat, excessive
    moisture, or lack of vigor of the plant can cause the flower to be incorrectly
    fecundated, and the grape bunches can have few berries (flowering shift). Adequate
    water during flowering can prevent a reduction in the potential harvest as a result
    of the reduced number of bunches. In July, the physiological maturity of the vine
    commences. The berries are still far from being mature grapes, but they have already
    started the ripening process. As August arrives, a phase called veraison (“Qora-Şirin”
    in the local spoken language) begins. In veraison, the berries’ greenish color
    changes to yellowish for white grapes and pinkish for red grape varieties. During
    the veraison phase, the acidity of the grapes decreases and the sugar amount is
    increased; sour berries become sugary, and their skin gradually softens. During
    the following growing seasons, the clusters are formed (after blooming), wherein
    adequate water is demanded. From fruit set to veraison, water is required for
    cell division, which determines berry size. Throughout this stage, the shoots,
    roots, and canopy are still growing, and the water demand is at its maximum level.
    Evapotranspiration values are also highest during this period and the volumes
    of replacing water can be high. This is the most crucial period to apply water.
    (4) Veraison to Harvest: During this stage, the maturation phase occurs. After
    veraison, a limited amount of water is preferable. Water is still required by
    the berries for cell expansion, but excessive moisture may promote shoot growth,
    hindering the vine’s acclimation process. Therefore, in order to achieve a balance
    between quality and productivity during the maturation phase, the amount of water
    has to be sufficient, but not too much. More importantly, during early September
    (before the harvest), the amount of sunlight and humidity between leaves and the
    soil surface (where the vines are lying down on the face of the Qana triangular
    prism) have the most striking effect on maturation and grape bunch plagues. Excessive
    sunlight can frazzle, scorch, and sear the grape berries. On the other hand, the
    humidity of this spatial zone beneath the leaves can result in plague and fungal
    diseases of the grape bunches, especially botrytis bunch rot (gray mold) and other
    fungal diseases such as black rot, sour rot, and downy mildew. Hence, in order
    to avoid such problems, the number of leaves has to be controlled by manually
    thinning the leaves or leaving them to remain. Near to harvest time from mid-September
    till mid-October, evapotranspiration values are much lower than earlier in the
    season, and root and shoot growth have essentially ceased. Hence, depending on
    the terrain characteristics (dry or wet), the grapes are ready to be harvested.
    It is extremely crucial to prioritize the harvesting operation according to the
    meteorological and geographical conditions of the vineyard. Importantly, uniform
    maturity is a factor that affects the quality of the raisin, and other by-products.
    The presence of hot or cold spots can result in variations in the degree of the
    fruit maturity. Moreover, the changes in the plant humidity throughout the entire
    growing season has a direct impact on the yield and grape quality. In case of
    water shortages and hot weather, the type of terrain is the most important factor
    that affects the vine moisture and grape maturity. The daily temperature profile
    is one of the most important environmental factors for grape quality, especially
    during the cold months and the month during the ripening phase. Real-time atmospheric
    temperature monitoring combined with historical data prediction could prevent
    frost effects. In the case of frost/freeze protection, monitoring air temperatures
    should be done throughout the vineyard, which is costly in terms of capital, labor,
    and operating costs. Additionally, the monitoring and analysis of humidity patterns
    for any phenological stage can also provide an effective way to avoid some crop
    pathogens, such as powdery mildew. Specifically, irrigation management is essential
    for high-quality grape production, and therefore it is necessary to measure soil
    moisture. Importantly, monitoring soil pH from blooming to veraison can notably
    provide conducive information about applying fertilizer to the vineyard. The WSN
    and PV technologies enable farmers to track the vineyard’s condition and progression.
    It is possible to compose an information database and use the data to support
    specific decisions and actions. Real-time data from a sensor network deployed
    in the field can be used by experts to make decisions such as the irrigation policy,
    to locate the spots of vineyards exposed to excessive sunlight, or to take the
    desired actions at the time when fungus or grape plagues are detected. Furthermore,
    WSN technology has other notable benefits such as being non-intrusive (with little
    to no human intervention) and being available for inexpensive prices. Additionally,
    because of some geographical factors such as the orientation and slope of the
    landscape, it is possible for vineyards located at different distances to have
    considerably different temperatures, humidity, etc. Thus, monitoring spatial variability
    of the conditions affecting the grapes can be feasible by deploying the appropriate
    sensor network. Lastly, WSN technology can be applied in vineyards to detect nuisance
    insects. In recent years, the region’s vineyards are suffering mainly from two
    kinds of insects, the cicada and the cricket. These insects damage grapevines
    primarily through their ovipositional activities such that vine growth is being
    affected adversely and severely. Cicadas especially have broken out, and the trees
    have been overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the females laying their eggs in
    the shoots. Small trees have wilted and larger trees have lost small branches
    in some vineyards. These insects spend 17 years underground before crawling from
    the soil in late May and early June and immediately shedding their last immature
    skin to begin life as an adult. They immediately begin to sing, which they do
    incessantly from dawn to dusk. Their pathogenic existence and damage are concurrent
    with their strident singing sound (acoustic signals). By applying a WSN with its
    sensor nodes configured to sample audio signals and recording the sounds, it is
    possible to detect insects from their surrounding environment. 2.2. Drying building
    2.2.1. Drying process Generally, the processing and environmental data acquisition
    inside the drying buildings can be performed manually, visually, and occasionally,
    or it can be carried out using wired systems that are normally expensive and not
    flexible. Additionally, in regard to security and accessibility, these solutions
    are not secure or appropriate since it is necessary to hire workers to take measurements
    inside the fumigated and dangerously polluted environment and far inaccessible
    sections of the building. Uniform environmental conditions inside the building
    are required in order to maintain a high drying quality and, consequently, to
    produce raisins with higher quality. Thus, farmers must stay informed of the environmental
    factors and conditions inside the building such as humidity and temperature during
    the several weeks of the drying process. Therefore, the grape drying process inside
    the building can be monitored more easily and comfortably by deploying WSN technology
    and tools. 2.2.2. Fumigation process As was mentioned, the fumigation process
    is extremely sensitive and hazardous. If the fumigated amount of SO2 (dioxide
    sulfur) is low, the process will be useless and futile. On the other hand, excessive
    fumigation can ruin and vitiate the berries. Meanwhile, visually or manually monitoring
    the process is extremely dangerous to the workers’ health. Here, remote monitoring
    is the best solution. Consequently, by implementing WSNs the visual monitoring
    issue can be obviated without further ado. 3. Relevant research review In recent
    decades, there have been many different investigations using and implementing
    WSNs in various crop production applications. In regard to precision horticulture,
    López Riquelmea et al. (2009) presented the topology of a deployed network using
    four types of nodes (Soil Mote, Environmental Mote, Water Mote and Gateway Mote)
    to measure various soil properties such as temperature, volumetric moisture content,
    and salinity. The system was successful for the ecological monitoring of cabbage
    crop for the entire growing season with the required precision. Hwang et al. (2010)
    proposed an agricultural environment monitoring server system for monitoring information
    of an outdoor agricultural production environment utilizing wireless sensor network
    (WSN) technology. The proposed server system collected environmental and soil
    information outdoors through WSN-based environmental and soil sensors. Garcia-Sanchez
    et al. (2011), deployed WSNs in order to integrate video-surveillance and data-monitoring
    over distributed crops. They developed wireless node prototypes providing agriculture
    data monitoring, motion detection, camera sensors and long-distance data transmission.
    In another study, Jiang et al. (2013) reported an application of a web-based remote
    agro-ecological monitoring system for observing spatial distribution and dynamics
    of Bactrocera dorsalis (phytophagous insects) in fruit orchards. To achieve real-time
    system management and data inquiry, a remote control interface and a web-based
    decision support program was implemented to allow system administrators and users
    to remotely access the monitoring report of their farms via the internet from
    virtually anywhere. Srbinovska et al. (2015) carried out a research project on
    environmental parameter monitoring using wireless sensor networks, which was deployed
    in a pepper vegetable greenhouse. Their presented WSN system consisted of sensor
    nodes and a base station, which was used for measurement and data collection of
    parameters such as temperature, humidity, and illumination. Moreover, other studies
    have been conducted applying WSN technologies in agricultural services such as
    soil water content sensing (Pan et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2014), crop disease
    risk evaluation (Das et al., 2009, Rossi et al., 2010), fertilization, pesticide
    spraying (Santos et al., 2014), crop temperature sensing (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2013), remote sensing and control of an irrigation system (Kim et al., 2008),
    autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation (Goumopoulos et al., 2014) and
    valve control (Coates et al., 2013, Dobbs et al., 2014), automated irrigation
    management based on the water content and temperature of soil, humidity, temperature,
    wind speed, and irradiance (Nikolidakis et al., 2015), and frost protection and
    dew condensation prevention (Park and Park, 2011, Pierce and Elliott, 2008). Specifically,
    for a precision viticulture (PV) application, researchers have conducted outstanding
    projects using WSNs. Burrell et al. (2004) presented a study on the potential
    use of sensor networks to aid work in vineyards. They described a variety of sensor
    network configurations and applications that can address different priorities
    of the vineyard. Beckwith et al. (2004) implemented a 65-node multi-hop WSN in
    a vineyard for six months. The collected information was used for addressing two
    important parameters of heat summation and potential frost damage in wine production.
    Morais et al. (2008) used a ZigBee multi-powered wireless acquisition device for
    remote sensing applications in PV. They designed a platform for that purpose called
    MPWiNodeZ, as a ZigBeeTM network element that provides a mesh-type array of acquisition
    devices for vineyards. Shah et al. (2009) designed a PV framework in the vineyards
    at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. They deployed wireless sensor nodes equipped with
    soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and leaf wetness sensors.
    Data collected by the sensors were wirelessly transferred in a multi-hop manner
    to a base station node (approximately 700 m away from the mote) connected with
    an embedded gateway for data logging and correlation. The embedded gateway base
    station performed elementary data aggregation and filtering algorithms and transmitted
    the sensory data to an agri-information server via GPRS. Additionally, Matese
    et al. (2009), designed a remote real-time system for monitoring and collecting
    micrometeorological parameters in a vineyard. The system comprised a base agro-meteorological
    station (Master Unit) and a series of peripheral wireless nodes (Slave Units)
    located in the vineyard. In this project, the Master Unit stored all of the Slave
    Unit data and, using a GSM/GPRS device, sent all the collected data to a remote
    central server. In 2011, an autonomous intelligent gateway infrastructure for
    in-field processing in precision viticulture was designed and installed in a vineyard.
    The infrastructure, named iPAGAT (Intelligent Precision Agriculture Gateway),
    ran an aggregation engine that fills a local database with environmental data
    gathered by ZigBee WSNs and it possessed embedded communication capabilities such
    as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, GPRS (for accessing both gateway and remote data by
    local and remote users), and the internet, and it ran site-specific management
    tools using authenticated smartphones (Peres et al., 2011). Accordingly, Fernandes
    et al. (2013) utilized this infrastructure (iPAGAT) and introduced a framework
    for WSN management for PV and agriculture based on IEEE 1451 standard. The framework
    consisted of a ZigBee end device (sMPWiNodeZ), an IEEE 1451 WTIM (Wireless Transducer
    Interface Module), and an IEEE 1451 NCAP (Network Capable Application Processor)
    that acts as a gateway to an information service provider, and a WSN coordinator.
    More recently, Reiser et al. (2017) designed and utilized a small 4-wheel autonomous
    robot that assembled the data from nodes distributed in a vineyard in order to
    overcome the limited transmission range of spatially separated nodes of a wireless
    sensor network (WSN). The current innovative systems and projects applying WSN
    technology to vineyards have their own merits for solving the multiple challenges
    existing in the modern vineyards. However, there are some factors that should
    be considered, improved, and ameliorated such as • Cost: The existing research
    and development state for selecting and implementing the components are considerably
    expensive. Specifically, in the traditional and deprived regions such as South
    Azerbaijan (wherein the devices are imported from foreign countries), the devices
    are not affordable to the end-users. For applications in such regions, reducing
    the system cost is utterly urgent. Thus, a low-cost application design is extremely
    necessary for selecting and implementing sensor nodes and hardware. • Energy-efficiency:
    In any WSN-based system, energy management is one of the most challenging issues.
    The amount of energy consumed by sensor nodes can be reduced by reducing the amount
    of communication in the network. This can be done by designing different system
    components and algorithms, or alternatively, by considering other potential energy
    harvesting solutions such as solar power, wind power, biomass, vibrations, power
    banks, and so on. • Complication: The hardware components and designed platforms
    used in the proposed WSN systems are sophisticated and therefore should be simplified
    and easy to use. In this manner, in order to ensure ease of operation for the
    end-users who are typically farmers and non-technical persons, human–computer
    interaction issues such as accessibility and usability should be considered in
    designing and developing the system’s architecture. • Traditional vineyard issues:
    Unlike in developed countries, the traditional vineyards in the region are partitioned,
    smaller, and personalized farming lands. Additionally, the structure of the vineyards
    is completely different from the modernized trellis ones. Thus, a specific and
    suitable deployment architecture is needed. • Raisin quality: Virtually all of
    the existing research projects are concerned with grape and wine quality only.
    However, the characteristics of grapes (such as sugar level, alcohol level, acidity,
    etc.) that are grown for wine are completely different from the grapes that are
    produced for raisins. To our knowledge, there is not any research on traditional
    vineyards and grape drying (raisin producing) structures. The aim of this research
    is to integrate and equip the traditional vineyards with simple and easily used
    architecture, low-cost devices, and low powered components, which are more felicitous
    and tailored to the need of the region’s farmers. 4. Materials and methods In
    this section, the implementation of the proposed system is described. First, the
    hardware-software design of the system, the communication protocols, and the topology
    of the system are presented. Finally, the energy issues and implementation details
    are explained. 4.1. Architecture design The hardware architecture of the system
    resembles the Master/Slave configuration (Fig. 3). The Slave Unit (SU) is composed
    of a series of wireless motes located in the various locations of the vineyard
    with their sensors for monitoring meteorological and environmental parameters.
    The SU utilizes wireless technology to communicate and transmit the data to the
    Master Unit (MU). The MU is a base station, i.e., the gateway, which collects
    data from the entire vineyard, and then stores and processes them. Additionally,
    the web page designed as the management software for the transmission function
    is used to provide a connection between the operator and the gateway. Other software
    is used for designing the database and hardware programming and is detailed in
    the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (367KB) Download :

    4.1.1. Hardware architecture 4.1.1.1. End devices (Motes) Each End Device (ED),
    or mote consists of one or more sensor and module inputs. Motes are composed of
    a processor, a radio module, a power supply and one or more sensors mounted on
    the mote itself or connected to it (López Riquelmea et al., 2009). The gateway
    sends a data reading request to the end device and consequently, the end device
    responds with the value from the sensors. The ED consists of two interface parts:
    the sensor and the wireless communication interfaces. The interfaces are imbedded
    in Arduino Board and are included as a sensor shield and nRF24L01 module for sensing
    and sending the data, respectively, so that the sensor interface receives the
    data from the sensors and sends it to the gateway via the wireless communication
    interface (nRF24L01 module). Therefore, the end device’s components are Arduino
    boards, modules, and sensors: Arduino Board: Arduino is an open-source project
    that creates microcontroller-based kits in order to build digital devices and
    interactive objects, whereby they sense and control physical devices. The main
    component of an Arduino board is an Atmel 8-, 16- or 32-bit AVR microcontroller
    with other synchronized components that provide programming and collaboration
    with other circuits. The Arduino project provides a cross-platform application
    written in the Java programming language, named Arduino’s integrated development
    environment (IDE). IDE is a programming environment in which the codes (sketches)
    are written, compiled and uploaded into the embedded microcontroller. The Arduino
    series that was used in this project was the Arduino Uno, Nano, and Micro, which
    are based on the ATmega328P and ATmega32U4 microcontrollers’ board. Modules: Various
    sensor modules are connected to a mote (ED) in order to acquire the data and transmit
    them wirelessly to the base station (gateway), where the data are stored. The
    modules utilized in this work include nRF24L01 module, VS1003 acoustic module,
    GSM module, and U-blox NEO-6M module (GPS receivers). Sensors: To monitor and
    acquire real-time data from the field, multiple types of sensors were integrated
    into the data acquisition network such as DHT11 digital temperature and humidity
    sensor, TGS 813 sensor for SO2 gas, PIR motion sensor, soil pH sensor, and EC-5
    soil moisture sensor. 4.1.1.2. Gateway architecture An Intel Atom processor with
    a 1.83 GHz has been used as the motherboard of the gateway (Fig. 3). This mini
    motherboard works with x86 architecture, wherein it supports all the software
    that can be installed on the real windows. Its size is 10 × 10 cm and it has 2G
    RAM and 32G eMMc. Other features of the device have been detailed in Table 1.

    Yes LAN 10/100 Mb Video Output HDMI Port 4xUSB2.0 Operating system Windows 10
    Dimensions (10 cm × 10 cm) Power 5 V 3 A The Mini PC is connected to the peripheral
    motes through the receiver circuit. The receiver circuit’s components include
    Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano and Micro, a GSM module, an NRF24L01 receiver module,
    a power supply, M2596 (regulator), an external sound card, and antennas. The gateway
    is the heart of the proposed system, and it runs all the management operations
    such as managing the received and transmitted data, optimizing the energy consumption
    in the motes, pooling the motes, and managing the alarms. The gateway consumes
    a 5 V–2 A energy source, and it uses mains electricity. However, two rechargeable
    batteries are also used in the case of emergencies. To manage the limited energy
    capabilities and consequently prevent the system’s shutdown, a “pooling” technique
    was ingrained into the gateway architecture. Pooling is one of these methods,
    which functions based on an on-demand approach. In the continuous approach, the
    motes send the data periodically according to the defined amount of time, without
    any management techniques. In this form of operation, the motes are working in
    continuous mode and, since the maximum amount of energy is consumed by the receiver
    and transmitter modules, the energy consumption and lifetime of the network are
    affected. However, the system can be designed based on on-demand measurements,
    as well. In this method, the gateway inspects the mote data in order to shift
    their sleeping mode to the active mode and actuates them to send their data to
    the gateway and then return to the sleeping mode. Additionally, the time of the
    inspection operation can be adjusted according to the different seasons and conditions.
    For example, inspection can be done in minute, hourly, or daily rates instead
    of every 250 ms. Accordingly, the energy-efficiency and performance of the system
    can be optimized. In general, the gateway functions as the sink node of the WSN
    system, whereby the gateway’s Mini PC is connected to the sink motes (via the
    receiver circuit) and monitoring center (Fig. 3). The gateway also executes other
    duties such as data aggregation, real-time warning system, web access with Ethernet
    cable and Wi-Fi, network management, and environmental data resource. 4.1.2. Software
    design In this section, all the software specifications that were used in this
    project are described. In Fig. 4, the flowchart of the end device and the gateway
    function is presented. Furthermore, the functional description of the software
    architecture of the gateway and the motes (end devices) is presented in Fig. 5.

    The functional description of the gateway’s software architecture and the peripheral
    motes. Software specifications include the following: (a) Microcontroller: The
    Arduino IDE was used as a code editor and code burner. By connecting to the Arduino
    hardware, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment – or Arduino Software) makes
    it feasible to upload programs and communicate with them. (b) Web-Server: A simple
    HTML/AJAX running on the gateway was used in this work. Using AJAX, web pages
    can be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the
    scenes. In other words, updating parts of a web page can be executed without reloading
    the entire page. The XAMPP application was used for the web server, which is comprised
    chiefly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interoperates for scripts
    written in the PHP programming language. (c) On-line warning system: The warning
    system is a software that is installed within the overall system. The online warning
    system designed for the project is a system based on a webpage, which works according
    to the defined threshold of parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil pH,
    soil moisture, motion, and gas concentration level. The codes were written in
    Brackets IDE with HTML and JavaScript. In this system, an alarm is sent to the
    operator via the webpage. Accordingly, the operator (farmer or manager) will manually
    or automatically take appropriate actions in order to obviate the problems. Additionally,
    the system stores the alarms in the database, and by using the designated lights
    on the webpage, warns the operator. Furthermore, the proposed system is able to
    send these alarms to the operator via SMS. To perform this kind of communication
    and connectivity, a SIM900A module was used on the gateway board. SIM900A module
    is a simple Arduino GSM module for sending SMS. The module supports communication
    in a 900 MHz band. Programming of this module, like other modules such as nRF24L01,
    is performed in Arduino IDE. Hence, the online warning system alarms the operator
    via SMS and the webpage. The system generates alarm signals in order to warn of
    probable frost, likely disease, irrigation schedule, pH abnormality, an anomaly
    in fumigation and drying processes, and motion changes. The online warning system
    checks the data from the gateway in order to compare the sensor readings stored
    in the database with the limits defined by the minimum and maximum amounts of
    parameters for every measured condition such as frost, excessive fumigation and
    so forth. While the evaluated parameters are exceeded or declined, a signal (alarm)
    is sent by the system to the operator via SMS and the webpage. For instance, if
    the air humidity reaches 95% and air temperature decreases to 3 °C, an automatic
    alarm is generated and sent via SMS and webpage. The operating rule codes are
    uploaded to the gateway, which contains the defined threshold values of the parameters
    that are used by the online warning system in order to send the alarms. For example,
    the “frost Prediction” alarm can be scripted as the following schematic algorithm
    (rule): If (Day > 80 && Day < 120) {  if (Temp < 3 && Hum > 95)   {   char number
    [ ] = “0914∗∗∗∗∗∗”;   char message [40] = “Frost Prediction”;   sms.SendSMS (number,
    message);  } } (d) Database: MySQL programming language was used to run on the
    client computer. The software architecture of the gateway is constructed as a
    relational database management system. Similar to the hardware and software of
    this system, the database architecture has been designed more simply. Fig. 6 shows
    the structure of the designed database as part of the employed software. The database
    system functions in a real-time manner. While the system operates based on the
    continuous mode, the system receives real-time data (every 250 ms) and stores
    them in the relevant tables in the database. However, in the on-demand mode, the
    system receives data according to the operator’s request. While the data are stored
    in tables, their values are relationally compared with the threshold values of
    the warning conditions, which are specified in the alarm table. Therefore, once
    each condition occurs, the system informs the operator by means of the provided
    methods (SMS or webpage). In Fig. 7 the functional flowchart of the overall system
    is depicted. Download : Download high-res image (549KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the overall system. 4.1.3. Connectivity capabilities In this project, the nRF24L01
    module was used for communication and transmitting data between the EDs (motes),
    sink motes, and the gateway (base sink). The standard SPI protocol and pins (CSN,
    SCK, MOSI, MISO), with the additional CE (for controlling the RX/TX and standby
    modes) and IRQ signals (for informing the SPI master about the completion of a
    packet reception/transmission) are used by this chip. To ensure a smooth data
    flow between the radio front end and the system’s MCU (Master Control Unit) or
    the gateway, internal FIFO manages the data flow. Furthermore, communication between
    the gateway and the monitoring center is executed with Ethernet cable and Wi-Fi.
    Communicational protocols used in this proposed monitoring system consist of the
    two following categories (Fig. 8): (1) The connection between the sink motes (of
    the EDs), the receiver circuit, and the Mini PC of the gateway: This connection
    between the sink motes of the EDs, and between sink motes and the receiver circuit,
    is performed based on SPI protocol. Using this protocol, it is possible to manage
    hardware-software properties (such as baud rate, bit rate, configuration register,
    etc.), to synchronize all EDs, sink motes (N1, N6, and N11 motes), and the gateway
    and to ensure receipt of the data (ack or nack). Moreover, the connection between
    the receiver circuit and the Mini PC of the gateway is performed using USB protocol.
    The USB is also a power resource for modules and Arduino boards. The C# coding
    language was used for port scanning functions, whereby the Mini PC scans the data
    (received by the receiver circuit), puts them in the variables, and does the following
    operations: (a) using an Ethernet interface (or Wi-Fi), sends the data to the
    monitoring center and (b) stores the data in the database in order to access them
    as it is needed. (2) The mechanisms and protocols between the gateway and monitoring
    center: Ethernet port (using the network cable) and Wi-Fi were used for this kind
    of connectivity in order to enable the users to access the gateway. In addition,
    SMS sending and Bluetooth link capabilities are provided. Furthermore, the data
    aggregation task is performed simply and robustly. The gateway receives the EDs’
    transmitted data and stores them in the database and the relevant tables. Download

    how the devices are interconnected. A star topology was used in this investigation.
    In this kind of topology, the gateway functions as a central processing unit so
    that it gathers sensor readings from all EDs. In a star topology, every sink mote
    is connected to a central node (gateway or MCU), which acts as a channel to transmit
    messages. 4.2. Energy Sensing, computation, and radio operations such as receiving
    and transmitting are three types of activities that consume the majority of the
    power in a mote. Since radio operation activity uses the majority of the power,
    an energy efficient plot should be concentrated on decreasing the amount of time
    devoted to receiving and transmitting operations. The power consumption of a mote’s
    receiving activity is higher than the transmitting activity. There are two modes
    of receiving and transmitting, wherein each mode has a different energy consumption
    level and has a direct effect on the network’s durability. (1) Continuous mode:
    In this method, the motes continuously send the data, and they have to be active
    and respond to the gateway’s requests. Obviously, in this mode, the lifetime of
    the motes and network will be decreased. (2) On-demand mode: During this mode,
    the motes are in the sleep condition. When the motes receive a request from the
    gateway they turn on and, having responded to the request, they return to the
    sleep mode. Accordingly, the network traffic is reduced because of the decrease
    in the sampling frequency. Hence, this mode has less energy consumption than the
    continuous mode, and the network’s lifetime is increased. Since the energy consumption
    in the WSN is the most challenging issue and the battery is a more common source
    of energy, using the best mode for optimizing consumption of energy is inevitable.
    4.3. Stipulation and deployment Before installing the system in the harsh and
    natural conditions of the vineyards, the system was tested under laboratory conditions
    between December 2015 and February 2016, in order to assay the accuracy and channel
    resolution of the motes and gateway boards. Subsequently, all the hardware were
    calibrated according to their data sheets and installed in the WSN. All the executable
    codes were manually downloaded into the associated microcontrollers of the motes.
    A unique identifier was attributed to each mote. Both the source and binary codes
    were checked in order to detect and correct faults and errors. The energy source
    for the motes was provided in two methods and every method was evaluated and tested.
    For the EDs, two means of energy supply were used and tested: (1) rechargeable
    common batteries and (2) rechargeable lithium batteries. Since the power bank
    was utilized in the second method, the system was able to have an approximately
    one-month duration. However, for the gateway, DC power was used. Since the gateway
    had access to unlimited electricity, it was able to work permanently. To create
    wireless connectivity, nRF24L01 was used. This module can transfer data in a 1600 m
    distance range and has “auto ack” capability, which provides certainty in receiving
    the data. For testing this module, one thread of data was sent 1000 m from the
    transmitter and on the other end, the data was received correctly without errors.
    Finally, by adding this module to the project’s board, the data were received
    singularly and wholly. Accordingly, the sensor motes were physically located in
    the fields. 4.3.1. Vineyards Having carried out the tests, the system components
    were implemented in the vineyards. Three disparate and distant experimental vineyards
    were used in the project (Fig. 9). The climates of these three vineyards were
    different. The climate of the first vineyard, named Yovşanlıq, is dry, the second
    vineyard (Mıncıqlı sector) is a medium climate, and the third one (Minə) is semi-humid.
    The cultivated grapes of the vineyards were white and red Thompson seedless grapes.
    However, the majority of the grapes were white (more than 98%). The area of the
    Minə, Mıncıqlı, and Yovşanlıq vineyards is 130 × 138 m2, 130 × 141 m2, and 210 × 132 m2,
    respectively. The vine trees in every vineyard were pruned during the spring.
    As is shown in Table 2, five motes were implemented in each the Minə and Mıncıqlı
    vineyards, and seven motes in the Yovşanlıq vineyard were in the desired spots
    (totally 17 motes). To protect the motes from rain and environmental damages,
    a package was designed to plug in the mote’s components. The motes were fastened
    to a bar with the height of 0.5 m to keep soil sensors close to both the ground
    and vines. The gateway was placed outside the vineyard in the monitoring site
    in order to evaluate the system’s performance in term of range, robustness, and
    flexibility and to assess the microclimatic variability corresponding to the management
    practices within the various areas. Download : Download high-res image (279KB)

    4.3.2. Drying building Thirteen motes were installed within the drying building,
    with three of them being used for the fumigation process and the remaining ten
    motes used for the drying process. For the fumigation process, just one sensor
    was used (SO2 gas sensor), but for the drying process, two sensors including humidity
    and temperature were utilized. Once the field tests, installation, and implementation
    processes were completed, the motes were activated and the WSN system was initiated.
    The data from each mote were received by the gateway (base station). Subsequently,
    the data were stored in a database in order to be processed and depicted in the
    web page. The updated data obtained from the vineyards were extracted and presented
    by the web page. The operator or vineyard owner exploits the provided information
    to make the right decisions and takes appropriate actions to handle and manage
    the problems and issues relevant to the vineyards. All the data received from
    the motes were stored in textual files in the database and were presented in the
    webpage in the monitoring center. This webpage is the software of the monitoring
    system, which is used for management. Storing the data in a text file in the database
    makes it possible to create graphs of hourly, daily or longer interval data reports
    and trends to analyze the environmental variables. 5. Experimental results and
    discussions The designed system was user-friend and easy to use. The web page
    (Fig. 10, Fig. 11) provided the following main functions: real-time data, historical
    data, mote management, and user management. The user can observe the data from
    each sensor of the motes in real-time and access the historical data by selecting
    the time range for acquiring the data with a simple point-and-click. In addition,
    the mote management functions allow the user to check the status of the network
    and actual motes. By using this option, the user can check the condition of each
    mote in order to replace batteries or to troubleshoot the technical faults and
    re-deploy the troubled motes. The user can reach to every mote and observe each
    sensors’ data by means of the displayed charts and numerical presentations. Moreover,
    a user carrying smart devices such as a smartphone, tablet, or PDA (via SMS and
    Wi-Fi) can monitor the state of the field and the in situ sensors. Download :

    motes can be done without further change or expense. Compared to the other proposed
    systems, changing the hardware-software architecture of the current system is
    not costly because it is not necessary to upgrade hardware boards or to change
    their programming logics. The gateway, despite having lower software-hardware
    complications, was able to operate all the desired functions and tasks in the
    traditional vineyards, and it monitored the defined warning conditions accurately.
    Furthermore, using a Mini PC as the motherboard of the gateway obviated traditional
    systems’ limitations. One of the conventional methods of designing a gateway board
    is to utilize an Ethernet shield or the RS232 connector, which has some disadvantages.
    For example, an Ethernet shield has a lower speed, uses an SD card for saving
    the data and is limited in connection methods to the monitoring center. By using
    the Mini PC, these limitations were eliminated. Particularly, using the Mini PC
    in the proposed system was beneficial for enhancing the connection and communication
    capabilities and performance speed, reducing the SDOF (Single Point Of Failure)
    malfunction potentiality (by installing the security software), being used as
    the monitoring center (because of having of the HDMI interface), having remote
    access desktop capability (using remote access software tools such as TightVNC
    and so on), installing various desired software (due to possessing the Windows
    operating system), and getting access to the database comfortably and speedily.
    Additionally, the operating system of the Mini PC is flexible and easily usable.
    Its OS toolsets are easily extensible to user’s specific needs. Moreover, the
    communication stack in the default libraries has the considerable characteristics
    of usability, simplicity and resource efficiency so that the users can use it
    without extra complexity. External memory support for user data storage in the
    Mini PC is provided. The users do not have to worry about sensor data—they are
    depicted automatically. Finally, all the required software can be installed easily.
    The tests pertaining to the energy consumption indicated that using common batteries
    makes the motes stable for one week. However, as shown in Fig. 12, by using an
    on-demand approach, the energy consumption of the batteries was decreased and
    their lifetime was increased. Fig. 12 shows a typical daily and weekly energy
    consumption of the utilized batteries with the continuous mode vs. the same application
    using the on-demand mode. As depicted in the figure, in comparison with the continuous
    mode, the lifetime of the system was increased by 43.75% using the power source
    with the on-demand mode. Additionally, when utilizing the power bank facilities,
    the lifetime of the batteries increased to one month. During continuous weeks
    of monitoring, every battery’s condition was monitored by the operator using the
    webpage in order to recharge or replace the weak batteries. Download : Download

    nRF24L01 modules were easily able to perform data transference with a 1600 m distance
    range. In addition, instead of using overpriced boards, these low-cost modules
    were utilized, and by modifying and changing their baud-rates and registers, it
    was possible to provide the modules’ performance analogous to the costly ones.
    The results of the vineyards and drying process monitoring are detailed below.
    5.1. Vineyards The developed system was deployed in three vineyards located in
    Qurijan (Qurucan) village in South Azerbaijan. The system was used from March
    to November 2016. The farmers were using traditional irrigation methods within
    the vineyards. The prime objective of utilizing this technology was to provide
    predictive information about the gardens in order to improve the quality of the
    grapes and raisins. The measured parameters were humidity, soil pH and moisture,
    movement detection, GPS, and temperature. Data acquisition processes were mainly
    divided into the following seasons: (1) Spring (lasting from March to June): During
    April, temperature and air humidity sensors were simultaneously activated in order
    to monitor variations in temperature and predict the frost. The sensors were demanded
    to monitor nocturnal and diurnal variation of the temperature and humidity from
    20o’clock until 8o’clock in the morning (of the next day). Fig. 13 depicts two
    typical nightly and daily variation of the temperature and humidity in the vineyards.
    Three motes were selected from each vineyard (N2, N7, and N12 motes). It was observed
    that the hours near to dawn (between 4 and 6o’clock) are the hours most at risk
    of frost damage. This means that during these hour intervals, the vineyards are
    extremely susceptible to frost harm, which resulted from “radiation freezes”.
    Radiation freezes occur on calm, clear nights (without any clouds) when the heat
    from the ground radiates upward. Since the cold air is heavier than the warm air,
    it settles in areas of lower elevation. As the cold air stays low and the warm
    air rises, the air becomes stratified and a temperature inversion forms. Additionally,
    as seen in Fig. 13, before the break of dawn, the air humidity reaches its maximum
    range in the vineyards. Simultaneously, an increase in air humidity and a reduction
    in temperature can precipitate frost occurrence. The data from the sensors showed
    that Minə vineyard was the most vulnerable vineyard to the frost harm. Hence,
    it was suggested that the farmer install and apply frost protection equipment
    and methods during April (of every year) within the vineyards. Download : Download

    nightly and daily variations in temperature and humidity in the vineyards. During
    this season, other sensors including humidity, PIR, GPS, and acoustic modules
    were active. A GPS sensor was installed on just one end device of every vineyard
    (N1, N6, and N11). The PIR sensor was utilized to protect the implemented end
    devices from intruders such as wild animals. During the season, no intruders were
    observed. Additionally, the acoustic modules were activated during May in order
    to record the sounds of depredating insects. During this month, the acoustic modules
    were activated daily around lunchtime. In Yovşanlıq vineyard, cricket songs were
    detected. Accordingly, insecticides were deployed to the vineyard in order to
    extirpate the nuisance insects. Furthermore, during this season, the pH sensors
    were turned on weekly in order to record soil pH variations. (2) Summer (June
    to September): During this season, soil pH, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
    sensors were active. Concurrently, acoustic modules were actively used. During
    these consecutive months, soil moisture records provided updated data in order
    to irrigate the vineyards. As shown in Fig. 14, continuous monitoring of the soil
    moisture level provided the data for scheduling irrigation times within each vineyard.
    The peak points in every linear graph indicate the times that the vineyards were
    irrigated. Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards were irrigated five times, but the Yovşanlıq
    vineyard was irrigated six times. The data indicate that because of the dry climate,
    water evaporation speed within Yovşanlıq vineyard is greater than in the other
    two vineyards. However, it is possible to accumulate and save moisture content
    by increasing irrigation duration and frequency. In addition, it was observed
    that while the irrigation duration increases, the moisture content also increases.
    This correlation demonstrates that longer irrigation times lead to the deeper
    penetration of water and higher moisture content. Download : Download high-res

    of the soil moisture and soil pH. In addition, during early June it was observed
    that the soil pH of Mıncıqlı was trending towards alkalinity (Fig. 14). To lower
    the pH to 6.5 and 6, a urea fertilizer was used in the vineyard. As depicted in
    Fig. 14, applying a urea fertilizer had a significant effect on maintaining the
    desired soil pH level in Mıncıqlı vineyard. Furthermore, zonal (beneath leaves)
    humidity sensors were also active during the summer months. Zonal humidity (spaces
    under the leaves) is extremely critical during August and September. As presented
    in Fig. 15, in Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, the zonal humidity was observed to
    be increased on 4 and 7 August, respectively, during which the farmer received
    the warning alarms via SMS. To avoid being exposed to probable fungal diseases,
    the leaves of the vines were thinned by the employed artisans. However, for Yovşanlıq
    vineyard, since the air temperature was immoderate, in order to protect the grape
    bunches from sun burning damage, the leaves were not thinned. Download : Download
    high-res image (121KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 15. Zonal humidity
    and temperature. It has been found that temperature and humidity are the most
    crucial parameters for improving the quality of the final products. In the cases
    of Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, humidity had the highest effects, whereas in Yovşanlıq
    vineyard, the temperature had the paramount importance. Another conducive parameter
    with a direct impact on the quality of the grapes and raisins is the sugar level
    of the berries. Since the WSN reported excessive zonal humidity (between the leaves
    and the face of Qanas) of Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, the leaves were trimmed
    in order to increase the amount of sunlight received by the vines. Consequently,
    the sugar level, flesh, and volume of the mature berries increased. However, because
    of the inherently dry climate of Yovşanlıq vineyard, the leaves of the vines were
    not trimmed. Accordingly, the schedule of harvesting time was determined and postulated
    by the system, resulting in the farmer first harvesting Yovşanlıq vineyard in
    early September and Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards in late September. 5.2. Drying
    structure The WSN system was used during October in order to monitor the fumigation
    and drying processes. In the fumigation process, three motes were utilized in
    every round of fumigation. To keep even and uniform diffusion, circulation, and
    concentration of the SO2 gas through the grape bunches, the motes were used in
    three disparate sections of the fumigation chamber inside the covering nylon.
    The motes were used in every round of fumigations. Using the WSN system, direct-close
    inspection and monitoring procedures were eliminated. Fig. 16 displays continuous
    monitoring for a typical round of the fumigation process. The webpage provided
    continuous monitoring via the relevant diagram and warning system. Additionally,
    the SMS module sent alarms in case of inordinate and lesser amounts of SO2 gas.
    As seen in Fig. 16, after 30 min, the amount of SO2 gas was decreased to 1392 ppm
    (57,907.2 µmol m−3). The operator received this inconvenient insufficiency by
    SMS, and, subsequently, an amount of sulfur powder was added to the sulfur container
    inside the chamber. This calibrated amount of sulfur powder was consumed in the
    next round. Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 16. Continuous monitoring for a typical round of the fumigation process.
    After every fumigation round, the nylon was unwrapped in order to let atmospheric
    air circulate through the grapes inside the building. One mote was implemented
    between every two columns in the back side beyond the hung grapes (between the
    wall and suspended grape bunches), where it is not approachable or accessible
    (Fig. 2). Generally, 10 motes were used inside the building during October and
    November in various locations of the drying building (structure). The humidity
    and temperature of the inside building were continuously monitored. During late
    October, since the air temperature plummeted in the region, the online warning
    system sent a rot prediction alarm via SMS and webpage. Subsequently, the raisin
    producers avoided the problem by providing a constant ventilated hot air flow
    inside the drying structure at 60 °C. Finally, in November, all the produced raisins
    (at 18% moisture content level) were gathered and stored in the storage room.
    The result showed that applying the WSN monitoring system in the vineyards and
    drying structure increased the quantity and quality of the grapes and final products.
    Particularly, grape and raisin production yield was increased 4 t/ha compared
    to the yield of the year before. Grape yield depends greatly on cultivation and
    climatic conditions and varies from one variety to another. This leads to a wide
    range of yields across the world: from 6 to 12 t/ha in France to 20–30 t/ha in
    the USA, especially in California (http://www.oiv.int/public/medias/4911/fao-oiv-grapes-report-flyer.pdf).
    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average yield of grape production
    in Iran is approximately 12 t/ha. In comparison with the average national yield,
    the yield was nearly increased to 6 tons per hectare (0.544 kg/m2). This means
    that the system was able to increase the yield more than 28%. Furthermore, inside
    the drying structure, raisins were produced without any dissipating damages stemmed
    from excessive fumigation or fungi. 6. Conclusion This paper shows WSN-based precision
    viticulture in traditional vineyards and drying processes. The system was developed
    on the basis of other successful experiences with wireless sensor network systems
    and decision-making supports in agriculture. The main components of the system
    are a gateway (composed of a Mini PC and receiver circuit) and thirty peripheral
    motes with installed relevant modules (nRF24L01 module, VS1003 acoustic module,
    GSM module, and GPS receivers) and sensors including temperature, humidity, soil
    pH and moisture, SO2 fumigation, and PIR. To display and browse the data, a web
    interface (Graphical User Interface; GUI) was designed to provide the vineyard
    locations on Google Maps, the graphical representations, the gauge charts, and
    the numerical data display. The webpage provides the desired data at the user’s
    request with simple clicks. The experimental results proved that the system reliably
    and satisfactorily performs the desired duties with simple architecture and devices
    and at reasonable prices. Using a Mini PC as the motherboard of the gateway has
    some considerable advantages such as a lower implementation cost, extended capabilities
    and easy changing of software-hardware, and being user-friendly, portable, and
    easy to use. Particularly, the proposed system offers great flexibility for using
    continuous modes and on-demand requests based on pooling mechanism. The results
    indicate that by using the system with an on-demand approach, the lifetime of
    the motes and the utilized power supply is increased. The implemented approach
    actuates the motes at the user’s demand to switch their sleeping/active modes
    whenever they are needed and to consequently save the energy supply. The system
    is able to predict imminent frost using real-time data of temperature and air
    humidity sensors located in the vineyards. By measuring the soil moisture and
    air humidity parameters, the system provides feasibility of scheduling the irrigation
    frequency. More importantly, the system is able to determine the optimum irrigation
    duration for each vineyard according to their climatic conditions. The overall
    results imply that since the amount of irrigated-evaporated water is high, flood
    irrigation (traditional irrigation) is not an efficient method. By obtaining soil
    pH data, the system is able to predict, warn, and monitor the nutrition deficiencies
    of the terrain. Furthermore, by measuring the data of the zonal (between the surface
    of the ‘Qana’ and leaves) humidity sensors, the system is able to prevent probable
    fungal diseases and sun burning damages. Consequently, the leaves controlling
    procedure is decided by the farmer so that in the case of immoderate humidity,
    the leaves of the vines can be thinned and in the case of too much heat, the leaves
    can remain untouched. As a result, the vineyards that receive more controlled
    sunlight grow larger berries. Finally, using the data obtained from the vineyards,
    the system can predict and schedule the harvesting time. Regarding the drying
    building (structure), the fumigation process can be continuously monitored in
    order to control the amount of SO2 gas inside the fumigation chamber. Importantly,
    by monitoring the process, the farmer can calibrate the amount of sulfur powder
    used. Subsequently, by continuously monitoring the humidity and temperature inside
    the building, the system can detect and predict the imminent rot damage. These
    experimental results suggest that a traditional drying building equipped with
    the proposed WSN-based system can serve as a useful platform for monitoring the
    drying process and subsequently for increasing the quality of the produced raisins.
    Finally, the proposed system is helpful for increasing the quality and quantity
    of the grapes and raisins. It is able to prevent probable diseases, foresee the
    nutrition demands, schedule and determine irrigation duration and frequency, and
    warn of predating insects. Specifically, by using the WSN data, farmers are able
    to schedule harvesting time based on maturity, quality, and productivity. 7. Future
    improvements This project can be extended in future studies in order to improve
    the system in various domains such as (1) The online warning system was not able
    to generate an alarm warning of the presence of nuisance insects. This warning
    system needs a comprehensive signal processing research project in order to detect
    and distinguish the depredating insect sounds from other environmental sounds.
    Moreover, an image processing method can be added to the system for recognizing
    deficiencies, pests, diseases, and other detrimental agents in the vineyards.
    (2) Sap-flow measurements as an indicator of vine transpiration and plant water
    status throughout the season can provide an alternative tool to optimize and manage
    irrigation. In future work, this method can be applied in the current WSN system.
    (3) Luminosity as a key factor of brightness analysis for estimating light radiation
    on plants can be applied for determining the sugar concentration, controlling
    the amount of sunlight received by the vines, and determining the optimum time
    for harvesting more accurately and timely. Furthermore, by utilizing light sensors,
    the WSN system can detect the presence of clouds or rain that are extremely deleterious
    during harvesting time. (4) Future studies can be focused on applying automated
    control for decision support systems through integration with an automatic irrigation
    system, frost preventing system, SO2 fumigation system, nuisance insect extirpating
    system, etc. The control commands can be counted in a locally centralized manner
    and then transmitted wirelessly to the actuators located in the vineyards and
    drying structures. (5) The dried raisins are stored in bulk (in the storage or
    packing house) before further processing. The raisins should be stored in cool,
    dry rooms. Specifically, the equilibrium moisture content (EMC), the point at
    which the raisins are neither gaining nor losing moisture, is important. The value
    of the EMC depends on the material and the relative humidity and temperature of
    the air. To maintain such equilibrium in moisture content of the stored raisins
    and to monitor the other parameters of the stored raisins, a WSN can be applied
    inside the storage or packing houses. References Beckwith et al., 2004 Beckwith,

    for crops like sugar beet (Bagherpour et al., 2015), sugarcane (Khorasani Fardavani
    et al., 2009), potatoes (Mohammad Zamani et al., 2014) and grapes (Karimi et al.,
    2018). However, the application of WSNs is mostly limited to studies and experiments,
    whereas the adoption of WSNs by farmers has not yet received enough attention.

    Excerpt : WSN typically contributed to the data collection process, and with IoT,
    it allowed the flow of data from the sensors to other devices for further processing
    and analysis to perform subsequent actions. There are many WSN and IoT applications
    in agriculture such as precision agriculture (Dasgupta et al., 2020; Jawad et
    al., 2017; Karimi et al., 2018; Wohwe Sambo et al., 2020), irrigation control
    and scheduling (Bodunde et al., 2019; García et al., 2021; Hamami & Nassereddine,
    2020; Khan et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021), environmental monitoring (Polo et
    al., 2015; Tahir et al., 2020; Vuli & Stojanovi, 2021), crop health monitoring
    (Amin et al., 2021; Sridhar and Sridhar, 2020; Catini et al., 2019), plant phenotyping
    (Al-Turjman, 2019; Kameoka et al., 2017; Zhen et al., 2017) and crops security
    (Shrihari, 2020). Smart farming solutions usually need to be customized and adapted
    accordingly as there are differences in yield gap and farm size as well as the
    necessity of integration of new technologies with the existing practices (Elijah
    et al., 2018). Show abstract Intelligent pointer meter interconnection solution

    Citation Excerpt : An agriculture wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important
    technology to collect agricultural data, which can provide support for intelligent
    decision making and automatic control, and is becoming increasingly important
    in modern agriculture (Kochhar and Kumar, 2019; Karimi et al., 2018; Tamoghna

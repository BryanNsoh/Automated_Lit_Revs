    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\

    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\

    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\
    \ scarcity problems. Again, there \nare some countries with regions affected by\
    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\

    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\
    \ 83\ninclude diﬀerent levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only indicate\
    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\
    \ without more detail. From those papers which oﬀer more\ndetails, 19 of them\
    \ include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation\
    \ [4,47–54],\ntwo propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use\
    \ a very speciﬁc irrigation systems\n(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or\
    \ it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with\nthe principal\
    \ irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51]\
    \ and two\npapers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].\nSensors\

    \ \nMost of the included papers in this section do not describe the target agriculture\
    \ system of their \nproposal. Nevertheless, there are 38 papers that include this\

    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\

    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\

    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\

    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\

    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\
    \ is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, New \nYork, USA). No other proposals\

    \ of temperature sensors for the water.  \nOn the other hand, with regard to the\
    \ proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter, the \ndata is presented\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ The use of three actuators is presented in seven papers, the same percentage\

    \ use four actuators [39,72], and in one case the use of ﬁve\nactuators is presented\
    \ [67].\nNext, we present in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators.\
    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\
    \ periods to increase\nproductivity, but they can also be used for operational\
    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\
    \ use\nof ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\
    \ least utilized actuators in IoT\nirrigation systems are scarecrows [58,65,66],\

    \ birds and other types of animals to protect the crops, and heaters [28,65],\

    \ and in one case the use of \nfive actuators is presented [67].  \nNext, we present\
    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\
    \ an \nalarm for the farmers or as a dissuasive measure to prevent the entry of\
    \ animals into the farming \nlands. In second position, we found the use of artificial\
    \ light systems. They are used in six cases \n[36,38,50,71,72,75]. The use of\
    \ artificial light is mainly related to the generation of artificial photo- \n\
    periods to increase productivity, but they can also be used for operational purposes.\
    \ Fans are \nincluded in five proposals and their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions \n(temperature, humidity or even the balance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of \nfans are [39,65,68,72,75].\
    \ The use of ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\

    \ in diﬀerent papers included in this\nsurvey, there is an important parameter\
    \ that is crucial for irrigation scheduling. This parameter\nindicates the water\
    \ loss due to the evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata\
    \ of\nplants; it is known as evapotranspiration (ET). Several authors measured\
    \ both terms—evaporation and\ntranspiration—separately, using diﬀerent sensors\
    \ to obtain the ET data [104]. It also can be estimated\naccording to the vegetation\
    \ and the climatic data by several mathematic models [105]. Some web-based\napplications\
    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\
    \ for ET monitoring with sensors,\nthe integration of soil moisture changes can\
    \ oﬀer evaporation data. Nonetheless, the measurement of\ntranspiration is more\
    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\

    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\
    \ edge, communication, and cloud. In these latest architectural proposals, the\
    \ authors use the \nedge layer to locate critical applications and perform basic\
    \ control processes. Also, as indicated by \n[216], cloud (internet/intranet)\
    \ can provide Web services, data storage, HMI interfaces or analytic \napplications.\

    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\

    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground\ncommunication. It is\
    \ especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture IoT\n\
    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\
    \ and it would\nreduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the\
    \ ﬁelds may receive. Although WiFi\nsurprisingly allows underground-above ground\
    \ communication in short distances and depths above\n30 cm [222], it would be\

    \ and the citizens themselves are increasing\ntheir awareness regarding sustainable\
    \ consumption. This not only aﬀects their view on the energy\nconsumption of IoT\

    and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable\
    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    Abstract In the modern world, the Internet of Things (IoT) has captured most of
    the applications in the market and it plays a significant role with various smart
    and interactive things that have provided a convenient environment for humans.
    Applications of IoT can be broadly classified based on consumer application, enterprise
    application, infrastructure management, industrial productivity, and so on. Some
    of the applications that implement the concepts of IoT are smart wearables, connected
    cars, industrial internet, precision agriculture, smart retail, energy management
    systems, and others. Advancement in IoT technology has resulted in automated home
    appliances and healthcare systems and also in the development of smart cities,
    smart homes, smart towns, and many more. For any application based on IoT, data
    are collected and are modeled using prediction analysis. The basic concept of
    using IoT is that it reduces waste, loss, and cost. The design of the IoT application
    should focus on increasing the energy efficiency and the cost efficiency of the
    system, improving safety, or creating better experiences. IoT is a field of the
    network, and it could be enabled either by wired or wireless communication networks.
    This refers to the technology where the machines could predict the data and work
    by itself. Here the devices that are connected to the private internet connection
    could communicate with others. The edge devices that are connected will create
    a huge amount of data. These data are generated at high speed, and also they face
    challenges like storage, computation, and networking. These issues can be handled
    by using cloud, edge, or cloud edge computing. This chapter focuses on the discussion
    of diverse applications in IoT because of its huge potential market, and also
    it enhances the comfort of our lives besides providing enhanced control of our
    daily and personal tasks with ease. Keywords IoT architecture IoT applications

    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” came into existence from 1999. Internet
    of Things has the power to change the world and is a system of interconnection
    between uniquely identifiable computing devices and mechanical and digital machines.
    This interconnection is made without involving human-to-human or human-to-machine
    interaction, and instead the data are transferred over the network. Internet of
    Things is a general concept where the devices could gather the data around the
    world and could share the data over the network where it could be utilized for
    various purposes. Wikipedia states, “The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection
    of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing Internet
    infrastructure”; i.e., it connects the embedded system to the internet. In recent
    years, there is an enormous development in the IoT field. Embedded systems are
    much attractive because of their low cost, low space, low power consumption, and
    autonomous factors. It also includes other factors such as I/O speed and cost,
    energy consumption, etc., based on the instructions. Figure 5.1, obtained from
    Wikipedia, depicts the technological roadmap for Internet of Things. From this
    figure, it can be observed that by 2000, RFID tags were used to track the routing
    of the inventory to prevent the loss of logistics. This paved way for increase
    in the demand for logistics by providing support for the supply chain helpers.
    By the mid of 2000–2010, vertical-market applications such as surveillance, security,
    healthcare, transport, food safety, document mapping have seen a great development
    in technological aspects. This development in vertical-market applications has
    led to the progression of ubiquitous computing, in which the technology helps
    to locate people and everyday objects. Locating the objects that reside anywhere
    even indoors or undergrounds where satellite technologies may be unavailable or
    inadequate is called ubiquitous positioning. As a next stage, the progress is
    towards the physical-world web for miniaturization, power-efficient electronics
    and available spectrum to control distant objects. Fig. 5.1 Technology roadmap:
    The Internet of Things Full size image Internet of Things could also be defined
    as the network of sensors where the data are exchanged under the connectivity
    using network protocols and systems. The exchange of data may be bidirectional
    or unidirectional where any one system could send or receive data or both. The
    organizations or the field of applications which heavily rely on data will make
    use of cloud, fog, or edge computing. These computing architectures help in greatly
    utilizing the variety of computing techniques, resources that provide data storage,
    and these also include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [1]. Though these
    computing mechanisms sound similar, they form different layers in IIoT. Figure
    5.2 is obtained from (www.winsystems.com); in this image, the authors have described
    the layers of IIoT. According to this site, cloud computing (or cloud layer) is
    treated as a major layer, and the extended layers of it are edge computing (or
    edge layer) and fog computing (or fog layer). These fog and edge layers are a
    collection of servers which includes distributed network. These layers help the
    organization by giving feasibility; hence, they need not keep the entire infrastructure
    on their own premises. This feasibility makes the data to be collected from any
    place, and it can also enhance the ability to access data allover. In order to
    increase the utilization of end-users and the IIoT devices, recent enterprises
    are moving towards edge or fog infrastructure. Fig. 5.2 IIoT data processing layer
    stack Full size image Fog and edge computing look similar in terms of intelligence
    and also in the way the data are processed. But they differ in identifying the
    location of the intelligence and also in power computation. In edge computing
    environment, intelligence is placed in devices like embedded automation controllers,
    whereas fog computing environment places intelligence in the local area network
    (LAN) itself. For processing the power, fog computing uses edge devices and the
    gateways along with the LAN, but in the case of edge, the processing power is
    placed with the intelligence. Hence, the most challenging features in this computing
    are power consumption, latency, security, and also the data size which can be
    distributed across the network. Older IoT technologies include a virtually infinite
    number of endpoints connected to the network. Because of this advantage, data
    collection and processing has become a biggest challenge. In order to solve this
    challenge, edge computing is introduced. The computation processes which are performed
    at the nodes have given a feel as if it is performed at the data source itself.
    Edge computing can also be stated as an extension of older technologies. The extended
    features available in the edge computing are peer-to-peer networking, distributed
    data, self-healing network technology, and remote cloud services. Improved hardware
    security and also lowering the power requirement are satisfying factors that are
    provided by the processors of edge computing systems. This edge computing system
    also provides a highly optimal solution as the hardware is embedded with the flash-storage
    arrays. The concept of interaction of the centralized system with embedded systems
    and industrial gateways is used in fog computing. Much of the data processing
    of edge computing is performed directly at the embedded computing platforms by
    making an interface with the sensors and controllers. Optimizing resource usage
    in a cloud-computing system is one of the advantages provided in edge computing
    besides more advantages like reducing network traffic and improved security. The
    following subsections explicate the IoT applications along with the concept of
    cloud computing. 5.2 IoT Applications Table 5.1 gives a short description of the
    IoT applications which will be discussed in detail. Table 5.1 Short description
    of IoT applications Full size table 5.2.1 Infrastructure Management IoT infrastructure
    consists of three major parts such as sensing infrastructure, computing infrastructure,
    and storage infrastructure. Sensing infrastructure includes communicating and
    sensing devices. Computing infrastructure is needed for computing the power consumption
    and to effectively manage the dynamic loads from various sensors. Depending upon
    the user need, this infrastructure has to be modeled. Traditional storage infrastructure
    has to be replaced with updated storage infrastructure in order to satisfy the
    users, as there is a drastic increase in the need of sensor. Infrastructure management
    is needed to monitor and control the devices in rural and urban area infrastructures.
    This infrastructure includes various applications such as bridges, railways, farms,
    etc. The infrastructure is controlled by monitoring the change in state of the
    application devices. If the device is compromised whenever there is a change in
    the state of an event, and if unnoticed will result in high risk. Infrastructure
    management helps in taking quick decisions and also in saving money with real-time
    analytics. It can also be used to schedule an event like repair and maintenance
    activities in industry, which will be performed by coordinating the task between
    the service providers and the users. With these facilities, IoT helps in improving
    quality of service, timely event handling process, coordinating the responses,
    and also reducing the cost. Many fields like manufacturing, agriculture, energy
    management, environmental monitoring, building and home automation, metropolitan
    scale deployments, etc, are benefitted with this infrastructure management. 5.2.2
    Industrial IoT (IIoT) IIoT describes the usage of Internet of Things across several
    industrial activities like manufacturing, logistics, metals, and mining and in
    other sectors. Internet of Things is a transformative manufacturing technology
    which improves safety, quality, and productivity in industries [3]. The main aim
    of the Industrial Internet of Things is to have a high output at the rate of same
    input and to achieve same output in the cost of low input. All goods and products
    in the industry are labeled with near field communication (NFC) tags and radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) tags which helps to monitor the goods available in the industry
    and helps to order goods if it is insufficient. It also helps to reduce time in
    searching the specific products in the industry and also reduces labor cost. The
    primary advantages of the Industrial Internet of Things are as follows: Predictive
    maintenance Real-time monitoring Scalability and time saving Resource optimization
    The study, The Impact of Connectedness on Competitiveness, is based on a global
    survey of 350 executives from large enterprises. It found that more than half
    (52%) of executives at large enterprises expect IIoT to have a “significant” or
    “major” impact on their industry within 3 years, with another third (32%) forecasting
    a “moderate” impact in that timeframe. Security is the major factor for all industries
    and everyone is in need to know that their data is well secured. Security vulnerabilities
    are highly prevented by using sensors, smart connected devices, and by other methods.
    5.2.3 Smart Retail IoT brings a number of applications for retailers for improving
    store operations, minimizing theft occurrences; increasing customer purchase by
    selling more number of the products to them, and also producing a new inventory
    product [7]. It will make the customer know everything in the store and aid them
    closer to the buying decision. RFID tags are attached to every product in the
    store, and its availability is checked periodically. Customers gain the information
    about the goods through Bluetooth beacons or other digital receivers. The digital
    signature will navigate the customer to the product. The following actions can
    be performed for improvising the quality of purchase and make the customer think
    and take an easy decision in buying a product. From the analytics, the retailer
    will know about customer’s perspectives which will later help in improvising their
    product according to the customer’s interest. Interactive digital signature screens
    Mobile shopping applications Sensor-based items tracking Tailored digital marketing
    Optimized inventory management Mobile payment solutions IoT-enabled beacons Customer
    preferences analytics For security purposes in the retail shops, multiple video
    cameras are positioned within the shop premises at present. Using these cameras,
    images are captured and are streamed to the cloud for storage and also for further
    analysis, if required. These are implemented for security reasons or can also
    be used to monitor the customer behavior within the store. As an extension, it
    helps the proprietor of the store to keep an eye on the happenings of the store
    including the cash flow. For implementing a secured store, the store is in need
    of at least one gateway to connect various equipment with the sensors and also
    to collect the image data and store it in the cloud platform. Many companies are
    working on this issue to give better security to the retail store. 5.2.4 Smart
    Supply Chain IoT supports supply chain management by performing operational efficiencies
    and revenue opportunities. The supply chain transparency captures the extent to
    which information about the companies, suppliers, and sourcing locations are readily
    available to end-users and also to other companies in the supply chain. Security
    is the most important aspect that has to be considered. All the information must
    be prevented from falling into the wrong hands or being hacked. Sensors should
    only send specific information, which must be held in a secure private cloud environment.
    Product Tracking RFID and GPS sensors track product from the manufacturing place
    to the storage location. They will monitor the product, and hence the manufacturer
    can gain granular data like the temperature at which an item is stored and so
    on. These data will help in improvising the quality control, on-time deliveries,
    and product forecasting. Vendor Relations Data obtained from product tracking
    are also helpful to companies for updating their own production schedules and
    also recognize the vendor relationships that may be costing them money. These
    will test how vendors are handling supplies and sending goods to the manufacturer.
    High-quality goods define a better relationship with customers, and the better
    customer is retained. Forecasting and Inventory Another major parameter which
    is difficult to manage in the supply chain management is inventory. Smart devices
    are closely monitored, and they deal with more variable than earlier applications.
    Equipment monitoring provides information about predictive maintenance and alerting
    engineers for potential breakdowns and costly disruption. Consider Amazon Go as
    an example that uses IoT, computer vision, machine learning, and AI to create
    a shopping experience where the user can just walk in, pick up whatever the user
    needs, and can walk out with a purchase. In [15], the authors have proposed a
    cloud-centric IoT architecture for supply chain management (SCM). In traditional
    SCM, the movement of physical objects was performed directly, whereas, in this
    paper, the authors have controlled and coordinated the supply chain process based
    on object sensing. For implementing this framework, they have used proposed layers
    in their framework, namely, object management, cloud computing platform, information
    as a service, and smartphone user. Thirty-one percent of manufacturers are implementing
    Internet of Things enhancements to their internal operations, with another 56%
    exploring doing so in order to cut operational costs, achieve supply chain efficiencies,
    and improve predictive maintenance capabilities. Operations performed with these
    layers include submission of request by the user to the cloud; the cloud computing
    platform will make response to the user by identifying the location; this cloud
    computing platform helps the user to update the data in the database and hence
    the user can publish the sensed information; with the received information, the
    cloud will perform operation and will return the user about the task which is
    mapped according to the physical location of the user; and finally all the transactions
    and the conversations are stored to the cloud for future references. 5.2.5 Transportation
    and Logistics IoT improves the transportation industry by improving economic development,
    public safety, and the environment. IoT monitors the goods and analyses the data
    with the help of sensors. Location of the vehicle can be predicted by GPS, roadside
    sensors, etc., and finally, the products will be delivered on time, at the right
    place. The real-time traffic monitoring is explained in [10]. Some special delivering
    vehicles are available to deliver sensitive products, to be stored in a cool place.
    Environmental sensors can monitor temperature, humidity, light, and vibration
    in real time. These sensors have the capability to detect the occurrence of any
    problem, and they are alarmed so that corrective measures can be taken to prevent
    spoiling of goods. The data that are collected from different sensors are massive
    in size to be stored in the cloud. Safety and security is the main reason for
    the development of the transportation industry with IoT. Thus, there is no loss
    of goods, and hence they are transported to the destined place without any damage.
    By maximizing the profitability and viability, the efficiency of the supply chain
    is improved in transportation and logistics field. With the improved development
    in the fields of mobile technology and IoT, the enterprises are connecting the
    transportation- and logistics-related devices with the centralized cloud network
    to gain information about the real-time operations in transportation and logistics
    by capturing and sharing the information about the critical data. The information
    about the critical data is shared in to make sure that the right product is delivered
    to the right place at the right time. This paves way for the development in various
    fields such as asset management, cloud, mobile, and big data. 5.2.6 Connected
    Cars Internet of Things paves a great and fresh way for the car manufacturers
    to upgrade their cars in a highly competitive market. As stated in [2] by Kevin
    Ashton, this also enhances the idea, where a person can drive around the world
    and can stay connected all the time. Before the invention of IoT in automobiles,
    one has to search for the route manually, while the IoT has made it more convenient.
    For example, a person could set the destination place using Ground Positioning
    Systems (GPS), and the driver will be directed to the destination place and this
    also needs some improvements. Auto-pilot mode is the most modern technology introduced
    in recent times. High-resolution cameras can be used to detect soft and hard objects
    in the lane and also in the vehicle surroundings. Forward-facing radar with enhanced
    processing collects additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength
    that helps the user to see through heavy rain, fog, dust, and even the car behind
    and ahead. This could also aid in detecting the traffic signals and signs that
    are already inbuilt in the system and could drive the car as safe as possible.
    It can also adapt to the changes in the environmental roads around the world,
    and it could also offer lane change automatically. IHS Markit predicts that more
    than 70 million connected cars will be on the road by 2023. Designing a connected
    vehicle platform on cloud IoT core will be a better solution for managing the
    connected cars by making a use of cloud IoT core on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    The use cases that can be defined by making a combination with data storage and
    platforms are usage-based insurance, predictive maintenance, freight tracking,
    and customized in-vehicle experience. The main challenges that a development team
    will face in this domain are device management, data ingestion, data analytics,
    applications, and predictive models. Besides these challenges, the developer must
    also focus on security and set the boundary level for the applications they design
    that are implemented in the cloud-based system. 5.2.7 Self-Parking Vehicles Self-driving
    cars are learned from the data cloud, the collections of data are brakes, tire
    and transmission performance, fuel consumption, and efficiency of the vehicle.
    The main reason for self-driving is high safety, and it will abide all traffic
    rules and regulation as shown in [5]. Averagely, parking coverage takes 31% of
    land use in big cities, like San Francisco, and even more, 81% in Los Angeles
    and 76% in Melbourne, while at the lower end we find New York (18%), London (16%),
    and Tokyo (7%). Hence, the removal of unnecessary parking areas is the first task
    for municipalities to create a better urban planning. The data are provided with
    high security, and the hackers cannot access the data easily without the user’s
    authorization. There exists confusion when the user tries parking his or her vehicle,
    and it leads to great pressure and stress to the user which also results in waste
    of time. As self-driving vehicle is automatically parked in the parking area without
    any confusion it reduces pressure as well as the time for user. IoT predicts the
    current scenario and performs the action according to the problem. In [16], the
    authors have designed a smart parking system. In this system, the authors have
    specified that the system can be implemented for any type of parking like parking
    available at covered parks, open parks, and also street side parking. For this
    system, the authors have designed an architecture which includes cloud service
    provider. The main function of this cloud service provider is to collect information
    about the parking area and store the information in the cloud. The major components
    of this smart parking system are centralized server, Raspberry Pi, image capturing
    device, a navigation system, displaying device, and the user device. The centralized
    server acts as a database that will hold the entire information about the parking
    system, some of the information includes a number of parking slots, availability
    of vehicles, and so on. Raspberry Pi is a microcontroller used to implement the
    parking system with a camera attached to it. This Pi-camera is used to capture
    pictures of the parking area for validating the area to check the availability
    of slots in that area. The main role of the navigation system is to navigate the
    users to the available parking lot which is nearer to his or her current location.
    Displaying device is a monitor or tab available at the admin’s location to monitor
    the device and to modify the parking lot if needed. The user device is used to
    connect the user with the parking system using their smartphones or browsers.
    5.2.8 Smoke Detectors Safety of life is more important when compared to any other
    application. Records show that many lives were exploited by fire accidents, and
    also it takes a longer duration for the fire service to reach the destination.
    To avoid these types of accidents, many companies are using IoT devices for safety.
    It is safe in many ways as it is more evident that if fire accident occurs, it
    automatically connects itself to the hot-connect or cloud environment and it directly
    sends a voice or text message to the concerned fire agency. The working principle
    is not like the normal smoke detectors which could only give beeping alarm sounds
    but it also helps to save people. This has battery power that is estimated to
    last up to 10 years and also it is not a big bottleneck to change the battery.
    It is more rapidly replacing the normal smoke detectors as this proves to be more
    useful and also available at an affordable cost. One thousand smoke detector surveys
    were mailed, covering about 70 percent of the town’s households. While the results
    staggered in over a period of 3 months, 315 completed surveys (31.5 percent) were
    ultimately returned. The high return rate can be interpreted as a strong interest
    on the part of the public concerning fire safety. In the industrial sector, the
    smoke detectors play a different role, where it is used as the contamination detector.
    The detector is placed at the chimney and monitors the smoke that is being passed
    out through it. If the contaminants are greater than the recommended level, it
    will send a warning message to the main supervisor and also to the concerned person
    so that it will never be ignored. It ensures green living to all the people and
    greatly reduces pollution. 5.2.9 Smart Cities As described by Gauer, A., Smart
    City Architecture and its applications based on IoT in [4], smart cities improve
    the quality of lifestyle by improving infrastructures like delivering clean water,
    dependable power, and efficient public lighting. The main motive of a smart city
    is to provide more efficient water supply, an innovative solution to traffic congestion,
    and more reliable public transportation. Water can be highly saved by providing
    the following facilities. Leakage detection in pipes Wastewater recycling Managing
    the storm-water The benefits of the smart city include increased safety, reduced
    traffic, lower levels of pollution, more efficient use of energy, and improve
    the overall quality of life for future city dwellers. The main aim of the smart
    cities is extended to keep the citizens safe, and it should provide education
    and technological job opportunities to the citizens with open innovation. Gujarat
    International Finance Tec-City stands as a great example for smart cities. It
    has better city planning and development, and internet facility is provided all
    over the city with a faster supply of products at a lower operating expense. The
    major issue stands in the contamination of air, and to resolve this issue many
    green buildings are set up. The companies which focus on security management can
    be connected with smoke detectors so that they can protect the buildings from
    fire. The device will send the message to the cloud-based dashboard only if the
    fire is detected or if the system is in need of maintenance. This will greatly
    reduce the man-hours in performing the maintenance check frequently, and even
    the process may not be needed. These connected smoke detectors are more advantageous
    when compared to the traditional system. These smoke detectors can be connected
    to devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets or smart-phones to get alert messages
    which proves helpful for fire security personnel. 5.2.10 Construction The main
    problem faced by a worker in a construction industry is misplacing the equipment
    at the construction sites which leads to time consumption in searching the equipment
    or may cause any damage to the equipment. IoT keeps on monitoring the equipment
    by sensors by GPS tracking attached to the equipment. RIFD tags will be attached
    to the devices so that tracking can be made easy. The cost of the equipment is
    comparably higher than earlier devices. This will help the consumer to buy the
    equipment only once in a lifetime, instead of purchasing frequently whenever it
    is missed. Repair and service of the equipment can be monitored, and the problem
    could be resolved with a warning alert from the equipment. Energy consumption
    by the equipment can be minimized by the sensors which will adjust the actions
    to be performed by the tools automatically. The sensors will automatically switch
    on/off to save energy. The main advantage is the quality work is increased and
    more convenient for users. The construction project work can be done on time,
    and the quality of the construction can be improved. The future Internet of Things
    will provide intelligent building management systems which can be considered as
    a part of a much larger information system used by facilities managers in buildings
    to manage energy use and energy procurement and to maintain efficient building
    management systems. 5.2.11 Smart Homes Google is highly potential and develops
    automation in everything. As everything in the home is well organized and fully
    computerized, they are all controlled simply with a mobile application which leads
    to controlling and monitoring the devices that are installed in the home [17].
    The devices that are using electricity can be added to the network. Smart homes
    also provide high security which prevents hackers from penetration. Several companies
    have developed smart appliances which include smart fridges, televisions, and
    air conditioners. For example, Nest is an automated thermostat which senses the
    temperature and adjusts the air conditioner to the favorable means, i.e., if the
    external temperature is high, it lowers the internal temperature and vice versa
    which makes the people comfortable. In [12], the authors describe the privacy
    and security challenges in smart homes. In [18], the authors have designed a smart
    home in such a way that the device will record the daily activities inside the
    home and store the information in the cloud storage. The device will get familiar
    with this information, and hence at a later stage, the device will do the similar
    operations without the requirement of human intervention. 5.2.12 Smart Panels
    A smart panel can perform multiple functions like tracking the electrical usage
    and wastage in a detailed manner, and it also displays the result on the computer
    screen. They are simple, flexible, and have an open architecture which proves
    that they are simple in construction and implementation. Using these applications,
    the user can remotely access the electrical units which are installed far away
    which help in reducing the electrical energy. Another type is smart solar panels,
    and these have multiple abilities which could perform different actions depending
    on the conditions required. For example, this panel can be used to convert solar
    energy into electrical energy or to the required form of energy in which it acts
    as a transducer in one form and it could convert air into drinking water from
    the sunlight and air in another form. All the installed panels are monitored by
    the organization. The purity and taste of the water are obtained by adding the
    required minerals to it. It is connected and so it provides optimized performance.
    It could provide an average of 8–20 bottles of water per day. The main advantage
    of using these panels is they need not be hooked up to the home’s electrical systems,
    and they use full renewable resources to gain energy. 5.2.13 Energy Management
    Energy is a very important aspect for any household, industries, agriculture,
    and so on. Managing energy source and conserving it for better performance is
    a challenging task. IoT paradigm promises to increase the visibility and awareness
    of energy consumption, thanks to smart sensors and smart meters at the machine
    and production line level. Since every appliance depends on energy supply, energy
    plays a vital role in day-to-day life. An interface like Arduino Microcontrollers
    controls the usage of an appliance like the intensity of light and the speed of
    the fan. Humidity, temperature, and light intensity are taken into consideration
    in developing a better IoT system for energy management. IoT devices are controlled
    and connected for small cities and communities, transportation systems, buildings,
    lighting systems, factories, and more devices. Building Energy Management Systems
    (BEMs) attracted $1.4 B in VC Funding from 2000 to 2014 (26% of all investment
    in building energy technology). In 2020, about 77% of the $2.14 billion US market
    will comprise BEMS applications, and 40% will come from buildings below 50,000
    square feet. The US market for sensors and controls for BEMs will rise at a 17%
    compound annual growth rate to $2.14 billion in 2020. Possible future directions
    for energy management are as follows: Energy-efficient mechanisms for software-defined
    IoT solutions, which can provide scalable and context-aware data and services.
    Fog computing can lead to energy saving for most of the IoT applications; therefore,
    it is important to study energy consumption of fog devices for IoT applications.
    5.2.14 Smart Wearables Wearable devices are considered as the hot topic these
    days. A reduced job is much preferred in every field which resulted in this technology.
    Some of the important functions to be considered for a smart wearable in the industrial
    location is it could sense cut-off radiation level and will alert the user when
    the environment becomes worse. Health- and fitness-related devices are also available
    these days which could monitor the heartbeat rate, blood pressure, footsteps count,
    sleep monitor, etc. Some of the useful features are it could find the body temperature
    by which the user could get an early indication of cold or flu. Most of the users
    have a question why to use a wearable gadget while a single smartphone could do
    all these work. It is not comfortable to take our smartphone for every transaction,
    but the smartphone will act as the central unit of the wearable by connecting
    it through Bluetooth or the network which grants access for the wearable to surf
    the data available in the smartphone. Further, wearable reduces manual work to
    a great extent where the devices in the home are being connected and the user
    can control any of the devices which are connected in the same network without
    requiring any movement from place to place. 5.2.15 Environmental Monitoring The
    main application of IoT in the environmental monitoring is weather forecasting
    and monitoring, protecting endangered species, water safety, and many more applications.
    Current weather forecasting and monitoring applications include the need for the
    labor work, but implementing IoT in this field greatly reduces this effort. Sampling
    is done at regular intervals, and it helps to prevent contamination of air in
    many stages. IoT allows deep monitoring of weather in a specific range of area
    using IoT installed with radar. This promises more fine-grained data with great
    accuracy and range. This helps in early detection and early warning which reduces
    the loss of life and property [11]. Low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) technology
    is perfectly suited for environmental monitoring, as it can connect devices that
    need to stay in the field for an extended period of time and send small amounts
    of data over a long range. There are a number of reasons you may want to select
    LPWAN technology for your IoT environmental monitoring: Long battery life Low
    cost Long range Satellite backhaul ability 5.2.16 Biological Sensors Biosensors
    are gaining more interest nowadays, and they promise to be one of the constant
    growing fields in IoT [9]. Biosensors are mainly used in the field of healthcare,
    applications related to sports, and mostly in the military. The main advantage
    of this application is low cost and also provides real-time information. The term
    “wearable biosensors” (WBS) is evolved by combining both the smart wearable and
    the biosensors in a single unit. The required sensors are installed in the various
    parts of the body so they could be monitored all the time, without any whatsoever
    disturbances. Their size will be very small which makes them easy to carry wherever
    the user moves. Based on the usage of such sensors, these devices are popularly
    named as immunosensors, glucometers, biocomputers, etc., some of the examples
    include (1) Google lens (2) ring sensor and (3) smart shirt. 5.2.17 Healthcare
    Systems According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 31 percent of global
    deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases (estimated 17.7 million people in 2015).
    The number of people with diabetes has been rapidly increasing from 108 million
    in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The rising cost of healthcare services has increased
    the need for providing effective and efficient healthcare to the patients in most
    of the developing countries. Internet of Things stands as the key component for
    the digital transformation of healthcare systems. Internet of Healthcare Things
    (IoHT) and Internet of Medical Things are considered to be the two most important
    parts of healthcare systems which include smart pills, smart personal healthcare,
    and real-time health systems. This is mainly designed for those who do not find
    time to spend on their health life, whereas here they could easily check their
    health issues with easy IoT healthcare systems. This is not only suitable for
    an individual but easy for everyone to register with their health issues and get
    appropriate remedy, and also this initiative will reduce spending money for a
    periodical check-up. IoT-based healthcare for the elderly is the cheapest and
    more efficient way for applications related to healthcare. ECG, heartbeat rate,
    and body moisture can easily be found using this application. Appointment of the
    doctors can be made and it will also help in periodical indication for the pills
    at right time. Healthcare IoT systems ensure some basic ideas that can now be
    used to monitor the patient remotely, but in future, it will surely be an important
    member in the healthcare industry to maintain the healthcare and its related activities.
    The health records of the users are collected and are stored in electronic healthcare
    records (EHR) which makes the past data as well as the present data to be readily
    available at any time. While considering the security of the personal health records,
    IoT considers this as sensitive data and has some stricter rules that should be
    followed. Genetic materials and other personal details are stored in a private
    environment. In [13], the authors have proposed a device named Cellcon. This device
    is developed based on the image analysis concept which is portable and also affordable
    to do the process. This is a hardware device with a ball lens and a mobile application.
    The authors designed this application to do the cell count and to identify the
    presence of the malarial parasite. The blood sample is collected in a slide and
    a photo is taken by a ball lens that is attached to the phone clip, and hence
    a magnified image of the blood sample is obtained. This IoT device uses cloud
    storage for storing the image data, retrieve the data, and perform the analysis
    through and from the internet. The image is compared with the images in the database
    and the results are sent to the patient. In this application, the first half of
    the application, i.e., collecting the blood sample and taking a photo, is performed
    at the patient’s location. The patient may reside at any remote location, and
    the image data will be passed via the internet. The doctor will analyze the image
    data using the application which is installed in his mobile, and this belongs
    to the second phase of the application. 5.2.18 Precision Agriculture Precision
    agriculture makes rapid changes in the agricultural sector, and numerous organizations
    are leveraging this technique around the world. IoT makes agriculture field highly
    efficient. CropMetrics is a precision agricultural organization concentrated on
    ultra-modern agronomic solutions. Wireless sensor network (WSN) and wireless moisture
    sensor network (WMSN) are used in IoT. WSN technology contains many sensors, which
    are used to monitor and control to do proper irrigation. This optimization will
    maximize the profitability of irrigated crop fields, improves yields, and increases
    water usage efficiently. Agricultural drones are applied to farming in order to
    help increase crop production and monitor crop growth. Through the use of advanced
    sensors and digital imaging capabilities, farmers are able to use these drones
    to help them gather a richer picture of their fields. An advantage of drones is
    crop health, convenient to use, and increase in yield production. IoT reduces
    the human intervention in farming. Today’s sophisticated commercial farms have
    exploited advanced technologies; however, IoT introduces more access to deeper
    automation and analysis. In [14], the authors have projected the problems faced
    by the farmers in the real world. The farmers will be holding the agricultural
    land which is measured in hectares, and it is highly difficult for the farmers
    to identify the infected crop that is spread out in a vast area. Besides these
    criteria, the farmers also face certain other issues like rainfall prediction,
    climate, availability of water, and so on. Also, the farmers are not ready to
    cultivate different or hybrid crops in their land, as they lack knowledge and
    less experience in this scenario. In order to support the farmers in these conditions,
    a sensor device can be placed in the soil that is used for monitoring the climatic
    changes, temperature, and even soil moisture. The data observed by the sensors
    are stored with the help of cloud storage; this stored information will be used
    in future for analyzing and predicting the soil status and also about the feasible
    crop which can be cultivated with the existing soil and weather conditions. This
    concept of implementing cloud will aid in the expansion of data storage, and this
    will greatly reduce the production cost. 5.2.19 Poultry and Farming IOT is an
    innovative technology that provides modern and automated poultry farming. Basic
    environment parameters for poultry farming are temperature, humidity, ammonia
    gas, and water level. For instance, the temperature is controlled by cooling fan,
    humidity is monitored by the exhaust fan, ammonia gas is examined by ventilation
    window open, and the water level is maintained by DC motor. These actions are
    performed by the sensor, and monitoring is done the whole day. These are done
    mainly for the growth and health of the chicken. Farming challenges caused by
    population growth and climate change have made it one of the first industries
    to utilize the IoT in this sector. 5.2.20 Smart Surveillance The major issue in
    the secured environment is to safeguard our buildings, assets, and so on [8].
    The basic alarm facilities of earlier days had high visibility and later on introduced
    a monitoring camera which has some less scope of treatment. Internet of Things
    helps to create smart homes and smart cities by adding a feature of real-time
    monitoring services to the environment which concerns more about the security
    by the use of smart surveillance and security [6]. To make it simpler, let us
    consider that the user uses network cameras to monitor the area under surveillance
    and high-resolution cameras for the places of large crowd movement. IoT will offer
    a greater solution to such disparate things by considering the above scenarios
    by combining the video surveillance cameras and smoke detectors into a “small
    and single glass pane.” As all the devices will be monitored over a network, they
    could share data among them and could take decisions by themselves by which the
    security will be enhanced. The images produced by the video surveillance cameras
    should have high clarity, and this would be true by adopting Internet of Things.
    Nowadays, megapixel technology has grown to its peak by incorporating them with
    low-lighting cameras which are now blooming successor of the present market. These
    are all concerned with the wide dynamic range (WDR) of cameras. IoT offers a resolution
    of at least three times greater, and even 4 k videos could be generated using
    IoT. 5.3 Conclusion There are many benefits that arise with the increased use
    of Internet of Things. IoT is used in our everyday life as it greatly reduces
    the cost and power. Hence, this chapter has given an overview of applications
    using IoT. IoT has the potential to drive integrated solutions that can make a
    difference. The entire world is transforming slowly with the use of IoT in daily
    life. Also, the people are getting ample opportunities to enhance their commitments
    and perform various activities using smart things. This chapter has given a short
    description of various applications that are implemented with IoT and also certain
    challenges faced in those applications. Research work can be extended in the challenges
    faced and giving increased security to the applications to provide the better,
    smart and secured environment. References L. Da Xu, W. He, S. Li, Internet of

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\
    \ Introduction to IoTA\n– IoTA architecture\n– IoTA applications and IoTA solutions\n\
    – Existing vulnerabilities in IoTA\n– Existing and novel cyber crimes on IoTA\n\
    – DF challenges in IoTA.\nThe review article is organized in following way: Sec-\n\
    tion 2 includes the review selection methodology. Section 3\ncontains a literature\
    \ review has been taken through the IoTA\narchitecture. IoTA application and available\
    \ IoTA solutions\nto existing vulnerabilities in IoTA. Existing and novel cyber\n\
    crimes were pertaining to IoTA and DF challenges in IoTA.\nOur views on DF challenges\
    \ are discussed in Section 4. This\nreview paper has discussed directions for\
    \ future research and\nchallenges in IoTA tools and techniques. This article is\
    \ con-\ncluded in Section 5.\n2 Review Selection Method\nIn this article, we have\
    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\
    \ the article published between 2011-2022.\nThe third step was to include articles\
    \ related to IoT/IOTA\nonly. The fourth phase was to check articles related to\
    \ IoTA\nor IoT architecture, security, CACC and DF challenges. All\nthe articles\
    \ fall in these categories that have been included\nin the systematic review.\
    \ The search focused on the scientiﬁc\nresearch publishers like Elsevier, IEEE\
    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\

    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\

    \ the network. The control\nlayer works as a decision maker and performs analysis\
    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\
    \ The information is then passed to the Network\nlayer for its secure transmission\
    \ to the information [39]. The\n5\nTable 1: Comparision of Different IoTA Architectures\n\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

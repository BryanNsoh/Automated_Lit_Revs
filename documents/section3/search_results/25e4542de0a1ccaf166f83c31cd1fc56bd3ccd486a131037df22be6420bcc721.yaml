    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    Daily water balance of a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern
    Inner Mongolia, China, comparing a wet and a dry year with focusing on the groundwater
    contribution from a shallow water table (adapted from Wu et al., 2016). Results
    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    \ rates to crop water demand based\non estimates of actual evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET). In production settings, monitoring of water demand\nis typically accomplished\
    \ by measuring reference ET rather than actual ET, which is then adjusted\napproximately\
    \ using simpliﬁed crop coefﬁcients based on calendars of crop maturation. Methods\
    \ to\ndetermine actual ET are usually limited to use in research experiments for\
    \ reasons of cost, labor and\nrequisite user skill. To pair monitoring and research\
    \ methods, we co-located eddy covariance sensors\nwith on-farm weather stations\
    \ over two different irrigated crops (vegetable beans and hazelnuts).\nNeural\
    \ networks were used to train a neural network and utilize on-farm weather sensors\
    \ to report\nactual ET as measured by the eddy covariance method. This approach\
    \ was able to robustly estimate\nET from as few as four sensor parameters (temperature,\
    \ solar radiation, humidity and wind speed)\nwith training time as brief as one\
    \ week. An important limitation found with this machine learning\nmethod is that\
    \ the trained network is only valid under environmental and crop conditions similar\
    \ to\nthe training period. The small number of required sensors and short training\
    \ times demonstrate that\nthis approach can estimate site-speciﬁc and crop speciﬁc\
    \ ET. With additional ﬁeld validation, this\napproach may offer a new method to\
    \ monitor actual crop water demand for irrigation management.\nKeywords: machine\
    \ learning; site-speciﬁc; actual evapotranspiration; irrigation efﬁciency\n1.\
    \ Introduction\nEfﬁcient irrigation depends on reliable crop water demand information\
    \ to prevent drought stress\nand maximize yield from available water resources.\
    \ One direct measure of crop water consumption is\nactual evapotranspiration (ETa).\
    \ Precision irrigation technology depends on localized, spatially explicit\nand\
    \ real-time estimates of crop water needs to achieve the potential efﬁciency gains\
    \ offered by precision\nmethods. Growers and irrigation specialists currently\
    \ have many information resources including\nhistorical water records, regional\
    \ weather networks and remotely-sensed estimates of weather and\nwater demand\
    \ [1]. Irrigation research and weather monitoring networks facilitate improved\
    \ irrigation\nby providing detailed information about actual crop water demand\
    \ [2]. However, appropriately\nlocalized and real-time estimates of crop water\
    \ demand are either unaffordable or unavailable [3].\nBecause the risk of yield\
    \ reduction or crop failure are highly dependent on timing of water application,\n\
    real-time measurements of water demand are necessary [4,5]. Further progress in\
    \ mapping crop water\ndemand will depend on new measurement technology and methods.\
    \ For these measurements to\nbe useful to producers, they must be affordable,\
    \ accessible and compatible with existing irrigation\nsystems and farming practices\
    \ [6]. Site-speciﬁc, real-time ET data provides precise information to\nsupport\
    \ irrigation scheduling, facilitating optimal allocation decisions, mitigating\
    \ crop loss risks and\nimproving overall irrigation efﬁciency.\nAgronomy 2019,\

    \ 2019, 9, 108\n2 of 17\nIrrigation allows arid regions to be among the most agriculturally\
    \ productive per unit area and\nmaterial inputs, yet uncertainty about water supply\
    \ adds an additional dimension of risk [7]. Climate\nchange, drought and water\
    \ allocation rights are all important drivers of water availability and must\n\
    factor into crop and irrigation planning [8]. Likewise, advances in precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially\nreduce water use while maintaining yields but these\
    \ systems are similarly constrained by an absence\nof local real time data at\
    \ the ﬁeld scale [3]. In practice, implementation of science based irrigation\n\
    strategies, such as deﬁcit irrigation; site speciﬁc or variable rate irrigation\
    \ requires reliable data about\ncrop water demand. In the case of incremental\
    \ water use reductions, the risks of under-watering can\noutweigh any cost of\
    \ over-watering [4]. This is especially true during periods when ET estimates\n\
    are more uncertain, such as with deﬁcit irrigation or extreme weather conditions\
    \ (drought and heat),\nwhen atmospheric, soil or crop behaviors do not conform\
    \ to critical method assumptions (such as\na adequately-watered surface). Relying\
    \ on regional weather network data, science-based estimates of\ncrop water demand\
    \ are often not localized enough to make incremental water decisions within the\n\
    framework of a farm’s overall water planning [9]. Every farm venture must manage\
    \ inherent risk from\nweather and crop variability. Irrigators make daily and\
    \ hourly decisions based on many sources of\ninformation including agricultural\
    \ weather networks and on-farm weather stations.\nExtensive work at the state\
    \ and regional level has been put into developing publicly accessible\nirrigation\
    \ information [10–12]. Most notably, state and regional weather networks include\
    \ automated\ncalculation of reference evapotranspiration (ETref) using the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation. Reference ET\ncan be used with calibrated crop coefﬁcients to estimate\
    \ a crop speciﬁc ET. In the Paciﬁc Northwest, the\nUS Bureau of Reclamation operates\
    \ the Agrimet network with approximately 70 agricultural weather\nstations transmitting\
    \ hourly weather and ETref data (www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet). California’s Dept.\n\
    of Water Resources operates the CIMIS network of 145 weather stations, including\
    \ spatial mapping\nof 18 statewide zones for ETref (www.cimis.water.ca.gov). Washington\
    \ State operates AgWeatherNet\nwith 172 automated stations (weather.wsu.edu).\
    \ While these networks are a valuable resource, they do\nnot account for all spatial\
    \ variability in crop development, microclimate or water availability. Neither\n\
    do they provide a simple way to account for effects of site-speciﬁc conditions\
    \ such as soil water\ncharacteristics, non-optimal irrigation, novel water management\
    \ strategies or new crop varieties for\nwhich crop coefﬁcients have not yet been\
    \ calibrated [13].\nWhen growers use scientiﬁc irrigation planning to maximize\
    \ water use efﬁciency, the beneﬁt\nof reduced water consumption can be linked\
    \ to greater risk of reduced yield or crop failure.\nUnder drought stress, plants\
    \ can limit water loss so that actual transpiration is less than potential\nevapotranspiration.\
    \ Once a crop is planted, farmers often must prioritize water allocation, deciding\n\
    which crops should receive full irrigation and when to under-irrigate. Yet these\
    \ decisions are usually\nmade without reliable information on actual ET or crop\
    \ water demand, particularly at scales that are\nrelevant to precision irrigation\
    \ systems [14]. These decisions must also be coordinated with distribution\ncapacity\
    \ and source water availability. Coordinating all of these factors in real time\
    \ is an extraordinary\nchallenge. At present, farmers who use evapotranspiration\
    \ as a basis for irrigation scheduling rely on\ndaily reference ET estimates and\
    \ single crop coefﬁcients provided with network data. Consequently,\nfarmers must\
    \ augment regional ET estimates with their personal knowledge of local weather\
    \ patterns,\ncrop water needs, microclimate and soil water storage to help plan\
    \ irrigation decisions.\nRegional agricultural weather networks are a valuable\
    \ source of information but even the\ndensest networks leave large gaps in coverage.\
    \ Local on-farm conditions may vary signiﬁcantly\nfrom those at the monitoring\
    \ site, leading some growers to construct their own on-farm weather\nstations.\
    \ Commercially available systems do provide site-speciﬁc information on weather\
    \ parameters\nbut do not necessarily have the quality of sensors of the typical\
    \ network station. Some commercial\nsystems can be accessed with smart phone interfaces\
    \ and may calculate reference ET. Another challenge\nfor using low-cost, on-farm\
    \ stations is requirement for a homogeneous, well-watered surface, which\nensures\
    \ boundary layer conditions that are representative of reference ET [13,15]. Stations\
    \ are not\nusually constructed with a reference surface because the cost of maintaining\
    \ such a site can cost more\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 108\n3 of 17\nthan the station\
    \ itself. In fact, most farm weather stations are located next to buildings or\
    \ along farm\nroads so that they do not interfere farm operations. Maintaining\
    \ a reference surface and siting the\nstation in an appropriate wind fetch are\
    \ two critical considerations that are provided at permanent\nnetwork sites but\
    \ difﬁcult to reproduce under normal farm operating conditions.\nOnce on-farm\
    \ weather data (temperature, humidity, solar radiation, precipitation, etc.) is\
    \ collected,\na set of procedures must be selected for quality control and assessment\
    \ (QAQC) and to estimate crop\nwater demand. If on-farm stations do not provide\
    \ reliable and useful information, the value of the\nstations do not justify the\
    \ cost of maintaining them. Even for cases in which advanced control systems\n\
    are used, the impact of poorly calibrated crop coefﬁcients and in-homogeneous\
    \ soil characteristics\nconfound efﬁcient irrigation scheduling [16]. Regardless\
    \ of the source, when operators attempt but fail\nto ﬁnd direct uses for weather\
    \ data in farm operations, conﬁdence in scientiﬁc methods for managing\nwater\
    \ is eroded and can severely impair collaborative efforts to manage water resources\
    \ [8]. Moreover,\nwhen on-farm weather sensors are used to determine reference\
    \ ET, crop coefﬁcients are still needed to\ndetermine actual ET and prescribe\
    \ an irrigation application rate [17]. Direct measurements of actual\nET are possible\
    \ through more laborious and costly research tools such as eddy covariance or\
    \ weighing\nlysimeters, yet these methods are usually infeasible for monitoring\
    \ water consumption in applied\nsettings. In cases when this information is most\
    \ valuable and when resources are truly scarce, such as\nwhen improving agriculture\
    \ systems in rural areas, information obtained by such methods is difﬁcult\nto\
    \ obtain or apply directly [18].\nIn order to leverage all of these techniques,\
    \ neural networks show potential to integrate different\nkinds of ET measurement\
    \ methods. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models that\nallow\
    \ computers to learn from data and approximate solutions for non-linear, multi-input\
    \ functions.\nDue to their ﬂexibility and robustness, ANNs have been widely applied\
    \ in ﬁelds ranging from\nrobotics to airplane ﬂight control [19,20]. ANNs have\
    \ seen exploratory usage in hydrology [21]\nand speciﬁcally in modelling reference\
    \ ET [22] and irrigation optimization [23]. Because neural\nnetworks use optimization\
    \ algorithms and do not depend on physical models, ANNs can be useful\nin circumstances\
    \ where data quality is variable and also to explore non-linear behaviors. Data\
    \ from\na previous ﬁeld study on crop water use was used to train an ANN to estimate\
    \ ET and examine the\nrobustness of the method in both well-watered and drought\
    \ conditions, complementing and extending\nthe Penman-Monteith equation for reference\
    \ ET [24].\nThe two central objectives of this effort are to augment the value\
    \ of on-farm weather data\nby making them more directly useful in irrigation scheduling\
    \ and to facilitate more extensive ET\nmonitoring. By co-locating eddy covariance\
    \ sensors with more readily available meteorological\nsensors, neural networks\
    \ can be employed to estimate actual ET from the same parameters typically\nused\
    \ to determine reference ET. The project is used to demonstrate that an affordable,\
    \ on-farm weather\nstation can determine site-speciﬁc ETa when co-located with\
    \ research grade sensors. Short periods of\nﬁeld data from co-located eddy covariance\
    \ and weather stations were used to ﬁrst train the neural\nnetwork to estimate\
    \ ETa. The resulting ANN estimate of ETa, based on low-cost sensor data, was\n\
    compared against the eddy-covariance data for robustness and accuracy for the\
    \ entire ﬁeld record.\nThis approach was used to (1) evaluate the minimal sensor\
    \ requirement for robust ANN; (2) determine\nthe shortest reliable training period;\
    \ (3) provide new ETa observations that can guide more efﬁcient\nirrigation. By\
    \ training for short periods with actual ET data, neural networks and simple sensors\
    \ can\nbe used to estimate actual ET. By sharing higher-cost research sensors\
    \ across multiple sites, actual\nET can be measured in many more locations than\
    \ would be possible with either eddy-covariance or\nstandard agricultural weather\
    \ networks alone.\n2. Materials and Methods\nDevelopment and validation of the\
    \ neural network method to estimate actual ET was performed\nin two phases. First,\
    \ ﬁeld studies were conducted at a center-pivot irrigated ﬁeld and at a drip irrigated\n\
    orchard using co-located standard weather stations and eddy covariance systems.\
    \ Post-season analysis\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 108\n4 of 17\nconsisted of automated\
    \ training of neural networks and subsequent determination of the shortest\nviable\
    \ training periods and the minimal number of required sensors. These determinations\
    \ were\nmade by dropping out data and comparing the resulting ET estimate to the\
    \ entire collected record for\nthat site. The resulting networks were then used\
    \ to estimate actual ET and to investigate irrigation\nperformance and crop response\
    \ at each site. The trained ET estimates were evaluated for robustness\nunder\
    \ crop water stress and in environmental conditions typically encountered under\
    \ normal farming\nconditions. These included non-optimal irrigation scheduling,\
    \ periods of heat stress, long periods of\nreduced solar radiation from wildﬁre\
    \ smoke and irrigation of crop with unknown irrigation demand\n(crop coefﬁcients).\
    \ In each case, the ANN estimate of actual ET (ETann) was compared to actual\n\
    ET determined by eddy covariance. Where applicable, ETann was also compared against\
    \ crop ET\ndetermined with crop coefﬁcients and ETref.\nData used in this study\
    \ and Matlab code implementation of the neural network analysis are\nmaintained\
    \ by the Northwest Knowledge Network in a publicly accessible database. The data\
    \ can be\nobtained with the following DOIs: www.doi.org/10.7923/7nt0-7e64 [25]\
    \ (site 1 data) and www.doi.\norg/10.7923/nnxk-8p22 [26] (site 2 data).\n2.1.\
    \ Field Experiments\nThe two experimental sites are located in irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ located in western Oregon, USA. The ﬁrst\nﬁeld site (site 1) is located in Benton\
    \ County Oregon, USA, between two ﬁelds irrigated by center\npivots. The eddy-covariance\
    \ system and weather station were sited between the two ﬁelds, adjacent\nareas\
    \ of which were planted in green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) covering 22 ha and\
    \ 29 ha in the two\nﬁelds. Eleven years of wind records were available from a\
    \ municipal airport weather station 2 km away\nfrom the measurement site. From\
    \ these data, the predominant summer wind patterns were the basis\nof siting and\
    \ orienting the weather sensors. To maximize the likelihood of reliable eddy-covariance\n\
    measurements, the measurement footprint is uniformly ﬂat, irrigated and planted\
    \ to crops for at least\n200 m (100 × the measurement height) in the direction\
    \ of the predominant day time wind direction\nand nearly as uniform for 200 m\
    \ in the directions of all other wind (night time katabatic ﬂows and\nmost common\
    \ synoptic scale weather patterns), Despite the center pivot irrigation operating\
    \ for the\nprevious four years, for the study in 2017 a consistent irrigation\
    \ schedule had not yet been established\nby the farm manager. Instead, irrigation\
    \ timing was based on visible crop stress and hand tests of soil\nmoisture; application\
    \ rates were limited by soil intake rates (personal correspondence).\nData were\
    \ collected for eight months (March–October 2017) with a variety of sensor conﬁgurations.\n\
    All data used in this analysis were collected for the entire eight-month period.\
    \ For eddy-covariance\nmeasurements, an IRGASON integrated sonic anemometer and\
    \ open path gas analyzer (Campbell\nScientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA) was mounted\
    \ at 2 m above ground level (a.g.l.) and oriented into\nthe dominant daytime wind\
    \ direction. For some 2–3 week training periods, a NR01 net radiometer\n(Hukseﬂux,\
    \ Delft, The Netherlands), HFP-01 soil heat ﬂux plate (Hukseﬂux, Delft, The Netherlands)\n\
    and two HCS2 humidity/temperature probes (Rotronic AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland)\
    \ were co-located\nwith the Q-7 net radiometer soil probes and HMP-60 thermohydrometers,\
    \ respectively. The “low-cost”\nsensor ensemble included: two humidity and temperature\
    \ sensors at two measurement heights; soil\nmoisture content temperature potential\
    \ sensors; tipping bucket rain gauges; sonic anemometers; a Q-7\nthermopile net\
    \ radiometer and a PAR quantum sensor; a cup and vane anemometer. Speciﬁc sensors\n\
    at the two sites are described in Table 1. A typical sensor array used in the\
    \ ﬁeld experiments is shown\nin Figure 1.\nA similar combined sensor system (weather\
    \ sensors and eddy covariance) was deployed at site 2 in\nsummer 2018, which was\
    \ located in Yamhill County, Oregon USA, at a 38 hectare (94 acre) drip irrigated\n\
    hazelnut (Corylus avellana) orchard. The orchard was planted in 2008, had been\
    \ irrigated since planting\nand had reached full production in 2017. The orchard\
    \ manager reported that he had applied increasing\namounts of water each year\
    \ without a clear endpoint for full irrigation and in 2018 was applying\n20 mm\
    \ (3/4 in) weekly (over three weekly applications). Irrigation is also used to\
    \ apply fertilizer\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 108\n5 of 17\n(fertigation). A ﬁeld experiment\
    \ in 2017 (exclusive of eddy covariance) provided preliminary weather\ninformation\
    \ such as predominant wind direction, which was used in siting this ﬁeld experimental.\n\
    In the summer of 2018, Site 2 was instrumented with the IRGASON eddy-covariance\
    \ system and\nsupplementary sensors. Sensors were mounted on a mast/boom system\

    \ soil heat fluxes, sensible and latent heat fluxes were \nused to evaluate closure\
    \ of the surface energy balance as a secondary estimation of uncertainty in the\
    \ \nET control measure. Periods which exceeded 20% residual were excluded from\
    \ ANN training and in \nanalysis. Limited gap filling was required for short periods\
    \ (~1 averaging period), which were \nlinearly interpolated for calculating cumulative\
    \ ET. \nThe local reference ET was also calculated for the analysis, using the\
    \ Penman-Monteith equation \n[31] based on the measured net radiation, ground\
    \ flux, air pressure, temperature humidity and wind \nspeed. ETref was used as\
    \ an approximation of potential ET for identifying time variability in irrigation\
    \ \nadequacy and to identify periods demonstrating non-linear crop responses,\
    \ that is, when ET was \nlimited by water availability rather than available energy.\
    \ ETref was also used in combination with \nsingle crop coefficients to compare\
    \ to ETann, as the single crop coefficient method is a readily available \nET\
    \ estimate used for irrigation scheduling. Where applicable, crop coefficients\
    \ were obtained from \nAgrimet [32] (https://www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet/cropcurves/crop_curves.html).\
    \ Energy balance \nclosure was used as an independent check on data quality to\
    \ ensure that eddy-covariance \nFigure 2. Photograph of experimental site 2 (Hazelnut\

    \ on a 10-m tower in background.\nRaw sensor outputs were measured and logged\
    \ with CR1000 dataloggers (Campbell Scientiﬁc).\nIRGASON data were logged at 20\
    \ Hz and all other sensors were sampled on 1 s intervals, with\n1-min averages\
    \ recorded. All Decagon sensors were sampled and recorded with a Decagon EM50\n\
    datalogger at the fastest averaging interval of 5 min. Eddy covariance provides\
    \ the control estimate\nof ETa used for ANN training. For eddy-covariance measurements,\
    \ wind speed, sonic temperature\nand water vapor density are sampled at 20 Hz.\
    \ To ensure representative ET measurements, standard\neddy-covariance corrections\
    \ and data quality procedures [27], 2-d coordinate rotations [28] and\ndensity\
    \ corrections [29] were employed. A phase space method of despiking was employed\
    \ [30].\nEddy-covariance measurements of ET were calculated for 15 to 60 min averaging\
    \ periods. The net\nradiation, soil heat ﬂuxes, sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes\
    \ were used to evaluate closure of the surface\nenergy balance as a secondary\
    \ estimation of uncertainty in the ET control measure. Periods which\nexceeded\
    \ 20% residual were excluded from ANN training and in analysis. Limited gap ﬁlling\
    \ was\nrequired for short periods (~1 averaging period), which were linearly interpolated\
    \ for calculating\ncumulative ET.\nThe local reference ET was also calculated\
    \ for the analysis, using the Penman-Monteith\nequation [31] based on the measured\
    \ net radiation, ground ﬂux, air pressure, temperature humidity\nand wind speed.\
    \ ETref was used as an approximation of potential ET for identifying time variability\
    \ in\nirrigation adequacy and to identify periods demonstrating non-linear crop\
    \ responses, that is, when\nET was limited by water availability rather than available\
    \ energy. ETref was also used in combination\nwith single crop coefﬁcients to\
    \ compare to ETann, as the single crop coefﬁcient method is a readily\navailable\
    \ ET estimate used for irrigation scheduling. Where applicable, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ were obtained\nfrom Agrimet [32] (https://www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet/cropcurves/crop_curves.html).\n\
    Energy\nbalance closure was used as an independent check on data quality to ensure\
    \ that eddy-covariance\nmeasurements were representative of actual ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ Fluxes were compared against irrigation\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 108\n7 of 17\ntiming,\
    \ soil moisture measurements and atmospheric stability. For both sites, soil moisture\
    \ and\nprecipitation gauges were installed so that irrigation and precipitation\
    \ were measured independently\n(using multiple tipping buckets), so that the total\
    \ precipitation and irrigation intercepted by the crop\nwere recorded.\n2.2. Estimating\
    \ Actual ET with Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\nOnce a time series of actual ET was\
    \ established using quality controlled eddy-covariance\nmeasurements, raw sensor\
    \ data and ET control measurements were imported and processed in\nMatlab [33].\
    \ The neural network used to estimate actual ET was implemented with MathWorks’\n\
    Neural Network Toolbox. A simple two-layer network (with one layer of 10–12 nodes\
    \ and one single\nnode output layer) was trained using the Bayesian Regularization\
    \ backpropagation algorithm, which\nis implemented with Levenberg-Marquardt optimization.\
    \ This algorithm is well suited to moderately\nsized data as is typical for the\
    \ experimental design described above. Additionally, the Bayesian\nregularization\
    \ algorithm is robust when using noisy input data [34].\nThe structure of an artiﬁcial\
    \ neural network is built of nodes (also called “neurons”); each node\nis an array\
    \ of input parameters and weighting and bias vectors control nodal input and outputs\
    \ [21].\nIn the training process, the network is adjusted by changing the functional\
    \ contribution of each\ninput parameter through assigning unique weighting and\
    \ biases at each node. The network uses\nfeedback from the control estimate (in\
    \ this case, ET measured by eddy covariance) to train functional\nrelationships.\
    \ From random initial conditions, training proceeds by iterating and minimizing\
    \ the\ndifference between the control ET measurement and ANN estimated values.\
    \ Training ceases when\na speciﬁc error level is reached, a speciﬁed number of\
    \ iterations is completed or when error decreases\nnegligibly in successive iterations.\
    \ In the Matlab toolbox, the user speciﬁes the data input, training\ndata and\
    \ algorithms for optimizing the ANN; processing occurs in an intuitive user interface\
    \ which\nalso allows for plotting results and evaluating the robustness of the\
    \ resulting solution. Every iteration\nof the ANN is randomly initialized, so\
    \ that two ANNs trained on identical data will produce slightly\ndifferent outputs.\n\
    The ﬁeld experiments were designed to evaluate the feasibility of using ANNs working\
    \ from the\nhypothesis that the most relevant information would be obtained from\
    \ sensor data related to physical\nprinciples such as conservation of energy (surface\
    \ energy budget) and turbulent ﬂux relationships.\nAccordingly, two practical\
    \ aims were proposed. The ﬁrst aim was to determine which low-cost\nsensors are\
    \ most critical for robust ET estimates and cost effective for monitoring crop\
    \ water demand.\nThe second aim was to determine the shortest training time that\
    \ is required for a valid ANN solution.\nThe motivation of these two aims are\
    \ to reduce direct costs and to extend the impact of eddy covariance\nsensors\
    \ (i.e. to train as many independent weather stations as possible).\nSensor selection\
    \ was based on a hypothesis that parameters related to the largest terms in the\n\
    surface energy budget (net radiation, sensible heat flux and soil heat flux) would\
    \ be the most important\nparameters for robust ANN solutions. Accordingly, the\
    \ field experiments included sensors for the main\ncommon meteorological parameters:\
    \ air and soil temperature, incoming and net radiation, air humidity\nand wind\
    \ speed; wind speed also may provide information about the impact of advection.\
    \ Likewise,\nadditional temperature, humidity and wind speed sensors were placed\
    \ at multiple measurement heights,\ncorresponding to the idealized flux-gradient\
    \ relationships. In addition to physics based approaches,\nnon-linear drivers\
    \ of ET such as water availability were considered. A secondary hypothesis was\
    \ that\ntime series of soil moisture, soil matric potential, precipitation and\
    \ irrigation and wind direction would\nhelp increase the skill of the trained\
    \ neural network to resolve site specific ET patterns.\nThe second aim was to\
    \ evaluate the required time to train robust ANN models.\nPrior to\nimplementation,\
    \ it was hypothesized that two weeks of training data would be sufﬁcient to reproduce\n\
    observed ETa from raw sensor data. Training periods of 1–21 days were used on\
    \ all ﬁeld data and\nthe modelled ETann results were compared to the half hour\
    \ ETa measured by eddy covariance during\nall half hour periods. The R2 and RMSE\
    \ statistics and the slope of the regression between ETa and\nAgronomy 2019, 9,\
    \ 108\n8 of 17\nETann were compared to the same statistics comparing ETa and ETref.\
    \ The slope of the regression\nline is equivalent to a single crop coefﬁcient\
    \ and it was expected to approach unity for the ANN\nmethod (a trivial result).\
    \ A successful training time was noted based on R2 and root mean square\nerror\
    \ (RMSE) comparable to those found for ETref. In other words, a successful training\
    \ period needed\nto produce a time series at least as robust as that found with\
    \ the Penman-Monteith equation, using\neddy covariance as the control measurement\
    \ of actual ET. Also, half-hour periods in which the surface\nenergy budget residual\
    \ exceeded 20% of the total available energy were excluded from training set\n\
    (but included in error analysis).\nThis project used the simplest ANN implementation\
    \ in the Matlab Machine Learning Toolbox\n(MathWorks, 2016). The ANNs employed\
    \ in this study used a single layer of 10 “hidden nodes”\nand one node in the\
    \ output layer. Training was conducted using the Levenberg-Marquardt training\n\
    algorithm, with weights and biases regularized assuming a Bayesian distribution\
    \ of these parameters.\nOther conﬁgurations were tried, including larger and smaller\
    \ numbers of nodes, layers and different\ntraining algorithms. Typically, the\
    \ simplest ANN structures performed the most reliably and a general\nstrategy\
    \ to prevent overﬁtting of the ANN model relies on limiting input parameters [35,36].\
    \ This may\nbe due to the relatively small number of input variables (relative\
    \ to typical ANN applications).\nThe workﬂow for training the neural network and\
    \ estimating ETann was as follows:\n1.\nHalf-hour mean values of each input parameter\
    \ were calculated. Time of day was determined\nfrom the data record time stamp.\
    \ In later iterations, the timing of speciﬁc irrigation events was\nused and was\
    \ calculated manually as a separate time series based on ﬁeld notes and irrigation\n\
    records and corroborated by precipitation gauge and soil moisture data.\n2.\n\
    The training period was set based on a starting date and a number of days.\n3.\n\
    The network nodes and layers were speciﬁed. Typically, this was set and an arbitrary\
    \ but small\nnumber of 10 nodes in a single hidden layer. The network also assigned\
    \ a single node output layer.\n4.\nTraining proceeded automatically using the\
    \ Matlab toolbox, with 90% of data rows in the training\nset (each half hour record\
    \ is a row) used for training and 10% used for testing. Training consists\nof\
    \ a random assignment of initial weights and biases in the hidden nodes, which\
    \ were adjusted\niteratively until the MSE between the training set and ETa (from\
    \ eddy covariance) no longer\nimproves (or until a maximum number of iterations\
    \ was reached).\n5.\nHalf-hour averages for the entire data record were then input\
    \ to the trained ANN model, which\nestimates the time series of ETann.\n6.\nTraining\
    \ was repeated for each network arrangement (number of nodes, training time, input\n\
    parameters) to evaluate hypotheses about the repeatability and robustness of ANN\
    \ ET estimates.\n2.3. Using the ANN Method to Monitor Crop Water Use: Two Case\
    \ Studies\nWhile operational estimates of daily reference ET are widely available,\
    \ the difference between\nactual and the locally calculated reference ET is inextricably\
    \ linked to potential water savings and the\npotential to incur crop water stress\
    \ [1]. The departure of actual from reference ET is a non-linear function\nand\
    \ affected by soil properties, crop drought adaptability and by water availability.\
    \ Estimates of this\ndeparture (ETref-ETa) on a daily or hourly basis provides\
    \ an objective metric of irrigation adequacy\nand can identify the site-specific\
    \ and variety-specific crop water requirement, optimize scheduling\nand evaluate\
    \ the effectiveness of irrigation strategies such as heat mitigation and deficit\
    \ irrigation.\nSupporting objectives for this study were to determine the minimum\
    \ required length of training (by\nreducing the amount of data provided for training)\
    \ and to determine which combination of sensors is\ncost-effective and robust\
    \ at estimating ET when trained (by eliminating sensors from input arrays).\n\
    3. Results\nNeural networks were successfully used to estimate actual ET at both\
    \ study sites. Results obtained\nfrom two different crops show that ANNs can be\
    \ trained on eddy-covariance data to determine ETa\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 108\n9 of\

    \ use estimates are at least\nas accurate than the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation\
    \ for well-watered crops (with known crop\ncoefﬁcients). Under drought stress\
    \ conditions or where there are no established crop coefﬁcients, the\nANN could\

    \ three days to two weeks were found in each\ncase, although other considerations\
    \ of training were shown to inﬂuence the validity of the resulting\nnetworks.\
    \ At each location, site speciﬁc considerations demonstrated the utility of the\
    \ ANN method\nto provide insights into variability in crop water use, information\
    \ which can be used directly in\nirrigation decisions.\n3.1. Optimization of ANN\

    \ of ETa by matching the accessibility \nof low-cost sensors with the accuracy\
    \ of direct research methods. By estimating ETa directly, rather \nthan relying\
    \ on distant weather data and assuming a uniform crop coefficient, site-specific\
    \ results of \nirrigation practices can be evaluated in real time.  The measured\
    \ rate of consumptive water use can \nthen be used to optimize water allocation\
    \ and irrigation schedules. For crops that do not have \nestablished crop coefficients\
    \ (such as hazelnuts), direct monitoring of actual ET provides an accurate \n\
    estimate of irrigation demand. Time series of ETa allow for improved water use\
    \ efficiency and can \nalso detect crop water stress that may be related to soil\
    \ water availability, temperature stress and \nother non-linear crop responses.\
    \ While causal environmental factors are not necessary revealed by \nthe ANN method,\
    \ the ability to monitor actual ET directly provides actionable information to\
    \ guide \nirrigation allocation.  \nBecause the training process is relatively\
    \ robust but obscures the underlying physical processes \ndriving ET, implementation\
    \ of the ANN method requires complementary qualitative and \nquantitative training\
    \ supervision. Under applied monitoring conditions, long term co-location of the\
    \ \ncontrol measure, by definition, is not available to evaluate the accuracy\
    \ of the resulting ANN \nestimates. As a result, numerical training methods must\
    \ be complemented by observational \nevaluation that the environmental conditions\
    \ used for training reflect the overall conditions for the \nentire monitoring\
    \ period.  Alternately, training must occur over a broad range of conditions.\
    \  This \nmay imply repeated, shorter (<1 week) training periods that occur during\
    \ different parts of the \ngrowing season (e.g., crop development phases, various\
    \ weather conditions and different irrigation \nrates). While it costs relatively\
    \ little to build a local weather station or to develop an ANN model and \nvalidate\

    \ could potentially reduce the cost further, although these were\nnot evaluated\
    \ in this study. And the ANN method is certainly applicable with typical commercial\n\
    weather stations that are marketed to farmers.\nThe second goal to determine the\
    \ required length of training period requires further study. It is\nclear that\
    \ the ANN method presented here is only able to reproduce actual ET for periods\
    \ that resemble\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 108\n15 of 17\nthe training period. As a result,\
    \ this requires human supervision to match the timing of training to\nweather,\
    \ irrigation and ﬁeld conditions. For established operations or crops with long\
    \ growing seasons,\nthis would not be a major impediment. On the other hand, the\
    \ relatively short period of one week,\nstrategically timed, should allow an accurate\
    \ ANN model to be developed for site speciﬁc conditions.\nGiven a total growing\
    \ season of 20–30 weeks in temperate regions (for a variety of crops), a shared\n\
    eddy covariance system could service a large number of weather stations each season,\
    \ potentially\nmaking the ~20,000 USD cost for such a system a worthwhile investment\
    \ for an irrigation district,\nextension service or crop consultant.\nIn addition\
    \ to expanded long term ﬁeld trials using the ANN method, further work on the\n\
    application of ANNs to measure ET have been identiﬁed. The ANN method developed\
    \ in Matlab’s\nNeural Network toolbox requires access to expensive and complex\
    \ software; porting this approach\nto various open source computational toolboxes/libraries\
    \ such as existing Python toolboxes [38,39]\nwould allow for much broader access.\
    \ Using the ANN method with very low-cost sensors such as the\nLEMS system [37]\
    \ would also make this method more affordable for in ﬁeld monitoring. Finally,\
    \ using\nthe ANN method to utilize agricultural weather networks would facilitate\
    \ new uses for this valuable,\npublicly available data, with speciﬁc applications\
    \ such as validation of remote sensing [40], spatial\ninterpolation of reference\
    \ ET [41] and determination of crop coefﬁcients for new crops.\nEfﬁcient irrigation\
    \ depends on matching application rates to the crop water requirement. Precision\n\
    irrigation systems also require localized crop water use. Irrigators have many\
    \ resources to estimate ETa\nand crop water use but available weather monitoring\
    \ data have limited ability to estimate real-time,\nsite-speciﬁc ET. Local and\
    \ real-time ET estimates offer the precision required for science based irrigation\n\
    to improve allocation decisions and overall efﬁciency. The ANN method is demonstrably\
    \ able to\nconvert data from low-cost sensors into site-speciﬁc ETa estimates.\
    \ Ongoing research will develop\nANNs to incorporate other forms of low-cost inputs,\
    \ such as data from weather networks, satellite\nimagery and qualitative site\
    \ observations and manual farm record-keeping. The resulting site-speciﬁc\nalgorithms\
    \ should allow growers to obtain reliable, site-speciﬁc ETa estimates affordably\
    \ and lead to\nmore efﬁcient and reliable irrigation systems.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ detection can help precision irrigation management and minimize\nyield loss.\
    \ A two-year study was conducted on non-invasive winter wheat water stress monitoring\n\
    using state-of-the-art computer vision and thermal-RGB imagery inputs. Field treatment\
    \ plots were\nirrigated using two irrigation systems (ﬂood and sprinkler) at four\
    \ rates (100, 75, 50, and 25% of crop\nevapotranspiration [ETc]). A total of 3200\
    \ images under different treatments were captured at critical\ngrowth stages,\
    \ that is, 20, 35, 70, 95, and 108 days after sowing using a custom-developed\
    \ thermal-\nRGB imaging system. Crop and soil response measurements of canopy\
    \ temperature (Tc), relative\nwater content (RWC), soil moisture content (SMC),\
    \ and relative humidity (RH) were signiﬁcantly\naffected by the irrigation treatments\
    \ showing the lowest Tc (22.5 ± 2 ◦C), and highest RWC (90%)\nand SMC (25.7 ±\
    \ 2.2%) for 100% ETc, and highest Tc (28 ± 3 ◦C), and lowest RWC (74%) and SMC\n\
    (20.5 ± 3.1%) for 25% ETc. The RGB and thermal imagery were then used as inputs\
    \ to feature-\nextraction-based deep learning models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception\
    \ V3, MobileNet V2, ResNet50)\nwhile, RWC, SMC, Tc, and RH were the inputs to\
    \ function-approximation models (Artiﬁcial Neural\nNetwork (ANN), Kernel Nearest\
    \ Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) and\
    \ Long Short-Term Memory (DL-LSTM)) to classify stressed/non-stressed crops. Among\n\
    the feature extraction-based models, ResNet50 outperformed other models showing\
    \ a discriminant\naccuracy of 96.9% with RGB and 98.4% with thermal imagery inputs.\
    \ Overall, classiﬁcation accuracy\nwas higher for thermal imagery compared to\
    \ RGB imagery inputs. The DL-LSTM had the highest\ndiscriminant accuracy of 96.7%\
    \ and less error among the function approximation-based models for\nclassifying\
    \ stress/non-stress. The study suggests that computer vision coupled with thermal-RGB\n\
    imagery can be instrumental in high-throughput mitigation and management of crop\
    \ water stress.\nKeywords: winter wheat; crop water stress; canopy temperature;\
    \ computer vision; irrigation\nmanagement\n1. Introduction\nWater stress forces\
    \ leaf stomata closure, which reduces transpiration and increases\ncanopy temperature\
    \ (Tc) [1]. Timely estimation of those stressors may not only help preci-\nsion\
    \ irrigation management but also minimize yield losses [2]. The penalty gap between\n\
    actual and potential yield will widen further as a result of climate change that\
    \ projects\na decline in rainfall frequency, and rising ambient temperatures [3].\
    \ Water stress is typ-\nically assessed using xylem water potentials [4], canopy\
    \ thermometry [5], and stomatal\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11233344\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n2 of 21\nconductance\
    \ measurements [6]. However, these methods are often invasive and tend\nto have\
    \ limited sampling accuracy due to low throughput or point data acquisitions [7].\n\
    Non-invasive proximal or remote sensing techniques have emerged as high throughput\n\
    alternatives for monitoring crop water stress through color features, reﬂectance,\
    \ and ther-\nmal emissivity of the vegetable, fruit, and specialty crops [8–10].\
    \ However, monitoring\ncrop water content using visible-range RGB imaging not\
    \ only requires speciﬁc leaf ori-\nentation relative to the camera but also pre-deﬁned\
    \ illumination conditions. This limits\nthe applicability of RGB imaging to determine\
    \ water content in ﬁeld conditions. Using\nscanner-type imaging devices could\
    \ be a cost and time-effective alternative [11]. Unlike\nthermometry, Tc from\
    \ thermal infrared imagery reﬂects upon the entire canopy emissivity\nproﬁle,\
    \ which is directly proportional to the canopy water content [9]. Thermal imagery\n\
    (8000–14,000 nm) also outperforms color RGB imagery (400–700 nm), and reﬂectance\
    \ char-\nacteristics in terms of robustness to characterize crop water stress\
    \ [8,9]. Nonetheless, the\nadaptability of thermal imaging in agricultural production\
    \ management is still at a nascent\nstage and is consistently evolving to maintain\
    \ imaging quality against drastic variations\nin relative humidity and wind speeds.\
    \ Thermal imaging cameras are also relatively more\nexpensive than simple-to-operate\
    \ RGB cameras. It is for these reasons; thermal imaging\nis still limitedly adopted\
    \ as a golden standard for crop stress mapping. Above all, long-\nwave infrared\
    \ wavelengths (thermal imaging) have a higher penetrating capability over\nvisible-range\
    \ wavelengths, making them more reliable and sensitive to crop water content\n\
    variations. Thermal imaging is therefore a better alternative for precision irrigation\
    \ man-\nagement unlike RGB imaging or using standard crop coefﬁcients coupled\
    \ with reference\nevapotranspiration [8,9].\nRGB imagery has been used to assess\
    \ crop water stress using different deep learning\n(DL) and machine learning (ML)\
    \ techniques [10,12,13]. ML techniques derive unique\nfeatures from input and\
    \ output datasets, which could be used for discrimination between\ndifferent object\
    \ types or classes. ML techniques such as Naïve Bayes, artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks\
    \ (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RFs) have been\nwidely\
    \ used with RGB images for weed detection, biotic and abiotic stress identiﬁcation\n\
    and/or classiﬁcation, yield predictions, and other crop phenotyping applications\
    \ [14,15].\nThermal imagery has also been used with RFs and decision trees for\
    \ crop water status\nmonitoring in the vineyard and automated irrigation scheduling\
    \ [16]. However, there are\nseveral limitations associated with ML techniques.\
    \ The output quality is highly dependent\non input data quality, the presence\
    \ of noise and outliers, and other unaccounted biases\nthat have been reported\
    \ to signiﬁcantly affect the model performance. Furthermore, ML\ntechniques also\
    \ require skilled operators [17] for deﬁning input features that may also often\n\
    affect the model performances through unintentional subjectivity and bias [10,12].\n\
    DL has emerged as an advanced vision-based learning technique that enables au-\n\
    tomated feature extraction without human dependencies unlike ML [18]. Pertinent\
    \ to\nagricultural applications, crop phenological stages have been detected using\
    \ a deep con-\nvolution neural network (DCNN) trained on RGB imagery [19,20].\
    \ Similarly, different DL\ntechniques (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and Inception V3) have\
    \ also been used to classify non-\nstressed and water-stressed soybean, maize,\
    \ and okra crops with digital RGB images [10].\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM)\
    \ is a novel DL approach (DL-LSTM) that has been used\nfor different ﬁeld applications\
    \ like time series forecasting of wheat yield and productiv-\nity [21], irrigation\
    \ requirement [22], predicting agricultural product sale volumes based\non seasonal\
    \ and historical data [23], and identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of weeds [24].\n\
    Most of the image processing studies have used RGB images (or visible range imagery)\
    \ to\nclassify crop water stress [25,26]. Thermal imagery has been reported to\
    \ be more robust\nfor crop water stress characterization compared to RGB or multispectral\
    \ imagery [27,28].\nThis is majorly due to the fact that the canopy emissivity\
    \ can be highly sensitive to water\ncontent [8,9,29,30].\nSo far, crop water stress\
    \ characterization has been carried out through traditional\nand destructive methods\
    \ that often have restricted commercial applicability. Moreover,\nPlants 2022,\
    \ 11, 3344\n3 of 21\nthese techniques have been limitedly explored using robust\
    \ computer-vision techniques\n(ML or DL models) for thermal infrared imagery inputs.\
    \ Small unmanned aerial system\n(UAS)-based thermal and multispectral remote sensing\
    \ is also being explored for high\nthroughput crop water stress phenotyping. However,\
    \ the frequency of data acquisition\nis limited to once or a few times a day and\
    \ atmospheric interferences including weather\nconditions may severely impact\
    \ the quality of thermal imaging. Additionally, onboard\ndata processing potential\
    \ for complex and robust algorithms is still limited for small UASs.\nContrarily,\
    \ proximal thermal imaging is subjected to the least atmospheric interference\n\
    and imaging frequency constraints. These systems can continuously collect data\
    \ at critical\ngrowth stages and also offer ﬂexibility for custom modiﬁcation\
    \ to implement onboard edge\nprocessing algorithms for real-time decision support\
    \ and management actuation. On the\ncost side, thermal and RGB imaging sensors\
    \ and the UASs are still far more expensive than\nthe proximal imaging systems,\
    \ which can be custom-assembled using miniature sensing\nmodules. However, such\
    \ miniature sensing modules neither offer sufﬁcient resolution nor\ndesired image\
    \ quality when integrated with UASs.\nObtaining robust data handling and the analytical\
    \ pipeline is the major obstacle to\nderiving real-time decision support for crop\
    \ management but is achievable using custom-\nassembled edge devices. This study\
    \ is a step toward alleviating those obstacles and\nfocuses on the evaluation\
    \ of non-invasive and cost-effective thermal-RGB imaging with\nrobust ML and DL\
    \ models for stress characterization in winter wheat crops. This could\nbe critical\
    \ from a precision irrigation scheduling and management perspective and may\n\
    potentially have high grower adaptability. Speciﬁc objectives for this two-year\
    \ study were\nto (a) non-invasively assess the crop responses to two irrigation\
    \ systems and four deﬁcit\nirrigation treatments, and (b) identify the water-stressed\
    \ and non-stressed crops by feature\nextraction using thermal-RGB imagery and\
    \ function approximation approaches using crop\nphysiological parameters and ambient\
    \ weather inputs.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Experiment Design\nWinter wheat\
    \ (Triticum aestivum L., cv. HI 1544) was planted (November to April,\n2019–2020,\
    \ and 2020–2021) in the research farm (77.24◦ E, 23.18◦ N) of the Central Institute\n\
    of Agricultural Engineering (CIAE), ICAR Bhopal, India (Figure 1). The meteorological\n\
    data are being recorded at the institute observatory since 1985. According to\
    \ Koppen’s\nclassiﬁcation (1934), Bhopal is a Mediterranean climatic zone with\
    \ an average annual\nrainfall of about 1127 mm. The soil type is heavy clay (Vertisols)\
    \ with clay content over 50%\nand moderate fertility with negligible salinity.\
    \ Soil structure is sub-angular blocky with a\nﬁeld capacity of 29.5–32% (db)\
    \ and wilting point of 18-19.5% (db). The average inﬁltration\nand percolation\
    \ rates of the soil are 10–12 mm day−1 and 6.3–7.0%, respectively. The plots\n\
    were irrigated using ﬂood and sprinkler systems at four treatment rates: 100,\
    \ 75, 50, and\n25% of full crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Micro sprinklers of\
    \ 120 lph discharge capacity\n(Make: Netaﬁm) were installed at 3.5 m spacing.\
    \ The reference crop evapotranspiration was\ncalculated using weather data with\
    \ the FAO56 Penman–Montieth method and standard\nnon-stressed crop coefﬁcient\
    \ [31]. The seasonal ETc of wheat during the ﬁrst and second\nyears of growth\
    \ was 380 mm and 345 mm, respectively. The application efﬁciencies of\n0.65 for\
    \ ﬂood irrigation and 0.90 for sprinkler irrigation were used as determined from\n\
    the experiment trials on the same site using the measurements of water applied\
    \ and the\nwater retained in the crop root zone. A total of six irrigation cycles\
    \ were implemented for\n100% ETc treatment (non-stressed) at sowing, crown root\
    \ initiation (CRI), tillering, booting,\nﬂowering, and grain ﬁlling stages. One\
    \ to three irrigation cycles were implemented for\ndeﬁcit treatments (75, 50,\
    \ and 25% of ETc) at jointing, booting, and ﬂowering stages.\nPlants 2022, 11,\

    Two different approaches (1) feature extraction-based (DL models: AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\n\
    Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet50) and (2) function approximation-based\
    \ ML\nmodels (Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support\
    \ vector\nmachine (SVM), and Logistic regression (LR)); and a DL model (DL-LSTM)\
    \ were adopted\nfor crop water stress classiﬁcation. Feature extraction-based\
    \ models were trained on thermal\nas well as RGB imagery. Function approximation-based\
    \ models were trained on ambient\nweather and soil parameters, and Tc inputs from\
    \ thermal imagery.\nDeep CNNs typically have complex architecture and some may\
    \ require signiﬁcant\ncomputational resources. All CNN model training and validation\
    \ processes were performed\non a desktop computer (Intel Core I7 Processor with\
    \ base frequency 2.60 GHz, 16 GB RAM,\n6 GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU) with\
    \ Windows 10 operating system (64 bits).\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n6 of 21\nCNN\
    \ models were developed in MATLAB 2019b using the deep learning and machine\n\
    learning toolbox. All the models are detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\
    2.3.1. Feature Extraction-Based Approaches\nFive DL models were selected as the\
    \ feature extraction-based approaches (1) AlexNet;\n(2) GoogLeNet; (3) Inception\
    \ V3; (4) MobileNet V2; and (5) ResNet50. These models were se-\nlected for their\
    \ extraordinary capabilities of automated feature extraction, easy and efﬁcient\n\
    training of the raw images with optimum computation resources, and their transferability\n\
    to edge computation devices [10,17]. The selected models ranged from the simplest\
    \ architec-\nture (AlexNet and MobileNet V2) to the most complex architecture\
    \ (GoogLeNet, Inception\nV3, and ResNet50) in order to evaluate their robustness\
    \ and efﬁciencies for crop water stress\nprediction. Successful application of\
    \ these models has been reported with accuracies up to\n100% for crop abiotic\
    \ and biotic stress classiﬁcation in recent studies [35–37]. Standardized\narchitectures\
    \ were used in the models for performance comparisons (Table 1).\nTable 1. Architecture\

    The DL-based classification includes steps of pre-trained model selection, data\
    \ pre-\nprocessing using morphological operators, data splitting, setting the\
    \ training hyper-parameters,\nmodel training, model tuning, cross-validation,\
    \ evaluation, and model testing (Figure 3).\nDL models were developed in MATLAB\
    \ (version 2019a, Mathworks, Natick, Boston, MA,\nUSA) using libraries of AlexNet,\
    \ GoogLeNet, Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet50.\nThe convolutional kernels\
    \ in AlexNet were extracted using the cost function optimized by\na stochastic\
    \ gradient descent with momentum (Sgdm) algorithm. While GoogLeNet pro-\ncesses\
    \ and classiﬁes images by alternately factorizing the convolutions and regularization\n\
    layers. To train a GoogLeNet model, the model’s loss 3-classiﬁer, prob, and output\
    \ layers\nwere replaced by fully connected, softmax and output class layers which\
    \ connected with\nother traditional layers. The inception V3 extracted (a) local\
    \ features of the stressed crop by\nusing small convolutions and (b) high abstracted\
    \ features with large convolutions. The last\nthree prediction layers in inception\
    \ V3 were replaced by three new layers; fully connected,\nsoftmax, and classiﬁcation\
    \ output layer. These layers were interconnected with average\npooling and a fully\
    \ connected layer of the pre-trained DL. MobileNet V2 and ResNet50 are\nthe very\
    \ recently proposed DL models for classiﬁcation problems. MobileNet V2 requires\n\
    less computational power compared to conventional CNN. ResNet50 is a deep residual\n\
    network that uses the shortcut connections by reducing the convolutional layers\
    \ and by\nalso solving the vanishing gradient issue typical to CNN. The residual\
    \ modules in ResNet50\nwere used to connect different layers of CNN to improve\
    \ the model performance [38].\nGeneralization can be poor for feature extraction-based\
    \ models when the number of\nepochs and batch sizes are more than the optimum\
    \ [39]. This is because the model can\noverlearn when trained on a speciﬁc dataset\
    \ at large epochs and batch sizes, and may lose\nits performance and generalization\
    \ capability when trained on new datasets. Conversely,\nthe smaller epochs and\
    \ bath sizes may lead to insufﬁcient learning and underﬁtting of the\nmodel and\
    \ hence may not perform as expected with the new datasets [40]. Therefore, to\n\

    \ Function Approximation-Based Approaches\nFour ML models; ANN, KNN, LR, and SVM\
    \ and a DL-based LSTM (DL-LSTM) were\nselected as the function approximation approaches\
    \ for crop water stress classiﬁcation. The\nML models were selected as those provide\
    \ an opportunity to analyze numerous features\nsimultaneously unlike traditional\
    \ methods. ANN is effective in learning complex nonlinear\nfunctions and segmenting\
    \ data based on the learned weights. The input layer had four\nvariables to extract\
    \ features from 1600 samples while the output layer had one neuron to\ncalculate\
    \ the probability of each class [47]. KNN classiﬁes a data point based on its\
    \ distance\nfrom the maximum number of training data points in the neighborhood.\
    \ Typically, KNN\nuses Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, or Hamming distances out\
    \ of which Minkowski\ndistance has been reported to be more reliable [48] and\
    \ was therefore selected in the model.\nLR classiﬁes data points into discrete\
    \ classes based on probability using a sigmoid or logistic\nfunction [49]. SVM\
    \ shifts data points to a higher dimension using linear, non-linear, and\nradial\
    \ kernels to achieve linear separability [50] and then identiﬁes a hyperplane\
    \ for the\nhighest possible distance between data points of the two classes. DL-LSTM\
    \ uses a chain of\nrepeated modules comprising memory cells with a backpropagation\
    \ algorithm to solve the\nclassiﬁcation problems. This model solves premature\
    \ overﬁtting and vanishing gradient\nissues by using the previously stored information\
    \ in the memory cell. The information\nis then used to generate the features during\
    \ the training process to predict the output\nclass [51]. ML models automatically\
    \ tuned their hyperparameter values by using Bayesian\noptimization. The optimization\
    \ minimizes the model loss based on the hyperparameter\ncombination and yields\
    \ the best possible set of parameters. Further, the models were\ntrained and validated\
    \ on these tuned hyperparameters. All function-approximation models\nwere deployed\
    \ on crop environment (Ta, RH, and SMC) and temperature (Tc, from thermal\nimages)\
    \ inputs for classiﬁcation into stressed and non-stressed through binary outputs\
    \ (0\nor 1, Table 3). The models (operating parameters in Table 4) were developed\

    \ of both feature extraction and function approximation-based models\nwas evaluated\
    \ through accuracy (A), sensitivity (Se), speciﬁcity (Sp), precision (P), and\
    \ F1\nscore parameters (Equations (1)–(5)). Accuracy is the correct prediction\
    \ rate of non-stressed\nand stressed crops, precision is the fraction of true\
    \ positive (TS) or correctly predicted\nstressed crop from an overall prediction\
    \ of the stressed crop (PS), speciﬁcity is the true\nnegative (TN) or correctly\
    \ predicted non-stressed crops from the actual non-stressed crops\n(AN). Sensitivity\
    \ represents a fraction of the correctly predicted stressed crops (TS) from the\n\
    actual stressed crops (AS) and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision\
    \ and sensitivity.\nThe F1 score evaluates the accuracy of a binary classiﬁcation\
    \ problem as in this study, which\naims to classify the crops into two classes\
    \ (stressed and non-stressed). Often, the accuracy\nestimate is affected by true\
    \ negatives and therefore F1 score is highly used over accuracy to\nseek a balance\
    \ between the precision and recall (sensitivity) parameters and when there is\n\
    an uneven class distribution (a large number of actual negatives).\nA = TS + TN\n\

    \ was rep-\nresented by type1 (TE1) (false positive) and type2 errors (TE2) (false\
    \ negative). TE1 is the\nnumber of actual stressed crops misclassiﬁed as non-stressed\
    \ (row 1-column 2 of the confu-\nsion matrix) while TE2 is the number of actual\
    \ non-stressed crops misclassiﬁed as stressed\n(row 2-column 1 of the confusion\

    \ Stress Prediction\n3.2.1. Feature Extraction-Based Approaches\nThe performances\
    \ of AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet50\nmodels for\
    \ RGB and thermal imagery were tested for different combinations of epochs\nand\
    \ batch sizes (Table 5). The model training accuracies increased with the increase\
    \ in\nthe number of epochs from 5 to 10 and over-ﬁtting was observed for all the\
    \ models when\nepochs increased to 20. Over different epochs, accuracy increased\
    \ with the increase in\nbatch size from 5 to 20. For the batch size of 20 and\
    \ 250 iterations, overﬁtting was observed\nin Inception and ResNet50 with RGB\
    \ imagery inputs and in AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and\nResNet50 with thermal imagery\
    \ inputs (Table 5). Extensive hyperparameter tuning was\nperformed with parameters\
    \ listed in Table 2 to minimize overﬁtting and maximize the\nmodel accuracies.\
    \ Post-tuning, the maximum training accuracies of 94.6%, 96.7%, and 95.6%\nwere\
    \ observed for AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet V2, respectively with RGB imagery\n\
    inputs at 10 epochs and batch size of 20 (Figure 5). While the Inception V3 and\
    \ ResNet50\nfor RGB imagery inputs converged at 10 epochs, batch size of 15, and\
    \ 300 iterations with\nrespective accuracies of 92.7% and 97.1% (Figure 5c,e).\
    \ For the thermal imagery inputs, the\noptimum hyperparameters were 10 epochs\
    \ and a batch size of 15, which yielded maximum\naccuracies of 96.4%, 97.2%, and\
    \ 98.5% for AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50, respectively.\nFurthermore, 10 epochs\
    \ and a batch size of 20 were found optimum for Inception V3\nand MobileNet V2\
    \ models, and pertinent maximum accuracies were 98.0% and 95.3%,\nrespectively\
    \ (Figure 6). During hyperparameter tuning, the model overﬁtting reduced\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ at 10 epochs without sacriﬁcing accuracy. The training accuracies fell below\n\
    50% for learning rates of 1 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−4 and went over 50% for the learning\
    \ rate of\n3 × 10−4. Moreover, the model overﬁtting was reduced when the solver\
    \ was shifted from\nSgdm to Adam. All the models converged with training accuracies\
    \ > 90% at the learning\nrate of 3 × 10−4 and Adam as the solver (Figures 5 and\
    \ 6).\nTable 5. Training accuracies of feature extraction-based models to characterize\

    \ of water and wets the entire \ncanopy, unlike traditional flood irrigation.\
    \ This cools down the microclimate and in-\ncreases relative air humidity to reduce\
    \ the microclimate’s water demand [52]. This could \nbe the reason for lower Tc\
    \ in all the sprinkler irrigation treatments compared to the cor-\nresponding\
    \ flood irrigation treatments (Figure 4). Lowered microclimate water demand \n\
    could have also resulted in lower soil moisture depletion from the root zone and\
    \ there-\nfore higher SMC with sprinkler irrigation [53]. In addition to sufficient\
    \ SMC, sprinkler \nirrigation results in lower deep percolation and nutrient leaching\
    \ compared to conven-\ntional flood irrigation [54–56]. This could have resulted\
    \ in a higher average yield for \nsprinkler irrigation treatment plots (5719 kg/ha)\
    \ compared to the flood irrigation treat-\nment plots (4898 kg/ha). With the projected\
    \ future climate change impacts in the form of \nlow rainfall frequencies and\
    \ high ambient temperatures, crop water stresses are further \nexpected to multiply,\
    \ which will multiply the penalties in yield potentials [3]. Therefore, \nstress-tolerant\
    \ crop cultivars need to be developed and planted for uncompromised yield \ngoals.\
    \ As also reported in our prior work based on canopy reflectance [57], water stress\
    \ \nstarted to occur before the CRI stage in both methods of irrigation. RWCs\
    \ were lower at \nlate jointing and flowering stages in case of flood irrigation.\
    \ Water stress at the flowering \nstage can result in significant yield and biomass\
    \ reductions [58] suggesting that it is also \ninfluenced by the phenological\
    \ growth stage. For robust analysis of this aspect, large \ndatasets are being\
    \ collected at each phenological growth stage. Water stress lowers CO2 \navailability\
    \ due to stomatal closure, thereby affecting photosynthesis and ultimately \n\
    growth, yield, and biomass [59,60]. \nCNNs have been increasingly used for plant\
    \ phenotyping applications over the past \ndecade for their capability of modeling\
    \ complicated plant processes by distinguishing \nand extracting regularized data\
    \ patterns [61,62]. It is for this reason; CNN models were \nhighly accurate in\
    \ predicting stressed and non-stressed crops using thermal and RGB \nimagery.\
    \ Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, while carotenoids are critical \nnon-enzymatic\
    \ antioxidants. Water stress reduces chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, \nas\
    \ well as the ratio of chlorophyll ‘a’ to ‘b’, leading to leaf coloration changes.\
    \ This is the \nreason for RGB images also yielding satisfactory accuracy of up\
    \ to 94.6% for tracing leaf \ncolor changes [63]. Compared to RGB imagery, thermal\
    \ imagery is a more detailed and \nbetter presenter of the crop stress that alters\
    \ the emissivity patterns proportionally \n[64,65]. The canopy temperature is\
    \ affected by the microclimate conditions and the \navailable soil moisture [53].\
    \ This is the reason for the relatively lower accuracy of water \nstress detection\
    \ with RGB images (94.6%) than with thermal images (96.7%) irrespective \nFigure\

    \ classes.\n4. Discussion\nSprinkler irrigation applies a predetermined quantity\
    \ of water and wets the entire\ncanopy, unlike traditional ﬂood irrigation. This\
    \ cools down the microclimate and increases\nrelative air humidity to reduce the\
    \ microclimate’s water demand [52]. This could be the\nreason for lower Tc in\
    \ all the sprinkler irrigation treatments compared to the corresponding\nﬂood\
    \ irrigation treatments (Figure 4). Lowered microclimate water demand could have\n\
    also resulted in lower soil moisture depletion from the root zone and therefore\
    \ higher\nSMC with sprinkler irrigation [53]. In addition to sufﬁcient SMC, sprinkler\
    \ irrigation\nresults in lower deep percolation and nutrient leaching compared\
    \ to conventional ﬂood\nirrigation [54–56]. This could have resulted in a higher\
    \ average yield for sprinkler irrigation\ntreatment plots (5719 kg/ha) compared\
    \ to the ﬂood irrigation treatment plots (4898 kg/ha).\nWith the projected future\
    \ climate change impacts in the form of low rainfall frequencies\nand high ambient\
    \ temperatures, crop water stresses are further expected to multiply, which\n\
    will multiply the penalties in yield potentials [3]. Therefore, stress-tolerant\
    \ crop cultivars\nneed to be developed and planted for uncompromised yield goals.\
    \ As also reported in\nour prior work based on canopy reﬂectance [57], water stress\
    \ started to occur before the\nCRI stage in both methods of irrigation. RWCs were\
    \ lower at late jointing and ﬂowering\nstages in case of ﬂood irrigation. Water\
    \ stress at the ﬂowering stage can result in signiﬁcant\nyield and biomass reductions\
    \ [58] suggesting that it is also inﬂuenced by the phenological\ngrowth stage.\
    \ For robust analysis of this aspect, large datasets are being collected at each\n\
    phenological growth stage. Water stress lowers CO2 availability due to stomatal\
    \ closure,\nthereby affecting photosynthesis and ultimately growth, yield, and\
    \ biomass [59,60].\nCNNs have been increasingly used for plant phenotyping applications\
    \ over the past\ndecade for their capability of modeling complicated plant processes\
    \ by distinguishing and\nextracting regularized data patterns [61,62]. It is for\
    \ this reason; CNN models were highly\naccurate in predicting stressed and non-stressed\
    \ crops using thermal and RGB imagery.\nChlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis,\
    \ while carotenoids are critical non-enzymatic an-\ntioxidants. Water stress reduces\
    \ chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, as well as the ratio\nof chlorophyll ‘a’\
    \ to ‘b’, leading to leaf coloration changes. This is the reason for RGB\nimages\
    \ also yielding satisfactory accuracy of up to 94.6% for tracing leaf color changes\
    \ [63].\nCompared to RGB imagery, thermal imagery is a more detailed and better\
    \ presenter of the\ncrop stress that alters the emissivity patterns proportionally\
    \ [64,65]. The canopy tempera-\nture is affected by the microclimate conditions\
    \ and the available soil moisture [53]. This\nis the reason for the relatively\
    \ lower accuracy of water stress detection with RGB images\n(94.6%) than with\
    \ thermal images (96.7%) irrespective of the selected DL models (Table 5).\nA\
    \ similar observation is reported in a prior study [64] where higher accuracy\
    \ was obtained\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n16 of 21\nwith thermal imagery (89%) compared\
    \ to RGB imagery (82%) for wheat ear counting using\nDCNN models. Since thermal\
    \ imaging is often affected by the wind or RH factors of the\nenvironment, the\
    \ quality of data will be critical for training the DL models, especially when\n\
    acquired using aerial platforms [30,64]. Therefore, to maintain thermal data quality,\
    \ imag-\ning campaigns were launched when wind velocities were below 5 kmph. The\
    \ ResNet50\nhad relatively the highest accuracy among the feature extraction models.\
    \ Although it\nis the basic version of GoogLeNet and Inception V3, the performance\
    \ would be highly\nimpacted by the quality of input imagery, size, and robustness\
    \ of the dataset, especially\nfor the agricultural environments. ResNet50 addresses\
    \ the neural network degradation\nproblem by introducing identity mapping, which\
    \ results in the disappearance of gradient\nparameters and the non-ideal convergence\
    \ effect on the deeper networks [66,67]. This fea-\nture contributed to the enhanced\
    \ performance of ResNet50 compared to the other models\nthereby suggesting the\
    \ suitability of ResNet50 for agricultural applications for various\ncrop biotic\
    \ and abiotic stress characterizations. CNN models were also applied to thermal\n\
    imagery for water stress classiﬁcation in maize under well-irrigated, moderately\
    \ irrigated,\nand water-stressed treatments, obtaining an overall accuracy of\
    \ 89% [68]. Color and grey\nimages of maize were also used as inputs to the DCNN\
    \ model for water stress identiﬁcation\nwhere stress identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracies were 98% and 95%, respectively [26].\nThe inception-ResNet V2 framework\
    \ utilized for water stress identiﬁcation in sugarcane\nyielded an accuracy of\
    \ 83% with available soil water capacity as input [65]. Thus far, most\nof the\
    \ computer vision models have utilized single-dimensional data inputs, unlike\
    \ this\nstudy which advances water-stress identiﬁcation in wheat crops using multidimensional\n\
    data inputs. Multidimensional data modeling enhances the robustness and applicability\
    \ of\ndeveloped approaches across various agroclimatic conditions.\nCrop growth\
    \ or its water stress response is not necessarily linear to the weather or\nsoil\
    \ conditions [69]. Therefore, the linear (LR) and non-linear function approximation\n\
    approaches (ANN, KNN, SVM, and DL-LSTM) were evaluated to predict the stress class\
    \ of\nthe crop. ANN and SVM had a better stress prediction accuracy (Table 6)\
    \ compared to KNN\nand LR possibly due to two reasons (1) KNN or LR either use\
    \ locally linear segments or a\ngeneralized linear approach for making predictions\
    \ [66,69] and (2) KNN and LR models\ntrain on an unsupervised learning approach,\
    \ unlike ANN and SVM, which train on a\nsupervised learning approach [18]. ANN\
    \ and SVM had comparable accuracies for crop\nstress prediction. However, SVM\
    \ suits small datasets; while ANN can process relatively\nlarger datasets. Therefore,\
    \ ANN would have more conﬁdence in prediction classes.\nCrop phenotyping with\
    \ traditional function approximation approaches (ML mod-\nels) is often subjective\
    \ compared to the advanced DL-LSTM approach as those require\nmanual feature selection\
    \ of Tc, Ta, RH, and SMC. This restricts the robustness and accu-\nracy of the\
    \ ML models. Therefore, DL-LSTM outperformed the traditional ML models\n(Figure\
    \ 9) due to its automated and stabilized feature selection advantage [12,70].\
    \ This\nwas supported by minimum model loss compared to other function approximation-based\n\
    ML models. DL-LSTM not only integrates the thermal imagery features employed in\n\
    DL models but also combines the auxiliary soil and weather data inputs, of function\
    \ ap-\nproximation models. This eventually led to its superior performance over\
    \ the other ML\nmodels evaluated in this study as well as in prior studies of\
    \ crop stress and yield phenotyp-\ning [51] or irrigation forecasting [22]. However,\
    \ GoogleNet, Inception V3, and ResNet50\nprovided comparable or higher stress\
    \ prediction accuracy compared to the DL-LSTM model\n(Table 6). Stress/non-stress\
    \ misclassiﬁcation could be minimized through improved data\nsampling, increasing\
    \ training data size, and optimizing hyper-parameters, or by merging\ndifferent\
    \ ML and DL models for crop’s thermal emissivity and environment data inputs.\n\
    Among the feature extraction and function approximation-based approaches, the\
    \ feature\nextraction-based models outperformed all the function approximation-based\
    \ models for\nwater stress classiﬁcation.\nThe CNN models evaluated in this study\
    \ can be adopted for water stress identiﬁ-\ncation in other wheat cultivars while\
    \ for other crops and their cultivars, sufﬁcient data\nPlants 2022, 11, 3344\n\
    17 of 21\nacquisition, model training, and validations would be required. Along\
    \ similar lines, gath-\nering sufﬁcient data at different crop phenological stages\
    \ will enable growth stage-wise\naccuracy evaluation of ML and DL models in future\
    \ studies. The developed algorithms\nrequired below 5 sec to be successfully implemented\
    \ on independent images for classiﬁca-\ntion into stressed/non-stressed classes.\
    \ This is critical from a real-time stress diagnosis and\nmanagement perspective.\
    \ Trained algorithms are therefore transferrable to handheld or\nedge devices\
    \ for real-time stress detection by breeders, researchers, farmers, and students,\n\
    among others. For commercial adoption of the developed and tested approaches,\
    \ capital\ninvestment would be initially required following which high returns\
    \ may be expected\nthrough improvements in crop stress mitigation and management\
    \ at reduced costs [11].\n5. Conclusions\nThe canopy temperatures, relative water\
    \ content, soil moisture content, and grain\nyield for the wheat crop were signiﬁcantly\
    \ affected by the irrigation type and rates. Lower\nTc and higher RWC, SMC, and\
    \ yield were observed for irrigation at 100% of ETc compared\nto deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (75, 50, and 25% of ETc). Moreover, a comparable or higher yield was\nobserved\
    \ for sprinkler irrigation compared to conventional ﬂood irrigation and amounted\n\
    to 20% of the water savings.\nThermal images resulted in higher crop water stress\
    \ classification accuracy (94.7–98.4%)\ncompared to RGB imagery (92.5–96.9%).\
    \ Moreover, the DL models (including DL-LSTM)\nperformed better than the ML models\
    \ for stressed and non-stressed crop classiﬁcation.\nAmong the function approximation-based\
    \ approaches, DL-LSTM had the highest accuracy\n(96.7%). Among the feature extraction-based\
    \ methods, ResNet50 had the highest accuracy\nof 96.9% and 98.4% with RGB and\
    \ thermal imagery inputs, respectively.\nOverall, DL models with thermal imagery\
    \ inputs could be highly efﬁcient for crop\nwater stress phenotyping. As a future\
    \ scope, feature extraction-based DL models could\nbe implemented on edge-computing\
    \ devices for real-time water stress monitoring and\nactuation of irrigation systems\
    \ through the internet of things.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.A.R.\

    \ of this review was to synthesize existing evidence on GIS and RS applica-\n\
    tion in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policy and practice for improving\
    \ agriculture\nsustainability and identifying obstacles to their application,\
    \ particularly in low- and middle-income\ncountries. Systematic searches were\
    \ conducted in the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, Bielefeld\nAcademic Search\
    \ Engine, COnnecting REpositories (CORE), and Google Scholar. We identiﬁed\n2113\
    \ articles published between 2010–2021, out of which 40 articles met the inclusion\
    \ criteria. The\nresults show that GIS technology application in agriculture has\
    \ gained prominence in the last decade,\nwith 66% of selected papers being published\
    \ in the last six years. The main GIS application areas\nidentiﬁed included: crop\
    \ yield estimation, soil fertility assessment, cropping patterns monitoring,\n\
    drought assessment, pest and crop disease detection and management, precision\
    \ agriculture, and fer-\ntilizer and weed management. GIS technology has the potential\
    \ to enhance agriculture sustainability\nthrough integrating the spatial dimension\
    \ of agriculture into agriculture policies. In addition, GIS\npotential in promoting\
    \ evidenced informed decision making is growing. There is, however, a big gap\n\
    in GIS application in sub-Saharan Africa, with only one paper originating from\
    \ this region. With the\ngrowing threat of climate change to agriculture and food\
    \ security, there is an increased need for the\nintegration of GIS in policy and\
    \ decision making in improving agriculture sustainability.\nKeywords: GIS; RS;\
    \ spatial autocorrelation; policy integration; agri-spatial policy integration;\
    \ spatial;\nsustainable agri-food systems\n1. Introduction\nThe demand for food\
    \ globally has risen tremendously and is expected to increase\nto 59–98% by the\
    \ year 2050 [1]. However, the growing concerns are that the agricultural\nfood\
    \ production systems are unable to match the high demand, especially in poor na-\n\
    tions, causing an intensifying level of food insecurities [2]. The inefﬁciency\
    \ of the food\nproduction systems is also one of the reasons for food insecurity\
    \ [3]. How best to facilitate\nincreased food production without jeopardizing\
    \ land and water resources, energy, and the\nenvironment is a momentous task that\
    \ government and policymakers have to address [4].\nIn many low- and middle-income\
    \ countries (LMICs), most of the food production is\nrural-based, dominated by\
    \ smallholder and subsistence farmers. Enhancing smallholders’\nsustainability\
    \ requires that farmers are empowered with practicable information that en-\n\
    ables them not only to make evidence-informed decisions but also to implement\
    \ them in\nactivities that could increase their farm productivity and sustainability.\
    \ In efforts toward\ntransforming the weak and often inefﬁcient traditional subsistence\
    \ production practices,\nsustainable production approaches [5,6] that support\
    \ production-efﬁciency-enhancement\nand better agronomic practices are needed.\
    \ These include planting climate-resilient crops,\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169974\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n2 of 15\nhigh-yielding crop varieties, crop yield\
    \ forecasting, integrated pest management, as well as\nintegrating biodiversity\
    \ solutions in sustainable food production systems [7,8] Ultimately,\nthese novel\
    \ interventions would require comprehensive, up-to-date datasets (spatial and\n\
    non-spatial) and the adoption of advanced GIS technologies that can synthesize\
    \ and inte-\ngrate social, spatial, economic, demographic, and environmental data\
    \ in agriculture. The\noutput of this synthesis would be evidence-based spatial\
    \ knowledge that improves our\nunderstanding of agriculture sustainability and\
    \ in supporting better policies and decision-\nmaking processes.\nContemporary\
    \ advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing\n(RS), and\
    \ Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) technologies present an opportunity to\n\
    acquire and operationalize high-resolution satellite imagery and digital spatial\
    \ data [9].\nIn the agriculture sector, these spatial data have aided in the investigation\
    \ of the spatial\nlinkages of social, physical, agroecological, and environmental\
    \ complexities and how they\naffect agriculture sustainability. GIS technology\
    \ provides users with a mixture of geo-spatial\ninformation management tools and\
    \ methods that allow users to collect, store, integrate,\nquery, display, and\
    \ analyze geospatial data at various scales [10]. Remote sensing technol-\nogy\
    \ acquire images and other information about crops and soil from sensors mounted\
    \ on\ndifferent platforms including satellites, airborne remote sensing (manned\
    \ drones and un-\nmanned aerial vehicles), and ground-based equipment that is\
    \ then processed by computers\nto aid agricultural decision-making systems [11,12].\n\
    The spatial context of agriculture can be viewed from the perspective of farmers’\n\
    differentiated access to livelihood capitals, local resources, and access to essential\
    \ infras-\ntructure and services existing in a locality. In a GIS system, the\
    \ data containing each of\nthese aspects can be deconstructed as nested spatial\
    \ layers, each rooted in local geogra-\nphy by geographic coordinates captured\
    \ using GPS [13]. These spatial layers can then\nbe processed and analyzed in\
    \ a GIS system in multiple ways to reveal crop and soil con-\nditions and spatial\
    \ interactions, predict crop trends, monitor land-use change, monitor\npests,\
    \ and in biodiversity conservation [14–17]. They can also be used to map and reveal\n\
    spatial impediments to agricultural production, or even new information for improving\n\
    agricultural sustainability.\nIn recent times, the increasing complexity associated\
    \ with agriculture production sys-\ntems has aroused policymakers’ interest in\
    \ investigating how the spatial aspect “dimension”\nof agriculture can be exploited\
    \ using advanced GIS, RS, and GPS technologies to improve\nagricultural productivity\
    \ and better production practices [18,19]. The integration of GIS\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture has increased the opportunities for the development of even bet-\n\
    ter spatial explicit frameworks that support the creation of dynamic agriculture\
    \ databases\nand interactive systems [20]. Such database systems allow users to\
    \ interact with spatially\nreferenced agriculture data in real-time, while accurately\
    \ providing precise positional data,\nthus providing enhanced frameworks for decision\
    \ making. New ﬁelds that apply GIS in\nagriculture have emerged as a result. These\
    \ include precision agriculture, automated farm\nsystems, crop yield forecasting,\
    \ climate change detections, and the real-time monitoring of\ncrop production\
    \ [11,12,21]. These have the capability of improving agricultural production\n\
    and food security.\nIn this regard, several recent systematic literature reviews\
    \ have been conducted to\nilluminate and consolidate various ways GIS, RS, and\
    \ GPS technologies have been applied\nin the agriculture sector. García-Berná\
    \ et al. [11] used a systematic mapping study to focus\non the current trend and\
    \ what new opportunities in remote sensing techniques offer in\nagriculture. Their\
    \ study found increased uptake of RS technologies in the acquisition and\nextracting\
    \ of georeferenced data from satellite imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\
    Spatial data from these technologies have been applied in several areas including\
    \ crop\ngrowth and yield estimation, cropland parameter extraction, weed and disease\
    \ detection,\nand the monitoring of water and nutrients in plants. How this application\
    \ could be\nintegrated to improve spatial-based agriculture policymaking was not\
    \ elaborated by the\nauthors. The Al-Ismaili [22] review highlighted the integrated\
    \ application of RS and GIS\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n3 of 15\ntechniques\
    \ in precision agriculture and in the mapping, detection, and classiﬁcation of\n\
    the greenhouse through aerial images and satellites. How such a technique could\
    \ be\nassimilated into enhancing policymaking was not mentioned. In yet another\
    \ meta-review,\nWeiss et al. [12] research highlighted the emerging development\
    \ in RS that strengthens the\nspeciﬁc application of RS in crop breeding, agricultural\
    \ land use monitoring, crop yield\nforecasting, and biodiversity loss. Sharma,\
    \ Kamble, and Gunasekaran [23] focused on\nhow GIS data applications have assisted\
    \ in the development of precision agriculture. The\nauthors proposed a framework,\
    \ “Big GIS Analytic”, to guide how big GIS data should\nbe applied in the agriculture\
    \ supply chain. Their framework also lays a foundation for\na theoretical structure\
    \ for improving the quality of GIS data application in agriculture to\nelevate\
    \ productivity. These studies help us to understand how GIS and RS applications\
    \ in\nagricultural production systems have advanced. However, the available systematic\
    \ reviews\nseem not to explicitly provide how GIS and RS technologies could enhance\
    \ the integration\nof the spatial dimension of agriculture into policy frameworks\
    \ and interventions.\nThere is an increasing demand for evidence-supported decision\
    \ making to assist policymak-\ners in assessing the local needs of farmers, improving\
    \ production and supply value chains, and\ndeveloping spatial based-interventions.\
    \ In this regard, this review aimed at synthesizing existing\nevidence on GIS\
    \ and RS application in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policies for\n\
    improving agriculture sustainability and identifying obstacles for their application,\
    \ particularly\nin LMICs. The review draws on a decade of literature, from 2011\
    \ to 2021, to examine the current\nand future perspectives on integrating GIS\
    \ in policies that support agriculture sustainability.\nThe main contributions\
    \ of the study are to provide readers and policymakers with evidence on\nhow GIS\
    \ technology has been used in the agriculture sector to improve agricultural production\n\
    practices and inform how the technology can be adopted to improve evidence-based\
    \ decision\nmaking and policies. This paper is structured as follows: after the\
    \ introduction, we describe the\nmethodology applied to select and review the\
    \ articles; then, we detail the findings in Section 3.\nIn Section 4, we highlight\
    \ obstacles to applying GIS in agriculture policy and practice. Lastly,\nSections\
    \ 5 and 6 give the conclusion and the limitations of the study.\n2. Review Methodology\n\

    \ GIS was applied in the selected papers according to the research\ntopic in the\
    \ sections below.\n3.2.1. Crop Yield Estimation/Forecasting\nMonitoring crop growth\
    \ and early crop yield forecasting over agricultural ﬁelds is an\nimportant procedure\
    \ for food security planning and agricultural economic return prediction.\nThe\
    \ continued advancement in RS and GIS technologies has improved the process and\n\
    techniques of monitoring the development of crops and estimating their yields\
    \ [26,29,31].\nSeveral studies demonstrate the application of integrated GIS and\
    \ RS technologies in crop\nyield estimation. Memon et al.’s [24] study demonstrated\
    \ how integrating multispectral\nLandsat satellite imagery and comparing different\
    \ RS-based spectral indices were effective\nin measuring the percentage of wheat\
    \ straw cover and successively determining its effect\non yields of rice crops.\
    \ The knowledge can inform long-term planning of agriculture\nsustainability in\
    \ rice-wheat cropping systems. The result of the research by Hassan and\nGoheer\
    \ [27] showed that the accurate early estimation of wheat crop yield before harvesting\n\
    can be determined by using vegetation indices derived from moderate resolution\
    \ imaging\nspectroradiometer satellite imagery and crop yield data and the GIS\
    \ modelling approach. In\nyet another study, Hassan and Goheer [28] used a GIS-based\
    \ environment policy integrated\nclimate model that provided a practical tool\
    \ for simulating rice crop yield. The model\ncombined regional level crop level\
    \ data, soil data, farm management data, and climatic data\nto spatially estimate\
    \ variations in crop yield. Likewise, Al-Gaadi et al. [29] extracted the\nnormalized\
    \ difference vegetation index and soil-adjusted vegetation index from Landsat\n\
    satellite images acquired during the potato growth stages to predict potato tuber\
    \ crop\nyield. GIS- and RS-based crop yield forecasting models could have a wider\
    \ application in\ninforming spatially based agriculture policies. For example,\
    \ based on the output of these\nmodels, policy intervention can be designed to\
    \ manipulate the speciﬁc contributors to crop\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n\
    7 of 15\nyields (which include farm management techniques, weather conditions,\
    \ water availability,\naltitude, terrain, plant health, and policy intervention)\
    \ [25,30]. Forecasting crop yields\nwell before harvest is crucial, especially\
    \ in a region characterized by climatic uncertainties.\nMonitoring agricultural\
    \ crop growth conditions and the prediction of potential crop yield is\nimportant\
    \ in planning and policymaking for food security and agricultural economic return\n\
    prediction [26,28,31]. This could include developing policies for improving agriculture\n\
    productivity and sustainability [28]. In feeding a growing population in LMICs,\
    \ agricultural\nproduction systems must strive to reduce the food production yield\
    \ gap between current\nyields achieved by farmers and those potentially attainable\
    \ in rainfed subsistence farming\nsystems. In addressing this mismatch, the study\
    \ by Hochman et al. [30] developed a model\nthat integrated statistical yield\
    \ and cropping area data, remotely sensed data, cropping\nsystem simulation, and\
    \ GIS mapping to assess and map wheat yield gaps.\n3.2.2. Soil Quality/Fertility\
    \ Assessment\nSoil quality assessment is critical for designing sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices\n(optimal agricultural use) that can help bridge the current food\
    \ production and demand\ngap in overcoming the food security problem. The availability\
    \ of RS datasets and GIS spatial\nmodelling techniques provides new opportunities\
    \ for measuring/evaluating soil quality at\ndifferent spatial scales [33,36].\
    \ Shokr et al. [35] developed a spatially-explicit soil quality\nmodel by combining\
    \ soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties and integrating\nthese\
    \ with a digital elevation model and Sentinel-2 satellite image to produce digital\
    \ soil\nmaps. Abdelfattah and Kumar [32] describe the application GIS-enabled\
    \ web-based soil\ninformation system that provides a descriptive, quantitative,\
    \ and geospatial soil database\nin a simple interface. The system was applied\
    \ to determine the sufﬁciency potential of soils\nfor plant growing and management.\
    \ Using GIS and RS technologies, Abdellatif et al. [38]\ndeveloped a spatial model\
    \ for the assessment of soil quality. His model combined four\nmain soil quality\
    \ indices (soil fertility index, soil physical index, soil chemical index, and\n\
    geomorphological properties Index) and GIS ordinary kriging spatial interpolation\
    \ to map\nthe soil quality index. The application of these GIS-based models provides\
    \ evidence-based\nways to improve soil quality management. This would enable decision\
    \ makers, policy\nformulators, land-use planners, and agriculturalists to efﬁciently\
    \ manage soil resources to\nensure the sustainable use of agricultural lands according\
    \ to their potential [34,36,37]. Thus,\nassessing soil quality indicators would\
    \ be important for sustainable agricultural policies\nand practices and in achieving\
    \ food security.\n3.2.3. Crop Mapping and Monitoring Decision Support Systems\n\
    In an era of unpredictable climate changes, agricultural crop monitoring analysis\n\
    could help government policymakers and farmers plan and design cropping patterns\
    \ that\nadapt to water availability. Agricultural monitoring systems integrate\
    \ multiple geospatial\ndata sets and cropping system models into computer algorithms\
    \ to spatially compute\nand simulate optimum scenarios for site-speciﬁc conditions\
    \ for crop production [42]. A\ncrop monitoring system is developed by integrating\
    \ geospatial data obtained by high-\nresolution remote sensing with a web GIS\
    \ geoportal interface [41]. Santosh and Suresh [39]\ndemonstrated the uniqueness\
    \ of combining GIS and RS in a tool for crop selection and\nrotation analysis\
    \ at the farm level to improve crop management decisions. Cropping\npatterns simulation\
    \ is determined by irrigation water availability, which in turn is affected\n\
    by changes in climate and irrigation water extraction policies. Wang et al. [16]\
    \ combined\nGIS and irrigation water availability simulation models to analyze\
    \ the cropping patterns\nbased on the forecast of irrigation water availability.\
    \ A GIS web-based crop mapping\nand monitoring decision support system at the\
    \ farm level could help farmers to access\ninformation and take appropriate measures\
    \ to improve crop production [39]. Such a\nsystem can have a wider application\
    \ in supporting agronomic decision making including\noptimizing land and labor\
    \ productivities, enhancing higher cropping intensities, and\nSustainability 2022,\
    \ 14, 9974\n8 of 15\nproducing better crop yield [40]. This can increase crop\
    \ production and ensure better crop\nmanagement, in the long run, and precision\
    \ irrigation management.\n3.2.4. Agricultural Drought Assessment\nUsing spatial\
    \ datasets generated by satellite RS and GIS technologies offers very useful\n\
    information for assessing and modelling agricultural drought-risk patterns, monitoring\n\
    drought conditions, and producing drought vulnerability (risk) maps [48]. Hoque\
    \ et al. [43]\nintegrated geospatial techniques with fuzzy logic to develop a\
    \ comprehensive spatial\ndrought risk inventory model for operational drought\
    \ management. This model success-\nfully identiﬁed the spatial extents and distribution\
    \ of agricultural drought risk. Sehgal and\nDhakar [44] used GIS and high spatial\
    \ resolution RS-derived indicators of crop sensitivity to\ndevelop a methodology\
    \ that assessed and mapped, at a local scale, key biophysical factors\ncontributing\
    \ to agricultural drought vulnerability. The drought vulnerability maps could\n\
    inform policymakers in formulating spatially explicit policies for drought mitigation\
    \ and\nintervention strategies [45,46]. In addition, vulnerability maps could\
    \ be used to indicate\nwhere socioeconomic development policy programs should\
    \ be given priority [47].\n3.2.5. Pest and Crop Disease Detection and Management\n\
    Several geospatial tools and techniques continue to be developed to aid farmers\
    \ in\ncrop disease control and management strategies. Several studies [49–52]\
    \ provide practical\napplication of satellite RS data and Geospatial techniques\
    \ for sustainable crop disease\ndetection and management. RS technology including\
    \ Airborne and satellite imagery\nacquired during growing seasons has been used\
    \ for early- and within-season detection,\nmapping of some crop diseases, the\
    \ control of recurring diseases in future seasons, and\nassessing economic loss\
    \ caused by frost damage [49]. Santoso et al. [50] used high-resolution\nQuickBird\
    \ satellite imagery to effectively detect spatial patterns of oil palm plants\
    \ infected\nby basal stem rot disease. They used six vegetation indices derived\
    \ from visible and\nnear-infrared bands satellite imagery to successfully discriminate\
    \ between healthy and\ninfected oil palms. Using precision agriculture technologies\
    \ and remote sensed imagery,\nYang [52] showed how site-speciﬁc fungicide application\
    \ to disease-infested areas has been\nimplemented for effective control of the\
    \ disease. In the future, new approaches that apply\ngeoinformation technologies\
    \ in monitoring and management of pest and crop disease\ndetection could reduce\
    \ the effect of pesticides and herbicide chemicals on the environment.\n3.2.6.\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nIn precision agriculture, automated geospatial analysis\
    \ and decision support algo-\nrithms can provide valuable scientiﬁc information\
    \ to policymakers for better agriculture\npolicy development. Precision agriculture\
    \ practices, which employ integrated GIS, RS,\nand GPS technologies, have gained\
    \ prominence in their ability to optimize crop produc-\ntion, facilitate site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop management, and reduce the application of agrochem-\nicals. Toscano et\
    \ al. [58] demonstrated the usefulness of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 im-\nages to\
    \ depict the within-ﬁeld spatial variability of wheat yield, which is key for\
    \ adopt-\ning precision farming techniques. This provided a potential alternative\
    \ to traditional\nfarming practices by improving site-speciﬁc management and agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nGarcía et al. [59] tested the performance of remote sensing drones\
    \ as mobile gateways to\nprovide a guide to the optimal drone parameters for successful\
    \ Wi-Fi data transmission\nbetween sensor nodes and the gateway in precision agriculture\
    \ systems. The study suc-\ncessfully demonstrated that drones (ﬂying at the lowest\
    \ velocity, at a height of 24 m, and\nwith an antenna with 25 m of coverage) can\
    \ be used as a remote sensing tool to gather the\ndata from the nodes deployed\
    \ on the ﬁelds for crop monitoring and management. This had\nthe potential to\
    \ increase the adoption of precision agriculture by even smallholder farmers.\n\
    Segarra et al.’s [60] study speciﬁcally focused to understand the European Space\
    \ Agency’s\ntwin Sentinel-2 satellites’ features and their application in precision\
    \ agriculture. Their study\nhighlights that Sentinel-2 has dramatically increased\
    \ the capabilities for agricultural moni-\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n9 of\
    \ 15\ntoring and crop management, abiotic and biotic stresses detection, improved\
    \ the estimation\nof crop yields, enhanced crop type classiﬁcations, and provided\
    \ a variety of other useful\napplications in agriculture. All of these contribute\
    \ to increasing the adoption of precision\nagriculture, which leads to more productive\
    \ and sustainable agriculture management and\nenvironmental sustainability [61,62].\
    \ In precision agriculture, plantation-rows extraction\nusing satellite image-based\
    \ solutions is essential in crop harvesting, pest management, and\nplant grow-rate\
    \ predictions. The study of Fareed and Rehman [55] used GIS and RS to\ndesign\
    \ an automated method to extract plantation rows from a drone-based image point\n\
    clouds-based digital surface model. The automatic plantation rows extraction can\
    \ be used\nto quantify plantation-row damage assessment in precision agriculture.\n\
    3.2.7. Weed Management and Fertilizer Decision Support System\nAccurate weed distribution\
    \ mapping could greatly enhance efﬁciency in weed man-\nagement and reduce weed\
    \ damage, overhead costs of herbicide application, and the ratio-\nnalization\
    \ of fertilizers [57]. Dunaieva et al. [21] used GIS technologies to produce accurate\n\
    weed distribution maps in rice farms. This information improved the efﬁciency\
    \ of input\napplication, thus reducing the consumption of inputs including herbicides,\
    \ fungicides,\nand weeding labor costs. This in turn reduced the weed damage and\
    \ crop production\noverhead costs. Xie et al. [56] demonstrated the application\
    \ of GIS in the development of a\nGIS-based Fertilizer Decision Support System\
    \ (FDSS) by integrating RS data, ﬁeld surveys,\nand expert knowledge to develop\
    \ a soil spatial database on the SuperMap platform for crop\nmanagement systems.\
    \ The application of FDSS in agricultural production had beneﬁts,\nsuch as increasing\
    \ fertilizer utilization efﬁciency, thus lowering production costs.\n4. Obstacles\
    \ to Applying GIS in Agriculture Policy and Practice\nGenerally, the use of GIS\
    \ and RS technologies is not a panacea to successful evidence-\nbased policy and\
    \ practice and has its downside. The success of the geospatial technology\napplication\
    \ depends on its proper use, quality data, and considerable resources in its man-\n\
    agement. In countries that suffer low resources, such as LMICs, the cost of the\
    \ technology\nand lack of appropriate skills jeopardize its wider use and adoption\
    \ [63]. Simulating crop\nyield production is always challenging due to the variety\
    \ of cropping systems and levels\nof technology used. Accurate crop yield gap\
    \ assessment would require improvements\nin input data quality, including accurate\
    \ weather parameters, better soil characterization,\nand spatially distributed\
    \ land use data [28]. It would also demand the setting up of in-\nstrumented geo-referenced\
    \ validation sites that provide comprehensive survey data to\ninform a continuous\
    \ improvement cycle for yield gap assessment [30]. As such, future im-\nprovements\
    \ in current remote sensing technology and the development of better-integrated\n\
    cropping systems models would provide more accurate inputs for yield gap assessment.\n\
    In drought vulnerability assessment and mapping, most studies reported in the\
    \ literature\ntended to use aggregated spatial data at higher spatial scales (national\
    \ or regional level), but\nnot at a finer scale (i.e., local level). Since the\
    \ intensity of drought hazards is more felt and\nmanifested at the local level,\
    \ a detailed drought-risk mapping at a finer scale would require\nhigh resolution\
    \ remote sensing and the use of locally contextual indicators to yield a full\n\
    picture of vulnerability. This would have more relevance to policymakers whose\
    \ intent is to\nformulate and implement mitigation interventions at the local\
    \ level. With the prediction of\nmore severe and frequent drought uncertainties\
    \ and increasingly threats from climate change,\ndrought-risk mapping that incorporates\
    \ all the spatially explicit risk components would be a\nhighly efficient contribution\
    \ to drought-mitigating strategies. More skills and knowledge on\nthe use of geospatial\
    \ techniques for agricultural drought risk are needed.\nIn crop disease detection,\
    \ challenges still exist in mapping them using airborne or\nsatellite imagery.\
    \ Although many crop diseases can be successfully detected and mapped\nusing satellite\
    \ imagery, each disease has its characteristics that would require different\n\
    procedures for detection and management. According to Yang, [52] “some diseases\
    \ are\ndifﬁcult to detect, especially when multiple biotic and abiotic conditions\
    \ with similar\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n10 of 15\nspectral characteristics\
    \ exist within the same ﬁeld” (pg. 531). Recurring diseases would\nrequire consistent\
    \ historical imagery and spatial-temporal data, while emerging diseases\nare more\
    \ difﬁcult to detect. Yang argues that more advanced RS imaging sensors and\n\
    image-processing techniques for differentiating diseases from other confounding\
    \ factors\nare needed. In less-developed countries, very few farmers have the\
    \ necessary skills required\nto use RS technologies in creating their prescription\
    \ maps, in the implementation of disease\nmanagement and in the site-speciﬁc fungicide\
    \ application. More research is needed in\nthe development of integrated geospatial\
    \ analytical methodologies and tools for aiding\nfarmers in the detection of different\
    \ crop diseases.\nAlthough precision agriculture technologies can aid in optimizing\
    \ crops and facili-\ntating agricultural management decisions in solving food\
    \ insecurity challenges in LMICs,\nprecision farming requires the adoption of\
    \ geospatial technology and a large amount of\nhigh-resolution spatiotemporal\
    \ data. A lack of skills to use GIS and RS in LMICs can be\naugmented by the dissemination\
    \ and the transfer of practical geospatial technologies from\ndeveloped countries\
    \ [51]. However, considerable investments in ICT infrastructure are\nneeded for\
    \ the effective adaptation of precision agricultural approaches in LMICs.\nSoil\
    \ fertility assessment is considered one of the most important indicators of precision\n\
    farming and for the sustainable use of agricultural lands according to their potential.\
    \ This\nrequires a comprehensive soil information system. However, according to\
    \ Abdelfattah and\nKumar [32], much of the world has very poor coverage of soil\
    \ quality data. In LMICs, the\nfragmentation of agricultural land into small uneconomical\
    \ plots and unsustainable farming\npractices is happening at a much higher rate.\
    \ In such a rapidly changing environment, the\npotential of active remote sensors\
    \ to determine soil quality requires further research.\nOther obstacles to the\
    \ use and adoption of GIS and RS in agriculture include a lack of\ncommonly agreed\
    \ data interoperability standards. Though there is increasing availability\nof\
    \ spatial data usage in LMICs, many of these data are prone to error and are often\
    \ collected\nand stored with different spatial units, formats, metadata, time,\
    \ and space intervals. This\nmakes some data unusable, prevents spatial data integration,\
    \ and hinders a uniﬁed analysis\nof data, especially those collected from multiple\
    \ sensors and platforms. A need exists on\ndeveloping standardized guidelines\
    \ for agriculture spatial data. Training for researchers,\npractitioners, and\
    \ farmers on how to collect quality and accurate spatial data that can\nbe usable\
    \ in multi-platform systems is paramount. Developing spatial data repositories\n\
    with better interoperability can enable data integration and improve the efﬁciency\
    \ of data\nanalyses. In this regard, crowdsourced data collection would be a promising\
    \ contribution\nto developing cost-effective agri-spatial data repositories.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper has explored various ways GIS technology has been integrated\
    \ into agricul-\nture to improve agriculture decisions and policymaking. GIS and\
    \ RS technologies present\nbetter methods for the analysis of spatial factors\
    \ that affect agricultural production as\ncompared to approaches where geographically\
    \ explicit data are absent. If well exploited,\nthe spatially integrated knowledge\
    \ provided by GIS and RS can be applied to enhance\nagriculture policy and evidence-based\
    \ interventions geared towards improving agricul-\nture sustainability. Though\
    \ GIS technologies provide a promising pathway for improving\nagronomic practices,\
    \ they remain underexploited in many LMICs where a dire need for\nenhancing agriculture\
    \ and food production practices is most needed. For LMIC govern-\nments and farmers\
    \ to better exploit the beneﬁt of GIS and RS technologies, there is a need\nfor\
    \ an increased level of awareness and potential use of spatial data related to\
    \ agriculture.\nFurther advances in geoinformatics techniques and computing infrastructure\
    \ will allow\na more collaborative framework amongst scientists, policymakers,\
    \ researchers, extension\npersonnel, crop consultants, and farm equipment and\
    \ chemical dealers with practical guide-\nlines for effective management of crop\
    \ yield estimations, soil fertility, cropping pattern and\nmonitoring, drought\
    \ risks, and fertilizer and weed management.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n\
    11 of 15\nIn enhancing evidence-based agriculture policy, government and policymakers\
    \ would\nrequire hard evidence that brings a clear understanding of the complexity\
    \ and interconnect-\nedness of factors affecting agriculture productivity. This\
    \ would in turn enable designing\nconcrete intervention strategies. Additionally,\
    \ a broad spectrum of stakeholders and\npractitioners in the agriculture sector\
    \ would need location-speciﬁc agricultural data in\nimplementing a wide array\
    \ of decisions that improve agricultural production potential.\nEqually, smallholder\
    \ farmers would require synthesized information to empower them not\nonly to make\
    \ evidence-informed decisions but also to implement practicable activities that\n\
    increase agricultural productivity. This raises the demand for GIS integration\
    \ in agriculture\npolicy formulation and implementation.\nGIS and RS technologies\
    \ provide a big potential in the assessment, storage, processing, and\nproduction\
    \ of agriculture data. The data could be useful in precision agriculture, site-specific\n\
    farming, and disease detection, among others, all geared toward improving agriculture\
    \ food\nproduction and food security issues. Unfortunately, the lack of quality\
    \ spatial data in many\nlocal governments has continued to undermine decision-making,\
    \ policy formulation and the\neffectiveness in their implementation. Where such\
    \ data exists, there is a generally lack of\nskills on the use of GIS and RS spatial\
    \ analytical techniques. Achieving spatially integrated\nagriculture policies\
    \ demands comprehensive, up-to-date spatial datasets and better methods\nthat\
    \ combine and analyze complex data from various sources to produce useful information.\n\
    This would necessitate national as well as local governments to adopt methods,\
    \ strategies,\nand techniques that facilitate the collection and analysis of diverse\
    \ agricultural datasets in\nproviding comprehensive insights to policymakers,\
    \ planners, farmers, and a broad spectrum of\nstakeholders in the agriculture\
    \ sector. GIS thus provides a promising pathway for the acquisition\nof comprehensive,\
    \ up-to-date spatial databases and better spatial analysis methods that are\n\
    capable of analyzing complex data to produce useful information. If properly adopted\
    \ and\nimplemented, GIS can enhance the spatial decision support system in improving\
    \ the efficiency\nand effectiveness of agriculture policy formulation and planning.\
    \ Nonetheless, policy change\ncan guide and catalyze actions but requires public\
    \ and political will to actualize it. Thus, the\nadoption of GIS technology in\
    \ policymaking would require local government to commit public\nfunds to set up\
    \ the required software, hardware, supportive infrastructure, and training of\n\
    staff to use them. Future studies can focus on how GIS and RS technology could\
    \ promote a\ncollaborative framework amongst scientists, policymakers, researchers,\
    \ extension agriculture\nofficers in promoting sustainable, and climate-smart\
    \ farming practices, especially in LMICs.\n6. Limitations of the Study\nThe results\
    \ of this study are purely based on the 40 articles spanning 10 years\n(2010–2021)\
    \ and the learning obtained from them. As a result, we might not have in-\ncluded\
    \ some signiﬁcant research papers published in earlier years. However, the purpose\n\
    of this review was to analyze the most recent trends and relevant publications\
    \ in the appli-\ncation of GIS in agriculture. For this reason, we argue that\
    \ the 40 papers are comprehensive,\nand it is unlikely that the content of previously\
    \ published papers would have substantially\naltered our ﬁndings. Furthermore,\
    \ the selection criteria only included peer-reviewed pa-\npers. However, reﬂections\
    \ on GIS methodologies are sometimes published in books or grey\nliterature since\
    \ they have more space for in-depth reﬂections. To reduce this limitation, we\n\
    formulated our search string to include a broad range of the most relevant terms\
    \ of interest\nin this study. In addition, we performed the search in the largest\
    \ indexed databases of\nSCOPUS, BASE, CORE, and Clarivate. To account for signiﬁcant\
    \ papers that might have not\nbeen indexed in these databases, we also included\
    \ the search results from Google Scholar.\nNotwithstanding these few limitations,\
    \ the insights provided in this review provide valu-\nable information and knowledge\
    \ on GIS and RS application in enhancing evidence-based\npolicy interventions\
    \ for enhancing agriculture sustainability, as well as identifying barriers\n\
    to their application in the LMIC context.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n12 of\

    Green Chemistry  Conversion of lignin pyrolysis oil to cyclohexyl methyl ethers
    as a promising biomass-derived solvent† Sohaib Haseeb,a   Jesse R. Vanderveen,

    A mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers was prepared from Kraft lignin pyrolysis
    oil for use as a biomass-derived aliphatic solvent. Using Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic
    parameters, it was determined that the solvent mixture is somewhat more basic
    and polar than cyclopentyl methyl ether. Neither the biomass-derived solvent nor
    pure cyclohexyl methyl ether formed any detectable peroxides in 12 weeks of exposure
    to air, even though THF formed peroxides rapidly under such conditions. This mixture
    can be used as a biomass-derived aliphatic ether solvent and as a potential replacement
    for THF, dioxane, ethyl acetate, acetone and 2-butanone. Introduction Lignocellulose
    is the most abundant biomass available for use as a renewable feedstock for the
    synthesis of chemical products.1 All three components of lignocellulose: lignin,
    cellulose, and hemicellulose are being explored as alternatives to fossil fuels
    as feedstocks for preparation of a wide variety of materials such as fuels, polymers
    and value-added chemicals.1 These three components can be separated from each
    other by various methods.2,3–6 Lignin, the second-most abundant component in lignocellulose
    after cellulose,7,8 is the main byproduct of the conventional pulp and paper industry.7
    However, currently, the main use of lignin is as a low-grade energy source.8 Holladay
    et al. (2007) pointed out that overall revenue could be increased from $12 billion
    to $35 billion if lignin were used to produce value-added chemicals and transportation
    fuel, rather than power.8 However, lignin is a complex, cross-linked, and non-repeating
    polymer that can require extensive processing before it can be used for a particular
    application or treatment. Pyrolysis of lignin produces a complex liquid mixture,
    primarily of phenols, called lignin pyrolysis oil (LPO).9–11 There are two general
    strategies for making chemical products from this oil. First, one can separate
    LPO into individual compounds, at significant expense, and then sell those compounds
    as specialty chemicals. A historical example is the production of vanillin from
    lignin, which is no longer practiced. The second option is to use the LPO or fractions
    thereof as mixtures, without separating the individual compounds. This second
    strategy is less expensive, but the products can only be used in lower-value applications
    where mixtures, rather than pure compounds, are acceptable. The only product that
    is currently commercially produced from LPO, smoke flavouring, is an example of
    this second strategy. Different approaches have been proposed to extract phenols
    from LPO. Solvent extraction is a technique extensively used to separate phenolic
    compounds from pyrolysis oil, as a mixture.12 Steam distillation separates phenols
    at a lower temperature than their normal boiling points.13 However, the temperature
    of 105 °C was still found to be too high for thermally sensitive pyrolysis oil,
    and further separation was required because the concentration of phenols in the
    distillate was relatively low.13 Molecular distillation can be used to extract
    thermally unstable materials. However, the method requires expensive equipment
    and high vacuum, which makes it cost-prohibitive.14–16 Our group has reported
    a supercritical fluid rectification (SFR) method for separating single ring phenols
    from the heavier components of lignin pyrolysis oil (LPO).10,11 In the same study,
    isothermal supercritical CO2 extraction was also shown to be effective, although
    not quite as selective. The resulting mixtures of single ring phenols can be methylated
    to make polar aprotic solvents (aromatic ethers) as substitutes for petroleum-derived
    aromatic solvents like toluene, xylene, and anisole.11 There is also a need for
    bio-derived aliphatic ether solvents to replace petroleum-derived aliphatic ethers
    such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Such solvents are not only unsustainable
    but are prone to forming dangerous peroxides over time.17,18 Here we report the
    conversion of LPO into a mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers that can serve as
    a biomass-derived aliphatic ether solvent. The composition, Kamlet–Taft properties,
    and risk of peroxide formation of the mixture are reported. This mixture may be
    used as a renewably-sourced alternative to fossil-derived low to medium polarity
    solvents, in applications or formulations where a pure single-compound solvent
    is not required. Such applications may include inks, adhesives, cleaning solvents,
    and paint stripper. Moreover, both the aromatic and aliphatic ether mixtures can
    be used as oxygenates for gasoline or diesel. Several ethers such as ethyl tert-butyl
    ether, tert-amyl ethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, and tert-amyl methyl ether
    have been shown to impart excellent fuel properties.19 Ethers are preferred due
    to their high octane numbers and cause less pollution, because they do not contain
    sulfur and produce lower levels of carbon monoxide when they burn.19 Results and
    discussion The conversion of LPO to aliphatic ethers was envisioned as a process
    involving three steps which could, theoretically, be performed in any sequence:
    (1) methylation of the phenolic components of LPO, (2) isolation of the single-ring
    compounds from the heavier components, and (3) hydrogenation of the aromatic rings
    (Scheme 1). This particular sequence was chosen for two reasons. First, the rectification
    method developed by the Jessop group11 and used in this study is selective for
    single ring aromatic ethers and guaiacols, but rejects catechols and multi-ring
    compounds. Because catechols are anticipated to be a constituent of the LPO that
    could be converted to cyclohexyl methyl ethers, it is desirable to methylate the
    catechols to veratroles prior to rectification in order to obtain greater yields
    of anisoles/veratroles from the rectification step. Second, it is beneficial to
    remove unwanted material earlier in the process to avoid consuming reagents unnecessarily
    and to decrease the likelihood of unwanted side reactions. For that reason, the
    rectification step was performed prior to the hydrogenation step. Scheme 1 The
    synthetic route for converting LPO into cyclohexyl methyl ethers. Methylation
    and supercritical fluid rectification of LPO The phenolic groups present in LPO
    were methylated using stoichiometric amounts of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene
    (DBU) and an excess of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as both solvent and methylating
    agent. This methylation procedure was first tested on several individual compounds
    that are known10 to exist in LPO, including phenol, guaiacol, catechol, and eugenol;
    these model compounds were all successfully methylated with yields in excess of
    95% (Table S1†). The crude isolated product after methylation of the LPO retained
    97% of the mass of the LPO. The crude product was then purified by SFR. The SFR
    procedure involves extracting the lighter components from the LPO using supercritical
    CO2 (scCO2) and passing the scCO2 solution up a progressively hotter steel column
    packed with small steel rings.11 The rectification process produces a mixture
    of aromatic single ring ethers which we refer to as lignin oil methyl ethers (LOME).
    The composition of LOME was determined by GC-MS (Table S2†). The compounds were
    identified using standards and by comparing mass spectra with spectra in the NIST
    MS Library.20 4-Methyl veratrole, veratrole, 4-ethyl veratrole, 2,3-dimethylanisole
    and 4-ethylveratrole were the major components in the LOME mixture (Table S2†),
    which matches the observations of Mudraboyina et al.11 Hydrogenation of rectified
    ethers A procedure for the hydrogenation of LOME was developed using veratrole
    as a model reactant. Catalysts and conditions were screened to identify a procedure
    that would provide a high conversion of veratrole to 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane
    (Table 1). Table 1 Hydrogenation catalyst and conditions screened for the heterogeneously

    90 10 a 24 h reaction. b Veratrole (0.1 g) was dissolved in hexanes (3 ml). Solvent-free
    conditions were used for all the other trials. Initially, different catalysts
    were screened for the hydrogenation at 80 °C (entries 1–5). Using Rh(5%)/C (entry
    2) resulted in a nearly complete reaction of veratrole with 84% yield of the desired
    product 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane. Hydrogenations using other catalysts all had
    large quantities (25–75%) of unreacted veratrole remaining after the reaction
    time. Each catalyst, including Rh(5%)/C, also produced cyclohexyl methyl ether
    as a byproduct. Although this demethoxylation was an unanticipated side reaction,
    cyclohexyl methyl ether would be a welcome component in the aliphatic ether mixture
    we are trying to produce and is likely to also be produced from the methylation
    and hydrogenation of the phenol present in LPO. Further demethoxylation to cyclohexane
    was negligible. Based on the results, Rh(5%)/C was identified as the best catalyst
    of those tested. Hydrogenations of pure veratrole were carried out next using
    Rh(5%)/C under different conditions in an attempt to limit the formation of side
    products (entries 6–11). Reactions at lower temperatures or H2 pressures all had
    unreacted veratrole present, even after extended reaction times. Solvent-free
    conditions were used for the initial reactions. When hexanes was used as the solvent,27,28
    conversion of veratrole to 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane improved, even if the temperature
    was lowered to 50 °C, and apart from cyclohexyl methyl ether, negligible amounts
    of side products or unreacted veratrole were present (entry 11). The combined
    yield of the 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and cyclohexyl methyl ether was >99%. Therefore,
    the conditions described in entry 11 were selected as the conditions to be used
    for LOME hydrogenation. Prior to LOME hydrogenation, a desulfurization step is
    required to prevent catalyst poisoning. Sulfur is present as an impurity in Kraft
    lignin. Even after rectification, approx. 1 wt% sulfur was present in the LOME
    according to elemental analysis. Attempts at hydrogenation without prior desulfurization
    were not successful. The sulfur was removed using a RANEY® nickel slurry in alkaline
    water following the procedure described by Field et al.21 No sulfur was detected
    by elemental analysis after the RANEY® nickel wash. LOME prepared from raw lignocellulose
    or from lignin separated without use of sulfur-containing reagents would presumably
    not require this desulfurization step. Hydrogenation of LOME was performed using
    the best conditions identified for veratrole (entry 11) in Table 1 and the major
    compounds were identified by comparing mass spectra with spectra in the NIST MS
    Library.20 Methoxycyclohexane, 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane
    were identified. The hydrogenated lignin oil methyl ethers (HLOME) were analyzed
    by 1H (Fig. S1†), 13C (Fig. S2†), DEPT 135 (Fig. S3†) NMR and IR (Fig. S4†) spectroscopy.
    It is difficult to determine whether the methylation was complete using NMR spectroscopy.
    However, the IR spectrum of HLOME has a broad peak around 3500 cm−1, which has
    a weaker absorbance intensity than cyclohexanol. This suggests the presence of
    some unreacted hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum shows that all peaks corresponding
    to aromatic protons have disappeared (the 13C {1H} NMR spectrum confirms this).
    In the 1H NMR spectrum the peaks at 3.1–4.3 ppm correspond to methoxy and methoxymethine
    protons and the peaks at 0.8–2.1 ppm corresponds to aliphatic protons. Kamlet–Taft
    properties of lignin-derived ethers Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic parameters are
    the most comprehensive measure of solvent properties.22,23 Mathematical combinations
    of these parameters can be used to predict the solvent effect on a variety of
    parameters such as solubility, rate constants, equilibrium constants and spectral
    frequencies.23 Compounds with similar Kamlet–Taft parameters are likely to perform
    similarly as solvents. Therefore, these parameters can be used to determine which
    non-renewably sourced solvents could potentially be replaced by HLOME. Polarity/polarizability
    (π*) and hydrogen bond accepting ability (β) were calculated from the UV/visible
    absorption maxima of 4-nitroanisole and 4-nitroaniline dissolved in the solvent.22
    Taft and coworkers assigned an α (hydrogen bond donating ability) value of 0.00
    for ethers,23 therefore, we assumed that the hydrogen bond donating ability of
    HLOME is negligible. However, the presence of a small amount of unreacted hydroxyl
    groups could give the HLOME some hydrogen bond donating ability. π* is the ability
    of the solvent to stabilize a charge or dipole moment and is therefore high for
    polar or polarizable solvents. HLOME has a π* value of 0.57, lower than anisole
    (0.73), because the aromaticity of anisole increases its polarizability. The π*
    of HLOME is slightly higher than that of cyclopentyl methyl ether (0.42). The
    hydrogen bond accepting ability (β) of HLOME is 0.75. It is unsurprisingly larger
    than anisole (0.22) and somewhat larger than cyclopentyl methyl ether (0.53).
    Aromatic ethers like anisole are known to be much weaker bases than their aliphatic
    counterparts. However, the difference between the β value of the ether mixture
    and cyclopentyl methyl ether was unexpected and may be due to the presence of
    1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and other more complex structures. Such components in
    the mixture may also explain the higher π*. Peroxide formation in lignin-derived
    ethers A serious safety concern regarding the use of aliphatic ethereal solvents
    is their potential to form explosive organic peroxides over time. For this reason,
    ethers are often discarded after 3 or 12 months even if they have been spiked
    with inhibitors to slow down peroxide formation.6 Nevertheless, explosions due
    to peroxide formation in ethers still occur. Ethers that have low tendencies to
    form peroxides, such as tert-butyl methyl ether24 and cyclopentyl methyl ether,18
    have safety advantages over other ethers and their use is preferred even though
    they are fossil-fuel derived. The rate of peroxidation of methoxycyclohexane,
    a major component of the HLOME, was compared to that of tetrahydrofuran and cyclopentyl
    methyl ether under air to determine whether methoxycyclohexane and, by extension,
    HLOME, are dangerously prone to peroxidation. The ethers were purified, placed
    in 3 amber vials per solvent under air, and stored in a solvent cabinet for a
    period of 12 weeks to allow peroxides to form. A sample of HLOME mixture was also
    placed in an amber vial and stored under the same conditions. All samples were
    opened and exposed to fresh air once per week. After the 12-week period, the solvents
    were quantitatively tested for peroxide content by iodometry. The results (Table
    2) show that tetrahydrofuran forms peroxides much more quickly than cyclopentyl
    methyl ether. This result is in agreement with the report by Watanabe et al.18
    Additionally, no peroxides were detected in either HLOME or cyclohexyl methyl
    ether by iodometry. Therefore, cyclohexyl methyl ether and HLOME have a very low
    tendency to form peroxides, evidently lower than cyclopentyl methyl ether. Table

    solvents are used in large quantities in industrial processes and products such
    as coatings, paint stripper, cleaning solutions, adhesives, and inks. In many
    such applications there is no requirement that the solvent be a single pure compound.
    The volume of solvent usage in such applications greatly exceeds the volume of
    solvents used as media for chemical synthesis. Replacing petroleum-derived organic
    solvents with bio-derived solvents could make solvent usage more environmentally
    sustainable, but only if the bio-derived solvents do not introduce new health
    and environmental concerns. To this end, we compared the health and environmental
    effects of HLOME to THF, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), cyclopentyl methyl
    ether and methoxycyclohexane in Table 3. Health and environmental effects can
    be compared using experimental or computationally-predicted values such as LD50
    or using GHS (globally harmonized system) classifications. The latter approach
    will be used here. Table 3 Health and environmental impacts of THF, cyclopentyl

    be greater than or equal to that of its most volatile component, methoxycyclohexane.
    Similarly, the melting point is estimated as that of methyoxycyclohexane. e Solubility
    range of HLOME in water was assumed according to the solubility of major components
    in HLOME (methoxycyclohexane, 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane.
    The actual solubility range is likely to be broader. f It is assumed to be as
    flammable as its most volatile component (i.e. cyclohexyl methyl ether). g H301/302.
    Category 4 means 300 < LD50 ≤ 2000 mg kg−1. Category 5 means 2000 < LD50 ≤ 5000
    mg kg−1. h GHS code that corresponds to the predicted LD50 calculated using the
    EPA TEST program. i GHS code that corresponds to the lowest LD50 calculated using
    the EPA test program for the major components of HLOME. Conventional aliphatic
    ether solvents have significant disadvantages. For example, THF has a low flashpoint,
    strong tendency to form peroxides, high miscibility in water resulting in difficult
    solvent recovery, high energy requirement for manufacture18,25 and is fossil-derived.
    MeTHF is a biomass-derived alternative to THF. However, it also has drawbacks
    such as low flash point, rapid peroxide formation, and difficult recovery from
    water.18 Cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME)18,26–28 is a greener and much safer alternative
    to THF. It has preferable characteristics such as a narrow explosion range, wide
    liquidity range, low rate of formation of peroxides, higher flash point and low
    solubility in water, but it is manufactured from fossil fuels. Ethereal solvents
    that, like CPME, do not form peroxides at a significant rate are particularly
    needed in applications where they may be exposed to oxidants.26,27 Because we
    do not have information about the health hazards of HLOME, we had to make some
    assumptions. First, we assumed that HLOME is no more flammable than its most volatile
    component, cyclohexyl methyl ether. However, flammability is the only hazard class
    measured for cyclohexyl methyl ether. As for the acute toxicity of HLOME, we list
    the GHS code that corresponds to the lowest of the predicted LD50 (rat, oral)
    values predicted by the EPA TEST program for the major components of the mixture.
    We therefore predict that HLOME should have acute toxicity and flammability comparable
    to other aliphatic ethers. HLOME is bioderived and has a very low peroxide formation
    rate. Currently, HLOME mixture has a high energy requirement for manufacture,
    in part because it was prepared on a gram scale. A fully developed, optimized,
    and scaled manufacturing process would likely have lower energy requirements.
    Conclusions A mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers (“HLOME”) was prepared from
    lignin pyrolysis oil via methylation, supercritical rectification, and catalytic
    hydrogenation. The final mixture was composed primarily of methoxycyclohexane,
    1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane. The cyclohexyl methyl ether
    mixture can be used as a solvent or oxygenate fuel additive. The Kamlet–Taft solvent
    properties of the mixture indicate that it is a suitable alternative to THF, dioxane,
    ethyl acetate, acetone and 2-butanone. Furthermore, the solvent does not form
    peroxides rapidly compared to cyclopentyl methyl ether and especially THF. For
    these reasons, HLOME can be considered a bioderived and safer alternative to petroleum
    derived ethereal solvents or as a fuel oxygenate. Now that the proof of concept
    has been achieved, future work will include the development of a more efficient
    conversion of lignin to HLOME, including the use of sulfur-free lignin so that
    the RANEY® nickel step becomes unnecessary, and a search for reaction conditions
    and methods to decrease the amount of reagents required to generate HLOME. Additionally,
    LOME and HLOME will be evaluated for various practical applications in which they
    could replace more harmful or less sustainable liquids. Experimental methods Softwood
    kraft lignin was obtained from FPInnovations and subjected to microwave pyrolysis
    at École Polytechnique de Montréal, Québec, Canada. DMC, sodium thiosulfate, anisole,
    veratrole, CPME, THF, starch, and QuantoFix test strips were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
    HPLC grade methanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, acetic acid, anhydrous sodium sulfate
    and hexanes were obtained from Fisher Chemicals. KI, KOH and RANEY® nickel were
    purchased from Alfa Aesar. DBU was obtained from TCI Chemicals. 5% Rh/C was purchased
    from Strem Chemicals. Chloroform-d was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories.
    CO2, H2 and argon were purchased from Praxair Inc. The equipment and method used
    for the rectification were described in Mudraboyina et al. Gas chromatography
    was performed using a PerkinElmer Clarus 680 Gas Chromatograph, a Clarus 600T
    Mass Spectrometer, capillary column Elite-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness;
    injector temperature 30 °C; carrier gas helium with a flow rate of 1 mL min−1;
    split flow 20 ml min−1; ion source 150 °C with EI of 70 eV; the MS scan range
    m/z 50–600. The oven temperature was ramped at 2.5 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 125
    °C and held for 1 min, then ramped at 20 °C min−1 and held at 260 °C for 1 min
    and finally ramped at 20 °C min−1 to 320 °C, with a dwell time of 3 min. NMR spectra
    were acquired using a Bruker 400.30 MHz spectrometer. UV/visible spectra were
    acquired using an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. IR spectra were acquired
    using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer. Methylation of LPO The methylation reactions
    were performed by a modification of the method reported by Mudraboyina et al.11
    LPO (25.54 g), dimethyl carbonate (125 ml), and DBU (31.25 ml) were combined in
    a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and a reflux condenser. The
    mixture was refluxed in an oil bath heated to 120 °C and stirred at 450 rpm overnight
    (approx. 20 h). Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature (22–25
    °C). The dimethyl carbonate was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining
    mixture was dissolved in 750 mL ethyl acetate and the resulting solution was washed
    with 3 × 150 mL 1 M aqueous HCl and then 3 × 150 mL brine. The organic phase was
    dried with Na2SO4 and decanted to remove the solids. Finally, the ethyl acetate
    was removed under reduced pressure to afford the methylated LPO with 97% retention
    of mass. Supercritical fluid rectification of methylated LPO The SFR of methylated
    LPO was performed by a modification of the procedure reported earlier.11 The methylated
    LPO sample (24.7 g) was placed into the 160 ml stainless steel reactor vessel
    which was then heated to 40 °C. The CO2 was chilled prior to entering the pump
    by a cooling jacket filled with 1 : 1 v : v ethylene glycol/water mixture maintained
    at a temperature of −11 °C. Liquid CO2 at a pressure of 8 MPa was passed through
    the liquid in the vessel at a flow rate of 8 ml min−1 and up through a rectification
    column packed with Dixon rings. The column had a temperature gradient of 37–95
    °C from bottom to top. The temperature gradient was established by heating the
    column in six different temperature zones with heating tape (37 °C, 43 °C, 56
    °C, 69 °C, 82 °C and 95 °C). A back-pressure regulator, connected to the top of
    the column was set to maintain a pressure of 8 MPa and was heated to 55 °C. A
    250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 75 mL acetone was placed under the outlet to
    collect the rectified material after the CO2 had vapourized. After 5 h, the contents
    of the Erlenmeyer flask were transferred to a 250 mL round bottom flask and the
    acetone was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the rectified, methylated
    LPO. The extract weighed 3.12 g (12.6% yield relative to the mass of methylated
    LPO). The composition of the mixture was analyzed by GC-MS. Hydrogenation of rectified
    ethers The sulfur present in LPO was removed using a RANEY® nickel slurry in alkaline
    water following the procedure described by Field et al.21 The RANEY® nickel (15.1
    g) was added to a 500 ml flask containing rectified ethers (3.12 g) and 210 ml
    of 7 : 3 acetone : H2O solution. The mixture was refluxed in an oil bath for 7
    h. Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The Ni was removed
    by gravity filtration and acetone was removed under vacuum. Rectified ethers were
    extracted with 125 ml of hexanes, dried with Na2SO4, and filtered to remove solids.
    Then the hexanes were evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a mixture of
    rectified desulfurized ether (1.82 g, 7.4%). The rectified and desulfurized ethers
    (1.82 g) were then dissolved in 54 mL hexanes and placed in a 100 ml glass insert
    with 0.182 g of 5% Rh/C and a stir bar. The vial was placed in a stainless-steel
    vessel, which was flushed 5 times with H2 to remove oxygen, then heated to 50
    °C and pressurized to 60 bar with H2. The mixture was stirred at 500 rpm for 24
    h. Then, the vessel was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The contents
    of the vial were passed through a Celite filter to remove the Rh/C and then the
    hexanes were evaporated using a rotary evaporator to afford hydrogenated ether
    mixture HLOME (1.37 g, 5.5%). Kamlet–Taft measurements The π* of HLOME was calculated
    from the average wavelength of maximum absorbance of solutions of 4-nitroanisole
    in HLOME at three different concentrations giving absorbances between 0.5 and
    2.5. The π* was then calculated from that average wavelength using eqn (1).22
    π* = 14.57 − 4270/λmax, OMe (1) Similarly, the β of HLOME was calculated from
    the average wavelength of maximum absorbance of solutions of 4-nitroaniline in
    HLOME at four different concentrations having absorbances between 0.3 and 1.6.
    The β value was then calculated from that average wavelength using eqn (2).22
    β = 11.134 − 3580/λmax,NH2 − 1.125π* (2) Peroxidation measurements Tetrahydrofuran
    was dried and stripped of inhibitor by refluxing over sodium benzophenone followed
    by distillation. Cyclopentyl methyl ether was purified by distillation. Cyclohexyl
    methyl ether was prepared from anisole using the hydrogenation procedure described
    above and purified by distillation. A portion of ethereal solvent was placed in
    a 20 ml dram amber vial under air. The vial was stored in a solvent cabinet with
    the lid firmly screwed on. All samples were opened and exposed to fresh air once
    a week. On the 12th week, the peroxide content was quantitatively determined by
    iodometry following the procedure described in Fábos et al.35 The peroxide content
    of HLOME was measured once and the average peroxide content in three samples were
    taken for other solvents. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest

    1. Introduction\nThe olive (Olea europaea L.) is an iconic tree linked to the\
    \ birth of some of the most\nancient civilizations [1–3] and one of the most important\
    \ cultivated tree species in the\nMediterranean basin. Moreover, the olive tree\
    \ is considered one of the best biological\nindicators of the Mediterranean climate\
    \ [1,2,4,5]. According to archaeological and genetic\nstudies, the olive tree\
    \ was probably domesticated from its wild ancestor, the oleaster\n(Olea europaea\
    \ ssp. europaea var. sylvestris), about 6000 years ago in the Middle East, in\
    \ an\narea between Turkey and Syria [1,6,7]. The olive tree as we know it today\
    \ results from\nselective breeding aimed at obtaining varieties without thorns\
    \ (present with small olives in\nthe oleaster trees) and fruits containing more\
    \ oil. The history of the olive is increasingly\nintertwined with that of the\
    \ people who learn to use and appreciate its main product, the\noil, ﬁrst used\
    \ only industrially for lighting and as an ointment, and then also as a food\n\
    product [8]. Olive growing shows a potential diversiﬁcation of its production,\
    \ and its\nmultifunctionality is demonstrated mainly by the types of products\
    \ it can provide: the main\nones are oil and table olives [9,10]. Olive cultivation\
    \ is widespread in ﬁfty-eight countries on\nﬁve continents. The consumption of\
    \ its products extends to 179 countries, thus showing an\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\

    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n2 of 33\nextremely localized production against a\
    \ dispersed demand in the international context [9].\nToday, olive crops cover\
    \ more than 12 million hectares [11] globally. Olive growing is\nroughly limited\
    \ by 30◦ to 45◦ parallels [12]. The primary producers of olives are Spain, Italy,\n\
    Greece, and Portugal, followed by other Mediterranean countries such as Tunisia,\
    \ Morocco,\nAlgeria, Egypt, and Turkey [11]. Among emerging producer countries,\
    \ Argentina, Peru,\nChile, and Australia are particularly noteworthy [11] (Figure\
    \ 1), where super-intensive\nolive groves, irrigated and highly mechanized, represent\
    \ the majority of newly cultivated\nareas [13]. Over the last few decades, given\
    \ the high socio-economic importance of the\nolive sector over the last few decades,\
    \ there has been much research involving Remote\nSensing (RS) applications in\
    \ olive growing, especially in precision agriculture (PA). As far\nas the use\
    \ of RS platforms such as satellites, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\n\
    in olive growing is concerned, a review of the literature showed the presence\
    \ of several\nworks devoted to it.\nOn the one hand, the increasing availability\
    \ of data and the possibility of using increas-\ningly higher-resolution imagery\
    \ helped make satellite the platform commonly associated\nwith RS in the ﬁrst\
    \ decade of the 2000s. On the other hand, technological advances have\naffected\
    \ UAVs over the last decade, making them a potential game-changer in PA applica-\n\
    tions [14], mounting sensors with centimeter spatial resolution and more independent\
    \ of\nclimatic variables [15]. In addition, UAVs have the unique feature of being\
    \ able to mount\nseveral types of sensors simultaneously [16].\nRS has the potential\
    \ to provide biodiversity information at the site, landscape, con-\ntinental,\
    \ and global spatial scale and offers itself as an inexpensive means of obtaining\n\
    comprehensive spatial coverage of updatable environmental information [17–20].\
    \ The\nspatial resolution image, increasing as technology advances in this ﬁeld,\
    \ provides data\non scales of individual tree canopies over a wide area. RS sensors\
    \ allow the detection of\nspecies or single trees and their density and land covers\
    \ due to high spatial resolution,\nwhich increases the accuracy of the data [21–23].\
    \ The potentialities of the application of RS\nin olive growing have concerned\
    \ so far several mapping and monitoring issues, such as the\nidentiﬁcation of\
    \ olive-cultivated areas and tree counting [24,25], evaluation of the effects\
    \ of\npruning strategies [26,27], plant phenotyping [28], as well as the relationship\
    \ between plant\nstructure and growth with irrigation and water stress [29], and\
    \ yield estimation [30–32].\nIn addition to purely agronomic issues, RS data helps\
    \ monitor the evolution of pathogens\nand phytophagous infections and, on a larger\
    \ scale, the olive landscape characteristics [33].\nWhat is also critical for\
    \ their environmental issues is managing wastewater produced by the\nolive oil\
    \ industry. Olive oil extraction generates enormous waste that signiﬁcantly impacts\n\
    terrestrial and aquatic environments [34]. In this framework, the role of RS platforms\
    \ can\nbe to monitor this source of underground pollution related to olive oil\
    \ waste disposal areas,\nwhich is considered a major environmental problem in\
    \ Mediterranean countries [35].\nThis review aims to cover the past, from the\
    \ 2000s onwards, and the most recent\napplications of RS in olive growing, focusing\
    \ on preserving the olive landscape and ad-\ndressing environmental issues. A\
    \ review of RS applications focusing on detecting and\ncounting trees, phenotyping,\
    \ yielding, detecting olive diseases, and managing pests in\nthe framework of\
    \ PA is reported in Messina and Modica [36]. The structure of the ﬁrst\npart of\
    \ this review is the following: Section 2 contains brief mentions of RS platforms\
    \ and\nsensors, mainly satellites and UAVs, used in research focused on olive\
    \ growing from the\nearly 2000s until now; Section 3 deals with the preservation\
    \ of olive landscape and soil\nerosion; Section 4 regards RS applications aiming\
    \ to identify and mapping olive groves;\nSection 5 is focused on monitoring and\
    \ management of olive oil mill wastewater (OOMW)\nand relative environmental risks;\
    \ Section 6 concerns irrigation water management and the\nuse of RS platforms\
    \ for water stress monitoring; ﬁnally, Section 7 contains discussions and\nconclusions\
    \ about the present—as well as future—challenges in the presented framework.\n\

    \ Sensors\n2.1. Satellites\nInitially, RS relied on aircraft-mounted photographic\
    \ instruments to capture Earth\nfeatures taking imagery ﬂying within a height\
    \ of 10 km above the ground [75]. Aerial\nplatforms proper include ﬁxed-wing aircraft,\
    \ helicopters, balloons, dirigibles, rockets, kites,\nparachutes, and in recent\
    \ times military-operated drones from which drones are derived\nfor civilian use,\
    \ the UAVs [14]. Before the advent of the well-known UAVs, several satellites\n\
    regularly provided data covering a wide spectral range, using both active and\
    \ passive\nsensors [76], acquiring data from different orbits and at different\
    \ spatial and temporal\nresolutions [77]. Satellites have been used for RS imagery\
    \ in agriculture since the early\n1970s [78], using a sensor mounted on the Landsat\
    \ 1 (also known as the Earth Resources\nTechnology Satellite—ERTS), launched in\
    \ 1972. Landsat 1 was followed by its improved\nversions (from Landsat 2 to 9,\
    \ the latter launched on 27 September 2021) and equipped\nwith sensors with increasing\
    \ higher performance in terms of bandwidth, radiometric and\nspatial resolution.\
    \ The satellite “evolved” from the initial 4 bands (green, red, and two\nnear-infrared—NIR-bands)\
    \ to the current 11 bands (coastal aerosol, blue, green, red, NIR,\nshort-wave\
    \ infrared (SWIR 1), and SWIR 2, panchromatic (PAN), cirrus and two thermal\n\
    bands). The spatial resolution increased from a maximum of 80 m of Landsat 1 to\
    \ 30 and\n15 m of the multispectral (MS) and panchromatic bands, respectively,\
    \ of Landsat 7, 8, and\n9 [79]. The Landsat historical archive was made freely\
    \ available in 2008 (for Landsat 7)\nand 2009 (for all archived Landsat scenes)\
    \ [80]. The beneﬁts of this decision can be seen\nin the use of Landsat imagery\
    \ in the multi-temporal monitoring of changes in land uses,\nconsidering an increased\
    \ awareness of the implications of rapid land use and cover changes\noccurring\
    \ in the landscape [75,81]. In olive growing-related research, Landsat imagery\n\
    was primarily used in land-use mapping and monitoring of sites of OOMW disposal\
    \ ar-\neas [40,47,71,82–85]. Images with lower resolution than Landsat are those\
    \ produced by\nTerra satellite’s sensor, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer\
    \ (MODIS), acquir-\ning at 250–500 m resolution data related to surface reﬂectance\
    \ and land surface temperature\n(LST) and emissivity, land cover/change, vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs), thermal anomalies and\nﬁre data, leaf area index (LAI), the fraction\
    \ of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR),\nnet primary vegetation production,\
    \ etc. [80]. Another Terra sensor, Advanced Spaceborne\nThermal Emission and Reﬂection\
    \ Radiometer (ASTER), equipped with 15 bands and includ-\ning some of them with\
    \ 15 m resolution, is suitable for the measurement of soil properties,\nvegetation\
    \ and crop monitoring, land temperatures, and generation of digital elevation\n\
    models (DEMs) [86]. In the framework of olive growing RS research, MODIS and ASTER\n\
    imagery was used to monitor canopies’ temperature, yield predicting, water stress,\
    \ and\nirrigation management [30,31,45,87,88].\nFollowing the period of “preeminence”\
    \ of the Landsat system, several private con-\nsortia developed, between the late\
    \ 90s and early 2000s, a new generation of satellites\nwith a high spatial resolution\
    \ (between 0.5 and 4 m) to open up new markets for satellite\nimagery [86]. Until\
    \ then, satellite imagery has proven cost-effective compared to aerial\nphotography\
    \ previously used for land use classiﬁcation over large regions [89]. How-\never,\
    \ coarse spatio-temporal resolution satellite imagery is not entirely adequate\
    \ for PA\napplications. Among the ﬁrst high-resolution systems launched and operated\
    \ by private\ncompanies were IKONOS and Quickbird. The IKONOS satellite system\
    \ was launched in\nSeptember 1999. It was the ﬁrst commercial satellite providing\
    \ submeter imagery with\n0.80 m resolution, using a PAN band or combined with\
    \ other bands to produce pansharp-\nened MS imagery. Quickbird was launched in\
    \ October 2001 and provided imagery at 0.60 m\nresolution, exploiting pansharpened\
    \ MS imagery and 2.4 m using MS bands [90]. With the\nhighest spatial resolution\
    \ available, pansharpening routines are widely used to optimize\nthe spectral\
    \ and spatial resolution of MS bands [91]. The availability of the ﬁrst images\n\
    provided by these two satellites allowed researchers to address issues that previously\
    \ could\nnot be studied from space or on the ground, such as individual mapping\
    \ canopies, as\nshown in research focused on detecting and counting olive trees\
    \ [92–95].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n7 of 33\nFor some years, IKONOS and Quickbird\
    \ satellites provided the highest resolution satel-\nlite imagery available to\
    \ the public before the advent of WorldView satellites (2007–2009)\nand GeoEye-1\
    \ (in 2008) [80]. These satellites provide PAN imagery at a resolution from\n\
    30 to 50 cm and MS imagery at less than 2 m [86]. GeoEye, WorldView-2, and -3\
    \ images\nwere used to detect OOMW disposal areas [57] and monitor olive trees’\
    \ health status using\nVIs [96,97]. Another important commercial source of data,\
    \ albeit limitedly used RS research\nin olive growing [41,98,99], is the Planetscope\
    \ constellation launched in the middle of the\npast decade. PlanetScope constellation\
    \ is composed of many small nano-satellites, 3U\nCubeSats, also called “Doves”\
    \ and equipped with MS sensors providing up to 3 m spatial\nresolution with a\
    \ one-day revisiting time [100,101].\nWhile commercial satellites are worthy of\
    \ consideration, the Sentinel constellations\noperated through the Copernicus\
    \ program proposed by the European Union (EU) and\nthe European Space Agency (ESA)\
    \ today play a signiﬁcant role. The Copernicus program\nincludes Sentinel-1′s\
    \ constellation, with two satellites using radar C-band, and Sentinel-2′s\nconstellation,\
    \ comprising two MS satellites, providing image resolution between 10 and\n60\
    \ m. Sentinel images are particularly suitable both for the monitoring of environmental\n\
    risks and for the needs of the agricultural and academic communities considering\
    \ the free\navailability of data to users together with its spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution [102–105].\nSentinel images have proven useful in monitoring the\
    \ health of olive groves by detecting\nwater stress symptoms in olive trees caused\
    \ by Verticillium dahliae Kleb. [106] and temporal\nvariations in the olive canopy\
    \ associated with Xylella fastidiosa’s symptoms [107,108].\nIn addition to Sentinel-1\
    \ radar images, Radarsat 2, COSMO-SkyMed, and TerraSAR-X\nsatellites were exploited\
    \ to map olive groves and characterize canopy biophysical param-\neters [109–111].\

    \ civil infrastructure inspection, monitoring\nof archaeological sites, environmental\
    \ monitoring, and applications in agriculture and\nforestry [112–117]. In agricultural\
    \ applications, UAVs’ use registered its spread over the\nlast decade [16].\n\
    UAVs are generally equipped with miniaturized and lower-cost versions than satellite\n\
    sensors. They include RGB, MS, thermal, hyperspectral cameras, and light-weight\
    \ LiDAR\n(light detection and ranging) sensors [118]. RGB sensors, on which many\
    \ RS applications\nin agriculture are based [119], were used, as shown in much\
    \ olive-related research, for\ntree canopy detection and tree counting [24,32,120–122],\
    \ characterization of tree dimension\nparameters [27,123–128], and health monitoring\
    \ [129]. These are relatively low-cost, high-\nresolution sensors but may be inadequate\
    \ if not coupled with other types of sensors [112].\nAn alternative involves modifying\
    \ RGB sensors to capture images on bands such as Red\nEdge and NIR, avoiding the\
    \ higher costs of purchasing MS cameras [119]. MS cameras\nbeing able to operate\
    \ on other bands, such as Red Edge and NIR, can be exploited for\nmonitoring plant\
    \ physiological status by detecting drought and heat stress, the health status\n\
    in general, nutrient content, and plant biomass [48,130–135]. Multiple bands allow\
    \ more\nVIs to be exploited to highlight vegetation’s vigor and other vegetation\
    \ properties [136]\n(Table 1). In addition, MS UAV imagery is used for phenotyping;\
    \ detecting olive trees based\non pixel or object-based image analysis (OBIA);\
    \ assessing olive tree parameters such as\nheight, diameter, and volume [25,28,29,123,127,137,138];\
    \ and monitoring them in terms of\nspectral behavior.\nThermal UAV cameras provide\
    \ data of great agronomic relevance considering the\nabsence of high-resolution\
    \ satellite thermal sensors. Thermal sensors capture information\nabout the temperature\
    \ of objects by generating images that display them based on their\ntemperature,\
    \ not on their visible properties [119]. Therefore thermal RS, when used on the\n\
    vegetation, allows for identifying the leaf surface’s thermal alterations due\
    \ to physiological\nchanges induced by water stress [112]. Several researches\
    \ focused on the ﬁeld characteriza-\ntion of water stress in olive groves [139–143],\
    \ and a few [144,145] correlated olive canopy\ntemperature to the water stress\
    \ symptoms to detect infected plants by Verticillium Wilt.\nHyperspectral sensors\
    \ capture data in hundreds of bands providing high volumes\nof information in\
    \ agriculture and forestry [146,147]. However, the use of these sensors\nmounted\
    \ on UAVs is affected by some limitations: higher spectral resolution but lower\n\
    spatial resolution if compared, for example, to RGB sensors; read spectral ranges\
    \ halved\nwhen compared to aircraft-mounted sensors due to weight limitations;\
    \ higher cost [118]. In\naddition, hyperspectral sensors, similarly to and more\
    \ so than MS sensors, may require\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n9 of 33\nmore\
    \ complex data pre-processing methods to extract information [119]. The difﬁculties\n\
    linked to UAV hyperspectral use can explain the lack of much olive-related work\
    \ [148].\nLiDAR, mainly used for terrestrial scanning, has been used for aerial\
    \ scanning since\n1994, when commercial systems became available. LiDAR is an\
    \ active RS system emitting\npulses whose return to the sensor after being reﬂected\
    \ by an “object” of the terrestrial\nsurface is measured by calculating the time\
    \ elapsed between the emission of the energy\npulse and its return [86]. From\
    \ this information, it is obtained a cloud of points with X, Y,\nand Z coordinates\
    \ that corresponds to the impacts of the initial pulse energy on the Earth’s\n\
    surface objects, thus making it possible to reconstruct the structure of trees\
    \ with high\nprecision digitally [26,149,150]. LiDAR sensors are known to be very\
    \ accurate for acquiring\ngeometric data, such as those referring to tree canopies,\
    \ many of which are carried out in\nforestry [151,152]. 3D models obtained from\
    \ LiDAR surveys can also be helpful in agriculture,\nwith applications similar\
    \ to those used in forest areas. As the geometric characteristics of\ntrees are\
    \ directly related to tree growth and productivity, they can be important indicators\
    \ for\nestimating growth, yield prediction, and water consumption [153]. However,\
    \ even those with\na relatively low cost are still more expensive than RGB cameras\
    \ and require higher payloads\n(up to a few kilograms) [119,154]. For these reasons,\
    \ the LiDAR system is not as readily\naccessible as other UAV-based photogrammetric\
    \ mapping systems [118].\n3. Preservation of the Olive Landscape and Soil Erosion\n\
    The olive grove can be considered an essential and historical component of the\
    \ Mediter-\nranean landscape mosaic, especially in Italy, Spain, and Greece [155–157].\
    \ The landscape\nhas the constant trait in this species, while other characters\
    \ are given by different envi-\nronmental and cultural expressions such as climate,\
    \ land geomorphology, and cultivation\ntechniques. The climate is a relatively\
    \ limiting factor considering the spread in recent\ndecades of olive growing even\
    \ in areas far from those “historical” cultivation [158]. Just\nthink of the growing\
    \ importance that olive cultivation is acquiring in the countries of South\nAmerica\
    \ (Argentina, Chile) and Australia [159]. As for the geomorphology, this is closely\n\
    linked to both the olive groves localization and the cultivation techniques adopted,\
    \ and\nexamples of this are the traditional terraced olive groves typical of hilly-mountainous\
    \ and\nmarginal areas of Greece’s and Italy’s regions, conversely, contrasted\
    \ by location, planting,\nand management to the super-intensive olive groves in\
    \ Spain (or Australia) spread in\nrecent decades [160]. The protection of the\
    \ cultivated landscape, speciﬁcally that of the\nolive tree, must be pursued by\
    \ complying with opposing requirements: opportunity for\nprotection through conservation\
    \ (even with the introduction of compensatory mechanisms)\nor freedom to organize\
    \ the factors of production by appropriately modifying the productive\nassets\
    \ and, inevitably, landscape [161]. For example, in opposition to the advancement\
    \ of in-\ntensive olive growing in some areas, in others, the olive landscape’s\
    \ detriment is caused by\nurbanization’s effects on agricultural land [157]. It\
    \ is often overlooked that olive represents\na typical crop with mixed urban-rural\
    \ settlements, which provides environmental services\nand biodiversity conservation\
    \ and represents an integral part of periurban landscapes\nwhile also supporting\
    \ rural economies and tourism development [3]. The adverse effects of\nthe urban\
    \ sprawl on agricultural land were covered by Doygun [162], which quantiﬁed the\n\
    loss of agricultural land, and olive land cover in particular, in a location in\
    \ Turkey, from\n1985, using aerial imagery, to 2006, using IKONOS’ image (panchromatic),\
    \ and Quickbird\nimage (pansharpened). Three speciﬁc periods were analyzed and\
    \ compared (1985–2000,\n2000–2004, and 2004–2006), starting by superimposing the\
    \ olive groves digitized in the\n1985 aerial photographs on 2000 urban area images.\
    \ The data obtained showed a loss of\n25% of the area initially occupied by olive\
    \ groves due to a progressive abandonment of\nagricultural practices in favor\
    \ of new residential building construction.\nOne challenge of RS is to effectively\
    \ assess the impact of agriculture in risk situations\nconcerning soil erosion\
    \ and environmental conservation [163]. Soil erosion represents one\nof the principal\
    \ environmental issues associated with olive growing in Mediterranean\ncountries,\
    \ mainly in hilly areas characterized by more or less accentuated slopes [164,165].\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n10 of 33\nThe evolution of soil erosion in olive\
    \ groves ﬁnds in its causes both their expansion and\nchanges in soil management\
    \ techniques [166]. Soil erosion can cause several negative\nenvironmental impacts,\
    \ including a reduction in production, risk of desertiﬁcation, and\nrun-off with\
    \ soil transport, fertilizer residues, and herbicides into water bodies [166].\
    \ Soil\nerosion depends on the combination of soil characteristics, slope, rainfall\
    \ patterns, and the\nuse of inappropriate agricultural practices [167]. Mechanical\
    \ tillage is still the most widely\nused practice for soil management as it improves\
    \ not only the inﬁltration capacity but also\nthe distribution of water in the\
    \ soil proﬁle and contributes to the burial of fertilizers, the\nprevention of\
    \ ﬁres, and the removal of weeds [168–170]. However, the continued use of\nthis\
    \ practice, in the long run, can cause opposite and harmful effects on soil destructuring,\n\
    reduction of water inﬁltration rate, reduction of water availability in the rhizosphere,\n\
    and soil compaction with consequent loss of nutrients and organic matter depriving\
    \ it of\nprotection from torrential rains [42,167,171]. Cover crops shield soil\
    \ from the driving rain\nwhile increasing inﬁltration and reducing surface sealing\
    \ [172–174].\nFurthermore, vegetation cover promotes more bacterial diversity,\
    \ which can be con-\nsidered a biological indicator of soil quality [175]. As\
    \ highlighted by Lima-Cueto et al. [42],\nthe role of vegetation cover is acknowledged\
    \ in the cross-compliance system of the EU\nCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) (Regulation\
    \ No. 1306/2013). Lima-Cueto et al. [42]\nexploited RS for quantifying cover crops\
    \ (CC) in olive groves where CC contributes to\nimproving soil fertility and water\
    \ retention while reducing erosion risk. For this purpose,\nthe authors tested\
    \ several VIs, chosen from those contained in their formula, the bands\nGreen,\
    \ Red, Red Edge, and NIR, to verify their capacity to quantify the density of\
    \ cover\ncrops in olive groves using UAV imagery. Results showed that the Inverse\
    \ Ratio Vegetation\nIndex (IRVI, given by the ratio of Red to NIR) [39] was the\
    \ most sensitive for quantifying CC\ndensity at intervals of 10–25%. Given its\
    \ impact on soil conservation in sloping farmlands,\nLima et al. [163] used UAV\
    \ MS data and DEMs to map differences in tillage using OBIA\nclassiﬁcation techniques.\
    \ Authors automatically classiﬁed tillage furrows and computed\ntheir main direction\
    \ testing this procedure on twenty olive groves characterized by a wide\nrange\
    \ of tree sizes, soil tones, plot shapes, and soil slopes.\nKarydas et al. [137]\
    \ investigated soil erosion risk mapped in Creta (Greece) caused by\nthe intensiﬁcation\
    \ of olive growing. As in other regions of the Mediterranean, long periods\nof\
    \ drought followed by heavy rainfall favor erosion on steep slopes and with shallow\
    \ and\nfragile soils. In this regard, the use of terraces and the presence of\
    \ rural roads perpendicular\nto the direction of the slope helps to divide the\
    \ length of the slope and slow down the runoff\nprocess, improving water penetration.\
    \ Erosion is related to the speed with which water\npasses or inﬁltrates the soil\
    \ and the generation of runoff, the leading cause of soil loss [165].\nThe authors\
    \ used Quickbird imagery, a DEM, a geologic map, and rainfall data collected by\n\
    two meteorological stations. The research aimed to quantify the supporting practice\
    \ factor\n(P) in the spatial domain and its incorporation into the Revised Universal\
    \ Soil Loss Equation\n(RUSLE) formula. RUSLE is a revised version of the model-based\
    \ method Universal Soil\nLoss Equation (USLE) used for quantifying the risk of\
    \ soil erosion [176]. P factor depends\non the mapping landscape’s features indicative\
    \ of existing support measures (terraces) or\nconditions that prevent soil erosion\
    \ (rural roads and paths). P factor was quantiﬁed using\nvisual photointerpretation\
    \ for an overall image interpretation and object-oriented image\nanalysis for\
    \ semi-automatically mapping terraces and rural roads. A soil erosion risk map\n\
    was produced, attributing differentiated values to the P factor.\nTerraces perform\
    \ an essential service by leveling the soil surface and stabilizing slopes,\n\
    resulting in better water inﬁltration and reduced erosion risk. In addition, terraces\
    \ increase\nlandscape diversity and function as habitats and biodiversity corridors\
    \ [177]. Conversely,\nthe abandonment of terraces may cause an aggravation of\
    \ the eroding process [178–180].\nConsidering the aspects mentioned so far, Diaz-Varela\
    \ et al. [143] proposed a low-cost\nmethodology for automatically classifying\
    \ agricultural terraces (with permanent crops such\nas olive trees) using high-resolution\
    \ imagery acquired by a low-cost UAV equipped with\nnon-metric cameras. In the\
    \ context of CAP monitoring, these objectives address the need to\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 5430\n11 of 33\ndevelop reliable and repeatable methods for automatically\
    \ classifying landscape elements\nthat perform an ecosystem service. The UAV imagery\
    \ was acquired and pre-processed\nwithout ground control points for reducing ﬂight\
    \ planning costs and user interaction. The\nclassiﬁcation of terraces and no-terraces\
    \ was based only on the spectral and elevation data\nderived from imagery and\
    \ exploiting 3D photo-reconstruction methods.\nFernández et al. [181] used UAVs\
    \ high-resolution imagery to analyze the evolution\nof a landslide affecting olive\
    \ groves in Southern Spain. The proposed method allows a\nmonitoring analysis\
    \ by calculating differential Digital Surface Models (DSMs) to measure\nvertical\
    \ displacements and identify depletion and accumulation areas inside the landslide.\n\
    DSMs of different epochs were compared to monitor landslides to reach this objective:\n\
    head and depletion area, primary and secondary scarp, body, toe, and accumulation\
    \ area.\nMoreover, the estimation of vertical displacements in areas not covered\
    \ by vegetation\nwas performed. This work proved that UAVs could estimate vertical\
    \ and horizontal\nlandslide displacement changes based on DSM and Digital Terrain\
    \ Model (DTM). Both\nmodels and orthophotos at different epochs were obtained\
    \ from UAV surveys using a\nmethodology based on conventional photogrammetry and\
    \ Structure from Motion (SfM)\ntechniques. The results allowed the characterization\
    \ of the slope movement ﬂow rate and\nsome morphological features (crown, scarps,\
    \ head, lateral limits, tension cracks, foot, etc.)\non a hillslope of hectometric\
    \ dimensions.\nPart of the ecosystem functions of olive groves, especially traditional\
    \ ones, is the\ncritical contribution to animal and plant biodiversity even when\
    \ they are present in areas\ndominated by other land uses, such as arable land\
    \ and forests where, among other things,\nolive groves can also serve as ﬁrebreaks\
    \ [167]. In particular, the biological activity and biodi-\nversity are generally\
    \ higher in undisturbed olive groves semi-abandoned or those managed\naccording\
    \ to modern techniques of conservation agriculture [182]. Tscheulin et al. [85]\
    \ high-\nlighted the olive tree’s function in preserving biodiversity in Mediterranean\
    \ environments.\nThe authors analyzed the inﬂuence of the surrounding landscape,\
    \ in particular olive groves,\non the presence of three size groups of bees. Depending\
    \ on the size of the bees and the\ndistance they can cover, the use of resources\
    \ such as pollen occurs on different spatial\nscales. The landscape around the\
    \ study area was assessed using thematic maps based on\nthe satellite image Landsat\
    \ 5 and classifying land according to eight land cover categories.\nAmong these,\
    \ the olive grove class positively impacted the abundance of bees.\nTable 3 shows\

    \ Mapping of Olive Groves\nLand use is a coupled human-environment system that\
    \ describes how the land is\nmanaged [75]. Land-cover mapping and monitoring represent\
    \ one of the main applications\nof Earth-observing RS sensors data and are crucial\
    \ for estimating land cover change [185].\nPhoto interpreters can use RS data\
    \ for deriving land use information by using patterns,\ntextures, or shapes [186].\
    \ Researchers recognized the importance of mapping land use and\ncreating databases\
    \ for sustainable natural resource management on local, regional, and\nnational\
    \ scales [187,188]. In addition, knowledge of soil’s physical, biological, and\
    \ chemical\nproperties allows for the design and implementation of essential operations\
    \ in PA, such\nas irrigation, drainage, nutrient, and other crop management strategies\
    \ [89]. Furthermore,\nthe importance of determining land uses is related, for\
    \ example, to European ﬁnancial\nsupport to agricultural producers via several\
    \ subsidies [189], the implementation of speciﬁc\nagro-environmental measures,\
    \ and the assessment of the impacts of existing management\nand policies at regional\
    \ and national scales. An example of the ﬁrst research in the early\n2000s concerning\
    \ this topic on olive groves was given by De Bruin [82], which presented\nan approach\
    \ for predicting the areal extent of land cover types. In particular, the author\n\
    proposed a geostatistical method to model spatial uncertainty in estimating the\
    \ area extent\nof land cover types (including olive groves) derived from Landsat\
    \ Thematic Mapper data.\nBased on the European Union and national regulations\
    \ for the subsidy of the creation of\ncover crops between rows of olive groves,\
    \ Peña-Barragán et al. [64] evaluated RS techniques\nfor a rapid and accurate\
    \ assessment of cover crops in olive groves at a farm and regional\nlevel. The\
    \ objectives of this research included determining the suitable time of the year\
    \ for\ntaking aerial photographs and the better VIs for discriminating different\
    \ land uses. Results\nshowed that the cover crop could not be distinguished from\
    \ olive trees in spring, while\nboth can be distinguished from bare soil. Regarding\
    \ the detection of olive trees, among\nthe VIs obtained by combining the Blue,\
    \ Red, Green, and NIR bands, the best proved to\nbe the following ratio: R/(B+G),\
    \ able to detect olive trees in summer with an accuracy\nof almost 93%. Similar\
    \ results in terms of accuracy were obtained in [65], developing a\nland cover\
    \ classiﬁcation using satellite imagery. In this case, based on the use of Quickbird\n\
    images, the following objectives were pursued: selecting VIs for distinguishing\
    \ each land\ncover; deﬁning image processing sequences to automatically complete\
    \ the separation and\nquantiﬁcation of each land cover, among which olive groves.\
    \ Land cover was randomly\ndetermined and georeferenced, carrying out ﬁeld inspections\
    \ to validate the classiﬁcation\nprocedure by tracing training zones to deﬁne\
    \ the digital boundary values used in the\nclassiﬁcation routines. Classiﬁed regions\
    \ were created with each land cover or grouping\nof land covers with similar digital\
    \ value characteristics. The following bands, band ratios,\nand VIs were tested\
    \ to discriminate land covers: Blue, Green, Red, NIR, Ratio Vegetation\nIndex\
    \ (RVI) [190], Blue/Green, Blue/Red, Red/Green, NIR/Blue, NIR/Green, Normalized\n\
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [56], Adapted Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index\
    \ (ASAVI)\nand Adapted Burnt Area Index (ABAI). A supervised classiﬁcation method\
    \ was employed\nto distinguish land covers by creating classiﬁed regions deﬁned\
    \ using the digital boundary\nvalues. In the case of olive groves cover class,\
    \ it was identiﬁed by deleting the area resulting\nfrom the merging of the three\
    \ classes’ vegetation (consisting of the spring-sown herbaceous\ncrops and vineyards\
    \ plus roadside trees classes), non-vegetation (consisting of the bare\nagricultural\
    \ soil and urban soil plus highways classes) and non-burnt stubble. Olive groves’\n\
    cover crops were estimated by exploiting the NDVI to discriminate the olive trees\
    \ and the\nBlue/Red ratio to discriminate cover crops, as shown in [64].\nWeissteiner\
    \ et al. [191] showed another methodology for classifying olive groves accord-\n\
    ing to management intensity using agro-economic (such as yields) and ecological\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., ground coverage and tree density). The input data were derived\
    \ from a long-term time\nseries of NOAA AVHRR (Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer\
    \ of National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration) and calculation of the\
    \ index Green Vegetation Fraction\n(GVF, [192]). Vegetation variables were derived\
    \ from the parametrization of a long-term RS\ntime series of GVF using a model\
    \ called SINFIT. This model obtains parameters for quantifying\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 5430\n13 of 33\nthe component of permanent vegetation and that which changes\
    \ seasonally. These parameters\nallow classifying the olive grove according to\
    \ the intensity of management.\nTorkashvand and Shadparvar [193] focus on identifying\
    \ and mapping olive in Iran’s\nRoodbar region using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS)\
    \ images and GIS. Two methods were\nused: providing spectral reﬂectance stochastic\
    \ (DN) of different land covers and supervised\nclassiﬁcation for discriminating\
    \ olive groves from other land covers. For the ﬁrst method, a\ntraining map was\
    \ prepared and superimposed on a color composite sample consisting of\nthree bands.\
    \ In supervised classiﬁcation, four methods were used: Box Classiﬁer, Maximum\n\
    Likelihood, Minimum Distance, and Minimum Mahalanobis distance. Dense olive groves\n\
    were differentiated from low-dense groves. The results showed less accuracy and\
    \ precision\nin classifying low-density olive groves due to the interference of\
    \ the spectral signature of\nthe canopies with those of other vegetation and soil\
    \ cover.\nThe monitoring of land use over time and, in particular, the abandonment\
    \ of olive\ngrowing or the reduction of land has been addressed by Efe et al.\
    \ [83], which investigated\nland-use change on olive tree cultivation in the Edremit\
    \ region in the northwest of Turkey.\nThis research focused on the relationship\
    \ between the natural environment and humans\nover three decades (1979–2006).\
    \ Both historical maps and satellite imagery provided the\ndata. In detail, topographic\
    \ maps at 1:25,000 scale were used for land use determination in\n1979, while\
    \ Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were used for land\nuse\
    \ determination in 2006. Field surveys were carried out to conﬁrm land use. Changes\
    \ in\nolive areas were determined by overlaying the surveyed data from 1979 and\
    \ 2006. These\ndata were overlayed with DEM to show changes in the olive groves\
    \ according to the\nelevation levels. The tabular data expressed in hectares showed\
    \ that in cases where areas\noccupied by olive groves were allocated to other\
    \ agricultural uses, almost 74% of these areas\nwere located at an altitude between\
    \ 0 and 100 m. Moreover, the highest percentage (nearly\n98%) in converting olive\
    \ groves into residential areas is on the coast (0–100 m). This resulted\nin the\
    \ centralization of olive groves located in marginal lands with severe productive\
    \ use\nlimitations, soil limitations, high altitude variation, and unfavorable\
    \ ecological conditions.\nGhaderpour et al. [61] monitored vegetation variation\
    \ (olive groves) through the\nleast-squares wavelet analysis (LSWA), a time series\
    \ analysis method developed by [194].\nFour regions of Tunisia with different\
    \ characteristics have been chosen: the ﬁrst region was\nselected to study the\
    \ relationship between the olive tree growth rate and temperature and\nprecipitation;\
    \ the second region was selected because it was occupied by a forest area that\n\
    faces substantial degradation due to anthropogenic activities; the third region\
    \ was selected\nbecause it was affected by the growth of salt-loving plants and\
    \ a large number of migrant\nbirds; the fourth region was chosen due to the vegetation\
    \ cover degradation caused by the\nurban sprawl. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic\
    \ Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images,\nacquired for the period from 2000 to 2018,\
    \ were used to create the NDVI time series. The\nresults showed that NDVI time\
    \ series of olive tree vegetation are highly coherent with\ntemperature and precipitation\
    \ time series.\nTable 4 shows the researches in RS in olive growing dealing with\

    The olive oil industry is crucial in Mediterranean countries, being a source of\
    \ wealth\nand tradition and one of the fundamental sectors of agriculture in these\
    \ countries [34].\nHowever, the extraction of olive oil produces a considerable\
    \ quantity of waste harmful\nto the terrestrial and aquatic environment due to\
    \ its phytotoxicity representing a critical\nenvironmental issue, especially in\
    \ Mediterranean areas [195]. The extraction of olive oil\nconsists of washing\
    \ the olives, grinding, beating, and the extraction itself, representing the\n\
    fundamental phase of the entire process [196]. Waste from oil mills can be divided\
    \ into\nsolid, olive husks, and a liquid component, OOMW [40]. The speciﬁc physicochemical\n\
    characteristics of OOMW are variable, depending on climatic conditions, the cultivars\
    \ from\nwhich the oil comes, the degree of ripeness of the olives, storage times,\
    \ and the type of\nextraction [197–199]. The effects of OOMW on physicochemical\
    \ soil properties also depend\non the quantity, the time, the spreading method,\
    \ and the surface slope [200]. OOMW could\nbe temporarily stored in evaporation\
    \ ponds or lagoons and then distributed evenly over\nagricultural land [201–204].\
    \ In European countries, the direct discharge of OOMW into\nrivers, lakes, sewer\
    \ systems, and soils is strictly prohibited because of its harmful effects\non\
    \ the ecological balance [205]. However, this ban is often not respected. The\
    \ impact of\nOOMW on aquatic ecosystems caused by phenols release, eutrophication,\
    \ dissolved oxygen\nreduction, and pH alterations are well known [206,207]. On\
    \ the other hand, inﬁltration of\nvegetation water into the soil affects carbonate\
    \ distribution and can change pH, electrical\nconductivity, and nutrient content\
    \ [40]. In soils covered by crops, OOMW causes many\nmicroorganisms’ inhibition,\
    \ reduced seed germination, and altered soil characteristics such\nas porosity\
    \ and humus concentration [208]. To minimize environmental impact, OOMW\nmust\
    \ be processed. In this regard, research is oriented toward developing treatment\n\
    technologies through physical, chemical, and biological processes [209]. Regarding\
    \ the\nsolution involving distribution on agricultural land, research found that\
    \ OOMW application\nperforms a positive effect on soil properties, if applied\
    \ at controlled rates [210–214]. For\nexample, as highlighted by Koutsos et al.\
    \ [215], the adoption of sustainable practices can\nconvert OOMW from a pollutant\
    \ to a valuable resource, useful as an amendment in the\ncontext of sustainable\
    \ agriculture. In this framework and concerning the problem described\nabove,\
    \ the RS can help detect OOMW disposal areas. The identiﬁcation of the ground\n\
    investigation is long and expensive [34]. In this regard, several researches have\
    \ included the\nuse of satellites providing medium and high-resolution imagery\
    \ to achieve this objective [34,\n38,40,47,57]. Alexakis et al. [40,47] developed\
    \ an integrated geoinformatics approach for\nmonitoring the land pollution in\
    \ Crete (Greece) caused by the OOMW disposal. The proposed\napproach includes\
    \ three steps: satellite RS data acquisition and processing (Landsat 8 OLI and\n\
    IKONOS), geophysical prospection, soil/water sampling/chemical analysis. Firstly,\
    \ mapping\nwas carried out, detecting about 1300 OOMW tanks (topographically mapped).\
    \ Hundreds\nof OOMW disposal areas were detected by using high-resolution satellite\
    \ images of Google\nEarth, and more than 1000 sites were visited to record their\
    \ position. Some different VIs were\ntested to evaluate their ability to identify\
    \ disposal areas. The authors also proposed a detection\nindex (DI) to improve\
    \ the disposal areas’ spectral response in Landsat’s images. Results\nshowed that\
    \ Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) [44] and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) [39]\n\
    performed best. However, the spectral variance of OOMW makes their classification\
    \ and\ndetection difficult because of the mixed pixel phenomenon. Agapiou et al.\
    \ [38] analyzed the\nspectral variance of the different components of olive oil\
    \ wastes to identify the most suitable\nspectral windows for their detection.\
    \ In particular, they tested GeoEye 1 imagery coupled with\nspectroradiometric\
    \ ground measurements (between 350 and 1050 nm). Separability analysis\nshowed\
    \ that Blue and NIR bands represent the two optimal wavelengths “regions” for\
    \ OOMW\ndetection. The Blue Normalized difference vegetation index (BNDVI) [37],\
    \ including in its\nformula Blue and NIR bands, was proposed for detecting OOMW\
    \ disposal areas.\nAgapiou et al. [57] investigated the potential suitability\
    \ of very high-resolution satellite\nimages (Pléiades, SPOT 6, Quickbird, WorldView-2,\
    \ GeoEye 1) with a spatial resolution\nbetween 0.4 m and 1.5 m for detecting OOMW\
    \ disposal areas by testing two indices:\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n15 of 33\n\
    NDVI and BNDVI. The tests showed that OOMW disposal areas, characterized by low\n\
    values of both indices, can be recognized in most satellite images as black targets.\
    \ In\naddition to optical satellite images, the COSMO-SkyMed radar image was preliminarily\n\
    tested and fused with the hyperspectral Earth Observing-1 Advanced Land Imagery\
    \ with\na medium resolution image (30 m), proving its potential suitability for\
    \ the detection of\nOOMW disposal areas, although it needs further studies.\n\
    Issaoui et al. [41] tested imagery of satellites Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope for\
    \ monitoring\nOOMW disposal sites in two sites in Tunisia and Greece. Some VIs,\
    \ NDVI, Normalized\nDifference Water Index (NDWI) [216], and DI were tested to\
    \ evaluate their efﬁciency\nin detecting OOMW disposal areas. Image processing\
    \ methods, false-color composites\n(FCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\
    \ and image fusion were applied to satellite\nimages with the aim of improving\
    \ the monitoring of OOMW ponds. The classiﬁcation\nalgorithms ISODATA, the Maximum\
    \ Likelihood, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nwere used to assist in the\
    \ overall approach of detection. Results showed that the optimum\nbands for monitoring\
    \ OOMW are the NIR bands. PlanetScope imagery proved to be\nideal for monitoring\
    \ disposal sites, and Sentinel’s medium-resolution (but free) images\ndemonstrated\
    \ to be used in some cases with successful results for this purpose.\nKarydas\
    \ et al. [217] developed a methodology that allows for a dynamic cause–effect\n\
    linking of pollution sources and affected areas through OOMW pathways. Dataset\
    \ used\nincluded a Quickbird image, a DEM, and olive oil production data. The\
    \ ﬁrst step of the\nmethodology involves the creation of a database including\
    \ possible sources of pollution\n(oil mills and tanks, mapped with photo-interpretation\
    \ of false-color band composition\nQuickbird’s image), and hydrogeological characteristics\
    \ of the territory; determination\nof a set of risk parameters on the source scale\
    \ by assigning to each source a risk value\ncalculated by Multi-Criteria Analysis\
    \ and Simple Additive Weighting method; allocation of\nall potentially impacted\
    \ sites in the streams (receptor scale), calculating the risk values at\nthe allocated\
    \ sites by summing up the risk values of the sources for each of the impacted\n\
    sites; calculation of the risk values for each watershed, summarizing risk values\
    \ of the\nimpacted sites included in the speciﬁc watershed. The result produced\
    \ an assessment of\nthe environmental risk caused by mill wastes at three different\
    \ scales starting from the\npossible sources of pollution (mill units or wastewater\
    \ tanks) to the mapping of impacted\nstream sites and ﬁnally considering the watershed\
    \ as a whole.\nGiven the potential damage that OOMW can cause to aquatic ecosystems,\
    \ Elhag et al. [218]\nmapped and evaluated the environmental pollution risks caused\
    \ by OOMW discharged into\nsurface stream networks. Firstly, the authors detected\
    \ source points of pollution by visual\nphotointerpretation using Quickbird’s\
    \ images. Land cover data and DEM were used to produce\na hydrological model in\
    \ which the prior location of the steepest downhill neighbor for each\npixel of\
    \ the DEM allows for the definition of the direction of movement of a water droplet\
    \ from\neach pixel of the DEM. In this way, it was possible to simulate the surface\
    \ movement of the\nOOMW according to the area’s topography. The stream power index\
    \ (SPI) was used to detect\nflat drainage areas susceptible to sedimentation.\n\

    \ Water Management\nAlthough olive trees are drought-tolerant species with speciﬁc\
    \ anatomical adaptations\nand physiological mechanisms which allow for maintaining\
    \ their vital functions under\nextreme stress [219], their distribution in arid\
    \ regions is limited by annual rainfall of\nless than 350 mm, and water availability\
    \ is an essential resource for improving ﬁnal\nyields [158,220]. Therefore, rainfall’s\
    \ fundamental role in the economic proﬁtability of\nthis crop is evident, which\
    \ can be exacerbated by arid summers [221]. In the typical\nMediterranean areas\
    \ of cultivation, where the climate is characterized by low and highly\nvariable\
    \ precipitation during the growing season and high potential evaporation, the\
    \ lack of\nwater is the main limiting factor for both the growth and productivity\
    \ of the crop [8,222,223].\nThe characteristics of the soil also play an essential\
    \ role in retaining water and thus in the\ngrowth of the olive tree [223]. Although\
    \ it has adapted to poor, shallow soils, the olive tree\nprefers fertile, deep\
    \ soils with moderate water content [12]. Indeed the olive groves mainly\npresent\
    \ on marginal soils with low water retention capacity and poor nutrient levels\
    \ are\ncharacterized by compromised development and low yields [224]. Water stress\
    \ can cause\nnegative consequences, including low leaf area, limited photosynthesis,\
    \ low ﬂowering and\nfruiting, ﬂower abortion, and cluster abscission [158,225].\n\
    Irrigation exploited to achieve greater production and economic competitiveness\n\
    started to spread in the early 2000s and be used in traditional and modern olive\
    \ groves show-\ning positive effects on yield, fruit size, pulp-to-stone ratio,\
    \ and oil content [220,222,226–230].\nThe high plant density, the scarcity of\
    \ water resources for irrigation, and the high rainfall\nvariability from year\
    \ to year make localized irrigation and water deﬁcit irrigation strategies\nnecessary\
    \ to maintain acceptable production levels [13,231]. Among the advantages of\n\
    localized irrigation are the reduction of irrigation volumes because the entire\
    \ soil surface\nis not irrigated. Consequently, the water savings can be used\
    \ to increase the irrigated\narea or allocated to other uses [165]. However, to\
    \ save water resources in agriculture, it is\nessential to improve water productivity,\
    \ which corresponds to the ratio of yield (marketable\nproduct or net income)\
    \ to the water used by the crop [232–234]. In woody crops such\nas olives, for\
    \ which the production objective is not biomass, the most signiﬁcant water\nproductivity\
    \ can be achieved with water deﬁcit irrigation rather than full irrigation [235].\n\
    Deﬁcit irrigation strategies are becoming widely used in modern olive groves to\
    \ improve\nyield while maintaining low water consumption [236]. Optimizing water\
    \ deﬁcit irrigation\ninvolves obtaining the best balance between yield, olive\
    \ oil quality, and irrigation water\nsavings [236,237]. Among the advantages of\
    \ the irrigation deﬁcit, one is the improvement\nof the quality and derivatives\
    \ of the fruits (such as olive oil) and the control of growth\nthat allows reducing\
    \ the intensity of pruning as well as the need for phytosanitary treat-\nments\
    \ [223,235,238]. In this framework, precision irrigation is well suited to the\
    \ olive\ntree, a holistic approach to managing irrigation in cases of reduced\
    \ water availability and\nvariability of soil characteristics [239,240].\nSeveral\
    \ methods based on plant variables have been developed to measure water\nstatus\
    \ and schedule irrigation. Conventional strategies include measuring leaf or stem\n\
    water status, stomatal conductance, or photosynthesis. Automatic methods provide\
    \ con-\ntinuous measurements based on sap ﬂow, trunk diameter, and leaf turgor\
    \ pressure [231].\nAutomated processes are preferred for precision irrigation\
    \ to be implemented with data\ntransmission systems for remote access [231]. Furthermore,\
    \ these methods can be combined\nwith remote imagery to manage differential irrigation\
    \ in areas with different water require-\nments [239,241,242]. Although these\
    \ methods allow for accurate water stress measurement,\nthey have some limitations,\
    \ among which is the inability to be applied over large areas. The\nknowledge\
    \ about the response of the olive tree to water intake and stress and the use\
    \ of\nsensors for monitoring the water status combined with RS images facilitates\
    \ the introduc-\ntion of precision irrigation in olive groves [71,235]. Table\
    \ 6 shows researches in RS in olive\ngrowing dealing with irrigation and water\
    \ management. As highlighted by several au-\nthors [112,243–245], thermal RS has\
    \ an essential role in plant water stress detection. Aerial\nthermal RS imagery\
    \ permits spatially continuous information on plant water status over a\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n17 of 33\nwider area than that obtained from local measurements\
    \ [246,247]. Thermal images enable\nthe detection of water stress conditions of\
    \ a plant. The closure of leaf stomata reduces\ntranspiration and evaporative\
    \ cooling, causing an increase in leaf temperature detectable\nby thermal sensors\
    \ [140,243,248]. In this respect, the work of Sepulcre-Cantó et al. [66]\ninvestigated\
    \ the high-spatial-resolution multi-channel airborne sensor’s capability to detect\n\
    water stress causing changes in olive groves’ canopy temperature. Aerial imagery\
    \ was\ncollected by an airborne hyperspectral scanner (AHS) at 2.5 m spatial resolution,\
    \ acquiring\n80 spectral bands, including ten thermal bands used to derive LST.\
    \ Temperature mea-\nsurements on the ground were made using a hand-held thermometer.\
    \ Water potential\nand stomatal conductance were measured using a Scholander pressure\
    \ chamber and a\nsteady-state leaf porometer, respectively, while ten infrared\
    \ sensors were placed on ten trees\nto measure canopy temperature. The olive trees\
    \ investigated were under three different\nirrigation treatments to obtain three\
    \ different water stress conditions. Results showed\na higher temperature in water-stressed\
    \ trees than in well-watered trees suggesting the\nability of the AHS thermal\
    \ data to detect changes in canopy temperature as a function\nof water stress\
    \ levels. The best results were obtained from measurements taken early in\nthe\
    \ morning due to the slight temperature differences between the soil and the vegetation\n\
    and, consequently, less interference from the soil temperature. The results provided\
    \ valuable\ninsights into managing controlled irrigation methods using RS techniques.\
    \ These results were\nconfirmed by Sepulcre-Cantó et al. [30], who focused on\
    \ determining the potential of thermal\nRS in detecting water stress and how it\
    \ affects yield and fruit quality parameters in olive\nand peach orchards. Images\
    \ taken by AHS allowed for the detection of differences in tree\ncanopy temperature\
    \ associated with irrigation levels. The yield and quality parameters oil\ncontent\
    \ (over dry fruit weight), fruit water content, oil yield, and fresh fruit weight\
    \ were\nconsidered. It was showed a high correlation between water stress and\
    \ some parameters: fruit\nwater content and fresh fruit weight. The link between\
    \ detected temperature and water stress\ncould allow to map potential yield indicators\
    \ and some quality parameters. In addition, the\nmedium resolution of the satellite\
    \ sensor (ASTER) was simulated and tested for detecting\nwater stress by reducing\
    \ the spatial resolution of imagery taken by AHS. The test was per-\nformed through\
    \ a simulation of the spectral characteristics of the ASTER sensor, aggregating\n\
    the pixels of the canopy, soil and projected shadow. The high correlation between\
    \ canopy\nand the air temperature difference (Tc-Ta), measured by AHS, and the\
    \ temperature simulated\nfor the spectral characteristics of the ASTER sensor\
    \ demonstrated the potentialities of using\nmedium-resolution satellite imagery\
    \ for canopies’water stress monitoring.\nASTER’s thermal imagery combined with\
    \ VIs NDVI, greenness index (GI), Modiﬁed\ntriangular vegetation index (MTVI1)\
    \ [50], MTVI2 [50], Modiﬁed chlorophyll absorption in\nreﬂectance index (MCARI1)\
    \ [50], MCARI2 [50], Modiﬁed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(MSAVI) [52], and\
    \ Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) [67] was used by\nSepulcre-Cantó\
    \ et al. [45] for the discrimination between irrigated and rainfed open-tree\n\
    canopies olive groves. A radiative transfer simulation conducted with the DART\
    \ model was\nused to simulate open orchards scene (among which olive trees), evaluating\
    \ the effects of\nthe vegetation cover, crown LAI, and background temperature\
    \ on the canopy temperature\nexploited for discriminating between irrigated and\
    \ rainfed olive groves. The authors\npositively assessed cases where irrigated\
    \ groves had lower canopy temperatures (due to\nincreased canopy conductance)\
    \ and higher NDVI than non-irrigated groves. In particular,\nthermal differences\
    \ of up to 2 K (Kelvin degrees) between irrigated and non-irrigated\ngroves were\
    \ evident in summer while they disappeared in winter satellite imagery.\nIn the\
    \ Mediterranean, where the growing season is hot and dry, an accurate estimation\n\
    of water needs is essential for better managing water resources in agriculture.\
    \ For this rea-\nson, it is important to have a reliable estimate of daily evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) ﬂuxes. Using\nairborne mounting MS and thermal cameras, Cammalleri et al.\
    \ [58] tested an approach\nbased on a modiﬁed version of the standard FAO-56 dual\
    \ crop coefﬁcient procedure to\nestimate ET in an area occupied by olive trees\
    \ similarly to [249]. Estimating orchard water\nrequirements allows for establishing\
    \ irrigation management strategies to increase water\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n\
    18 of 33\nproductivity and optimize the yield and quality of olive trees growing\
    \ in water shortage\nconditions [250]. The calculation of ET is inﬂuenced by the\
    \ intra-orchard spatial variability,\nsuch as canopy size, dependent on both the\
    \ training system and soil water holding capac-\nity [143]. The training system\
    \ and canopy geometries may affect the partitioning of net\nradiation into sensible\
    \ heat ﬂux, soil heat ﬂux, and latent heat ﬂux. Ortega-Farías et al. [251]\nused\
    \ MS and thermal UAV imagery to evaluate energy balance components’ intra-orchard\n\
    spatial variability. A ﬁeld experiment was carried out to develop an RS energy\
    \ balance\n(RSEB) algorithm for estimating olive evapotranspiration in a drip-irrigated\
    \ grove. For\nimplementing the RSEB algorithm, measurements of climatic variables\
    \ (Ta, u, and Rha),\nUAV data, NDVI, and temperature were used. This research\
    \ showed that UAVs alone, or\nif complemented with satellites, can estimate intra-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability of the energy\nbalance components and water requirements.\n\
    Sobrino et al. [252] tested the reliability of thermal RS by analyzing the feasibility\
    \ of\nretrieving LST (in a 4-ha irrigated olive orchard). The second objective\
    \ was the evaluation of\nthe accuracy obtained depending on the number of thermal\
    \ bands used. The aerial surveys\nwere carried out using a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ with 80 bands distributed in four “regions”\nof the electromagnetic spectrum\
    \ (visible, NIR, SWIR, Mid-wave infrared, and Long-wave\ninfrared). The authors\
    \ chose to test three methods for LST retrieval: the single-channel\nmethod, which\
    \ exploits one thermal band; the two-channel method, which combines two\nthermal\
    \ bands; temperature and emissivity separation (TES) method [253], which provides\n\
    surface emissivity in addition to temperature by using MS and thermal data. Infrared\n\
    sensors were placed on poles to monitor the temperature of the canopy as a function\
    \ of a\ngradient in the water status of the olive trees obtained by the drip irrigation\
    \ method. In\nparticular, band 75 (10.07 µm) showed the highest atmospheric transmissivity\
    \ using the\nsingle-channel method, which is the most suitable in this case. The\
    \ combination of the\nbands 75 and 79 (12.35 µm) provided similar results by applying\
    \ the two-channel method.\nSome researches [63,84,88,254] stood apart from the\
    \ others on water stress and con-\ncerns with the management of water resources\
    \ in olive groves in arid areas (North African\ncountries). Castelli et al.’s\
    \ work [254] deals with the effect of jessour, traditional water\nharvesting check\
    \ dams, on olive growing in Tunisia. Time series of Normalized Difference\nInfrared\
    \ Index NDII [255] derived from Landsat 7 were retrieved from Google Earth Engine\n\
    imagery for analyzing olive trees’ water conditions over a period ranging from\
    \ 1999 to 2017.\nUsing a methodology that included ground-based soil moisture\
    \ measurements, the authors\nconﬁrmed the usefulness of NDII in representing the\
    \ state of soil moisture in dry soil\nconditions, as shown by Sriwongsitanon et\
    \ al. [256]. In addition, the monitoring showed\nthat jessour sites reduce olive\
    \ trees’ water stress compared with non-jessour sites. Keﬁ\net al. [84] detected\
    \ irrigated and non-irrigated (rainfed) olive-growing farms in Tunisia\nusing\
    \ Landsat 8 imagery and analyzing temporal changes exploiting NDVI, RVI, and\n\
    LST. The results showed the usefulness of NDVI and LST data in identifying irrigated\n\
    olive-growing farms characterized in summer by higher vegetation index values\
    \ and lower\ntemperatures. Hoedjes et al. [88] aimed to calculate daily evapotranspiration\
    \ using satellite\nimagery (ASTER) to improve irrigation water management at the\
    \ ﬁeld scale of an irrigated\nolive grove in Morocco. Kharrou et al. [63] evaluated\
    \ an RS-based approach to estimate\nthe temporal and spatial distribution of crop\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation water\nrequirements over irrigated areas\
    \ in Morocco. The approach is based on the daily step\nFAO-56 Soil Water Balance\
    \ model, which was combined with a time series (2002–2003\nand 2008–2009) of basal\
    \ crop coefﬁcients and the fractional vegetation cover derived from\nLandsat TM\
    \ satellite NDVI imagery. The model was calibrated and validated at a plot\nscale\
    \ using ET measured by eddy-covariance systems in wheat ﬁelds and olive groves.\
    \ The\nmodel showed to be able to provide reasonable estimates of ET both for\
    \ wheat and olive.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n19 of 33\nTable 6. References\

    \ and temporal resolution of satellite thermal images makes\nthem unsuitable for\
    \ the estimation of water requirements of the olive tree in some pheno-\nlogical\
    \ phases [143]. In the last decade, the ﬁrst studies based on UAVs mounting thermal\n\
    (and MS or hyperspectral) cameras for applications in agriculture can be found.\
    \ Crop irri-\ngation management became a crucial application of UAV technologies\
    \ in PA [119]. UAVs,\nequipped with several sensors, among which are thermal,\
    \ can detect possible deﬁciencies in\nthe irrigation of different sites. These\
    \ data can be processed through photogrammetry tech-\nniques to produce a high-resolution\
    \ vegetation map highlighting the water-stressed areas.\nThe detection of water\
    \ stress was studied in different tree species, including the olive tree,\ntogether\
    \ with the estimation of orchards’ water requirements [48,140,141,143,232,257,258].\n\
    To our knowledge, a couple of researches on olive trees [139,140] have used UAV\
    \ thermal\nimages exploiting the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). CWSI [246] is\
    \ a temperature-based\nindex that can assume values between 0 and 1 and is directly\
    \ proportional to the water\nstress level of many species of interest in agriculture.\
    \ In several studies, CWSI was shown\nto have good correlations with leaf water\
    \ potential (ΨL) [229,259,260]. Berni et al. [140]\nused thermal imagery (taken\
    \ by UAV and airborne) to calculate and map the tree canopy\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 5430\n20 of 33\nconductance and the CWSI in a heterogeneous olive orchard\
    \ by combining the energy\nbalance equations and the theoretical formulation of\
    \ CWSI.\nBellvert et al. [139] compared CWSI derived from thermal UAV imagery\
    \ and leaf\nwater potential (ΨL) measured using a Scholander pressure chamber\
    \ in olive trees. The\nlinear relationships between CWSI and ΨL allowed for the\
    \ remote estimation of ΨL and\nthe detection of spatial variability of plant water\
    \ status in an olive orchard. Similarly,\nEgea et al. [141] proved the usefulness\
    \ of the CWSI, both obtained by thermal UAV imagery\nand ﬁeld measurements, for\
    \ monitoring water stress in a super-intensive olive grove by\nevaluating relationships\
    \ between CWSI and other water stress indicators, such as stomatal\nconductance,\
    \ stem water potential, and leaf transpiration rate.\nScholander pressure chamber\
    \ can provide accurate knowledge of olive water sta-\ntus [261] but is impractical\
    \ due to the large number of measurements required [262]. The\nsame applies to\
    \ the calculation of stomatal conductance [263]. Taking into account the\nneed,\
    \ in the framework of PA, to overcome these limitations, Poblete-Echeverría et\
    \ al. [257]\nevaluated the accuracy of water stress detection performed using\
    \ aerial and terrestrial\ninfrared thermography in a vineyard and in an olive\
    \ grove. Field measurements included\ncalculating Ψstem on several twigs while\
    \ canopy temperature was measured using a hand-\nheld thermal camera (lateral\
    \ imagery) and UAV for nadir-view thermal imagery. Results\nshowed that the difference\
    \ between the canopy’s temperature and air temperature (Tc–Ta)\nwas related to\
    \ differences in water potential for different irrigation treatments when the\n\
    olive was under stress.\nRiveros-Burgos et al. [143] used UAV thermal imagery\
    \ and meteorological data to\nestimate the intra-orchard spatial variability in\
    \ olive water requirements in super-intensive\ndrip-irrigated orchards. For this\
    \ purpose, the authors used the clumped model of Brenner\nand Incoll [264], which\
    \ is considered suitable for producing maps to estimate the intra-\norchard spatial\
    \ variability in the presence of heterogeneous canopies (typical of intensive\n\
    and super-intensive groves), which inﬂuences the partitioning of ET into tree\
    \ transpiration\nand soil surface evaporation.\nUsing sensors other than thermal\
    \ ones allows the discrimination of management\nzones, irrigation inhomogeneities,\
    \ and irrigation methods based on the olive tree’s spectral\nresponse, as shown\
    \ in [48,60,232]. Gertsis et al. [60] used NDVI, obtained from RS ground-\nlevel\
    \ measurements, and UAV to identify different areas in crops grown and to delineate\n\
    Management Zones in an olive orchard in Greece. Jorge et al. [48] compared several\n\
    VIs (NDVI, NDRE, Green Normalized Vegetation Index GNDVI [46], and Soil Adjusted\n\
    Vegetation Index SAVI [70]) using MS UAV imagery for detecting inhomogeneities\
    \ in\nirrigated vineyards and olive groves. According to their results, the NDRE\
    \ (Normalized\nDifference Red Edge Index) [265] highlighted irrigation irregularities\
    \ more effectively.\nSantos-Rufo et al. [232] used UAV hyperspectral data to compare\
    \ the performance of some\nwavelength selection methods based on Partial Least\
    \ Square (PLS) regression [266,267]\nto discriminate two systems of irrigation\
    \ used in olive groves: subsurface drip irrigation\nand surface drip irrigation.\
    \ As the spectral response of the olive trees is sensitive to the\nirrigation\
    \ technique used, the authors were able to map the irrigated areas.\n7. Final\
    \ Remarks and Conclusions\nThis review covered the past, from the 2000s onwards,\
    \ and the most recent applications\nof aerial RS technology in olive growing.\
    \ To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst\nto focus on this speciﬁc topic.\
    \ Starting synthesis on RS platforms and sensors, mainly\nsatellites and UAVs\
    \ used in research, is followed by the discussion of several topics by\nreviewing\
    \ research conducted over the twenty years analyzed, from the protection of the\n\
    olive-growing landscape from erosion and pollution.\nConcerning the platforms\
    \ used, overall, the use of satellite data is equivalent to that of\nUAV images,\
    \ with a prevalence of one of them according to the speciﬁc topic and objectives\n\
    in olive growing. Considering the several factors to consider when comparing platforms\n\
    and sensors, both technical (spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions, areal\
    \ coverage,\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n21 of 33\ntargeted features) and economic\
    \ (UAV equipment vs. satellite images costs), it is complex\nto evaluate and suggest\
    \ what would be the best approach to use in a survey [268]. Indeed,\nin the early\
    \ 2000s, most of the research involved satellite and aircraft imagery, used for\n\
    mapping and inventorying olive groves, as it was still early for the spread of\
    \ UAVs and\ntheir use in agriculture [269].\nIn light of the researches reviewed,\
    \ the identiﬁcation of olive groves and OOMW\nmanagement monitoring concerned\
    \ the predominant use of satellite imagery over aircraft\nand UAVs. One of the\
    \ main advantages of satellite imagery is the possibility of covering\nlarge areas.\
    \ In particular, providing data over large areas with spatial resolutions ranging\n\
    from 30 m of Landsat to less than 4 m using IKONOS and Quickbird allowed for achiev-\n\
    ing remarkable results in the topics addressed by the research in the ﬁrst decade\
    \ of 2000.\nMoreover, Landsat imagery remains a reliable data source for studying\
    \ land-use changes\nbecause of its relatively high spatial resolution and long-term\
    \ archives, now reaching ﬁfty\nyears (considering the ﬁrst images since 1972).\
    \ However, even though signiﬁcant progress\nhas been made in developing high-resolution\
    \ satellite sensors since 1999, some challenges\nremain. Many satellites capable\
    \ of providing high-resolution images close to or below one\nmeter belong to commercial\
    \ companies, which means costs for a farm to obtain and reuse\nimages. To date,\
    \ the highest spatial resolution images free of charge are those provided\nby\
    \ the Sentinel satellites. In addition, although many satellites provide images\
    \ of an area\nwith a temporal resolution of between one and ﬁve days, it is necessary\
    \ to consider the\nlocal weather conditions that may prevent obtaining long periods\
    \ of continuous images of\nacceptable quality [270]. Therefore, integrating images\
    \ from various satellites to create high-\nquality, dense time-series data becomes\
    \ a critical task for studies requiring observations\nwith high frequency and\
    \ high spatial resolution [271]. Because multiple satellite sensors are\navailable,\
    \ potential customers can order images provided by more than one satellite sensor,\n\
    increasing the possibility of having images rapidly despite the difﬁculties posed\
    \ by the\ncloudiness and the different revisit frequencies of a speciﬁc area.\
    \ The introduction of new,\nrelatively recent platforms, including nano-satellites,\
    \ and mounting sensors providing high\nor ultra-high resolution images, less than\
    \ 3 m and 1 m, respectively, have made satellites\nmore competitive with UAVs\
    \ in PA applications [15]. However, to our knowledge, only\nthree papers dealing\
    \ with olive groves used nanosatellite images such as Cubesats from\nPlanetScope\
    \ [41,98,99]. This is despite the affordable price of the images compared to satel-\n\
    lites with similar or higher resolution, such as Pleiades and WorldView [272].\
    \ In the topics\nof olive grove identiﬁcation and management of OOMW, the preponderant\
    \ role of satellites\nin achieving the objectives and in reducing the complexity\
    \ of environmental monitoring\ncan be observed even in those without both high\
    \ spatial and temporal resolution. Imagery\nfrom satellites capable of “covering\
    \ wide areas” can be used primarily at the territorial\nlevel, and in olive growing,\
    \ for monitoring large olive groves with “traditional” planting\ndistances such\
    \ that individual canopies can be distinguished by public administrations and\n\
    control bodies [33]. To better exploit the wide variety of publicly available\
    \ satellite data and\nproduce high temporal and spatial resolution data, several\
    \ data fusion approaches have\nbeen proposed that can combine high/medium spatial\
    \ resolution data with high temporal\nresolution data [271]. Satellites have difﬁculty\
    \ producing images that have both high spatial\nand temporal resolution because\
    \ of the tradeoff between scan width and pixel size [273].\nIn this regard, a\
    \ novelty is constituted by a constellation of satellites soon to be launched\n\
    called WorldView Legion, which will consist of six satellites capable of providing\
    \ images\nat a resolution of less than 30 cm and with high frequency (up to 15\
    \ times per day) on the\nareas most in demand (www.maxar.com, last access 3 October\
    \ 2022). Images from aircraft,\nwhich present better quality than satellite images,\
    \ can also be used in PA [114]. Like the\nother platforms, the limitations dictated\
    \ by weather conditions and, concerning the areas\ncovered, by the presence or\
    \ absence of companies that provide RS imagery services remain,\nin addition to\
    \ the costs not accessible to all users [89,119]. It is desirable that the use\
    \ of RS\nplatforms and sensors in agriculture is not only the prerogative of research\
    \ institutions but\nthat it continues the trend of increasing user-friendliness\
    \ of these technologies for all types\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5430\n22 of 33\n\
    of users. Motivating and developing the skills of a wide variety of farmers may\
    \ be the main\nchallenge toward real-world applications of RS platforms in agriculture.\
    \ However, proper\nuse of the technologies requires increasing farmer conﬁdence\
    \ and knowledge even when\nusing a more readily available platform such as the\
    \ UAV. Training to implement the entire\nworkﬂow, including the proper use of\
    \ sensors, is critical in the instrumentation’s use and\nrepair and maintenance\
    \ aspects [148]. Cheaper, consumer-grade optical (RGB) sensors are\nnot always\
    \ suitable for agricultural applications. NIR-equipped MS sensors are needed\n\
    for calculating many VIs, just as thermal cameras are critical in water stress\
    \ monitoring.\nFurthermore, using more complex sensors, such as LiDAR and hyperspectral\
    \ cameras,\noften requires a higher load capacity from the UAV and a consequent\
    \ higher expense in\npurchasing the RS platform. Beyond a desirable and probable\
    \ lowering of the weight and\ncost of UAVs and sensors in the future, the considerations\
    \ made so far are essential to\nunderstanding the current user base that can afford\
    \ this technology. Outside the scope\nof research, the farms with greater economic\
    \ resources and extensions are certainly more\nfacilitated and interested in the\
    \ purchase of UAV and its use for crop monitoring (including\nequipment cost and\
    \ data processing through a speciﬁc software). In addition, the training\nrequired\
    \ to implement the entire workﬂow in the data acquisition and processing phases\n\
    is of paramount importance. Critical steps that can be improved, mainly on automation,\n\
    include preparing the optimal ﬂight plan, conﬁguring and calibrating sensors before\
    \ and\nduring ﬂight, in the case of UAV data, and reducing the time required for\
    \ data processing.\nFrom this, it follows that using RS technologies in agriculture\
    \ demands both in phases of\nacquisition and processing the presence of expert\
    \ and qualiﬁed experts with aggravation\nof expense for the company. Unlike satellites\
    \ whose applications are generally associated\nwith a processing chain that ensures\
    \ ﬁnal data quality, images from UAVs require several\nsometimes complex steps\
    \ to be retrieved and used after surveying [274].\nFor this reason, adopting UAV\
    \ technologies by individual farmers with few and small\nagricultural ﬁelds is\
    \ less common [119]. It is desirable that continued development of\nsensor technologies,\
    \ lower costs, and input cost savings will bring beneﬁts that will make it\neasier\
    \ to overcome this obstacle in the future. So far, if compared to satellites,\
    \ UAVs have\nbeen shown to provide signiﬁcantly better spatial resolution imagery\
    \ and greater ﬂexibility\nin selecting the appropriate spatio-temporal resolution\
    \ [275]. Compared to aircraft, UAVs\ncan ﬂy at lower altitudes and, in the case\
    \ of monitoring performed on tree species, ﬂy closer\nto tree tops and provide\
    \ a very detailed view of the dynamics of the vegetation [276]. The\napplication\
    \ of UAVs in aerial photogrammetry is accepted as a reliable and accurate remote\n\
    sensing method for environmental protection and mapping vegetation species, including\n\
    the olive tree.\nThe preservation of olive groves as an element of Mediterranean\
    \ identity both in\nlandscaping and as a strategic economic resource in agriculture\
    \ depends on sustainable\nenvironmental management based on improving the competitiveness\
    \ of the agricultural\nsector and technological progress in compliance with the\
    \ guidelines of PA [97,277,278].\nLandscapes should be regarded as a land-use\
    \ system at the center of human-nature re-\nlations that to be managed efﬁciently\
    \ to preserve and restore ecosystem services while\ncontributing to sustainable\
    \ solutions, including the challenge of food security [279,280].\nCharacterization\
    \ of agricultural systems with a focus on agricultural intensiﬁcation is\nuseful\
    \ for understanding the sustainability of agricultural lands. In this framework,\
    \ the\ncontribution of RS is important, as shown in the applications seen in landscape\
    \ monitoring\nand soil defense, olive grove monitoring, and OOMW management. Coupled\
    \ with the\nchallenges facing olive growing and agriculture, more generally in\
    \ terms of production,\nare those related to climate change, the most obvious\
    \ consequences of which include a\nchanging distribution of rainfall and an increasing\
    \ number of extreme weather events,\nand increased environmental pressures represented\
    \ by the risks of overexploitation of\ngroundwater resources, degradation of water\
    \ and soil quality [77,223]. Among the uses\nof RS, beyond the type of platform\
    \ employed, the synthesis between the need to meet the\nneeds of consumers and\
    \ producers in terms of economic as well, while at the same time\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 5430\n23 of 33\npreserving the environment and its resources is represented\
    \ by its use in water resource\nmanagement. RS has been shown both to be able\
    \ to contribute to the defense of water bod-\nies from wastewater pollution risk\
    \ (citation) and, through the determination of irrigation\ninhomogeneities, spatial\
    \ variability within the orchard, evapotranspiration, etc., to be able to\ngive\
    \ guidance for irrigation optimization in the balance between yield, product quality,\
    \ and\nequitable consumption of water. In pursuit of these goals, an already well-established\
    \ use of\nRS in olive crop research becomes evident and equally desirable on farms,\
    \ in line with the key\nprinciples of PA, i.e., “ . . . support management decisions\
    \ according to estimated variability\nfor improved resource use efficiency, productivity,\
    \ quality, profitability and sustainability of\nagricultural production” and the\
    \ present and future needs of the olive sector [281].\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Abstract This paper presents the design of a (i) soil sensing and monitoring wireless
    sensor network (S2M-WSN) that can sense and monitor farmland with distributed
    and networked motes equipped with multiple soil sensors and (ii) a prototype decision
    support system (DSS) that analyses the soil data received from S2M-WSN using statistical
    methods, stored rules and knowledge base (KB) and auto-transmits alerts on the
    mobile phones of end-users. Both S2M-WSN and the DSS are integrated through (iii)
    predefined data frame format and interface protocol. The developed system has
    been deployed both in the laboratory and real crop conditions for verification,
    validation and performance evaluation. The system is evaluated by considering
    various performance metrics such as ambiguities associated with data, data packet
    delivery rates, support delivery performance ratio, system response time, and
    resultant plant growth. The developed system empowers the end users with assistance
    in on-field decision making through relevant advisories and alerts at right time
    on their mobile phones. The authors believe that the developed system would definitely
    bridge the information gap between end-users and domain experts for sustainable
    growth of agriculture. Similar content being viewed by others Smart controlled

    Open access 11 March 2024 1 Introduction Precision farming (PF) is a farm management
    concept that makes the intensive use of advance technologies and tools [1] to
    enhance crop production with reduced environmental risks and conserved natural
    resources [2]. This concept has been widely utilized to make farming more effective
    and informative by enabling enhanced decision making about what to grow and when,
    what is right time and right proportion of irrigation and fertilization etc. It
    also helps the farmers in evaluating the exact requirements of farmland to achieve
    optimal production and sustainable agricultural growth [3]. Right and relevant
    information about farmland or cultivated soil is the factual basis and the key
    driver of sustainable growth of agriculture. Since soil ecosystem is a critical
    resource in agriculture production system hence its timely assessment and accurate
    evaluation is very much essential for healthy plant growth and optimal crop yields
    [4]. The soil properties [5] such as soil temperature, soil moisture content (SMC),
    and pH along with on-farm environmental conditions like air temperature, and sunlight,
    if not monitored and managed properly, can have the adverse effects on crop yields.
    Usually, soil temperature, SMC and pH are monitored and analyzed to predict precision
    irrigation and fertilization needs whereas soil temperature, SMC and electrical
    conductivity (EC) are utilized to predict plant growth and corresponding crop
    yields [6, 7]. The inherent heterogeneity of chemical and physical properties
    of soil makes it a complex ecosystem. Due to its complexity, its evaluation, assessment
    and effective management is fundamentally a challenge for researchers’/soil scientists.
    The constituent elements of soil testing and evaluation process such as soil sample
    collection, transporting the same to a laboratory for chemical analysis, and interpretive
    mapping is tedious, time-consuming and laborious task [8]. Furthermore, inadequate
    capacity of soil testing labs (STLs) and soil technicians to entertain large-scale
    soil analysis, dearth of soil specific decision support systems (DSS) and delayed
    advisories/reports from experts have even worsened the situation [9]. Lack of
    information communication technology (ICT) means for conveying the right agro-technical
    inputs from agro experts to end users at right time is one of the major causes
    that widen the gap between end users and experts at STLs. In their endeavor to
    gain maximum profit, the farmers exploit their farmland the way they want without
    knowing its adverse effects on soil fertility and environmental risks. It is also
    important to mention that the real reason for soil fertility degradation is not
    farmers’ but it is the unavailability of relevant and timely information during
    the entire cropping cycle. The authors also believe that the development of proposed
    integrated WSN-DSS system would definitely bridge the information gap between
    the experts and end users. The spatiotemporal study of farmland [10, 11] requires
    continuous sensing and monitoring which is very hard to realize in remote, harsh
    farming conditions. But the advances and intensive research in WSN technology
    has shown its potential in a wide variety of agricultural applications [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]
    such as precision irrigation, integrated pest management (IPM) and many more.
    Round the clock monitoring of farmland and underlying on-farm environmental conditions
    [30] will definitely ensure optimum yields and reduced potential production risks
    [31]. The WSNs consists of wirelessly networked small sized, low cost, low power,
    autonomous, and cooperating devices known as motes [32, 33]. Nowadays, the motes
    are generally equipped with a variety of application-specific sensors from simple
    e.g. temperature, humidity, light, moisture to complex sensors such as global
    positioning system (GPS), and video camera [34] and so on. These networked motes
    when deployed unattended at remotely located farms, connect the agricultural environment
    wirelessly with the computational world by providing accurate, and up to-date
    information about a number of agricultural entities in the farm environment. In
    recent times, the technological revolution in WSN technology has raised its potential
    to sense, monitor, and collect farmland information to many folds but the necessity
    to accelerate the processing of information into decisions has also increased
    at the same rate [35]. The value of information increases when data collection,
    processing, analysis and management actions are fully integrated [36]. The characteristic
    of futuristic PF systems would be real-time conversion of collected and monitored
    information into decisions. The futuristic PF systems would consist of sensor
    based monitoring systems that collect, preprocess and communicate the formatted
    farm information to remotely located data center via state of art wireless communication
    technologies where the captured and stored information is analyzed using data
    analytics before mapping into decisions. The futuristic systems would provide
    an easy to handle control to operators/managers for decision override or confirmation
    using their own experience/domain knowledge. In short, the futuristic PF systems
    would be a single package for integrated and automated sensing, processing and
    delivery of information into decisions in form of expert knowledge driven alerts
    and advisories to stakeholders at right time. To meet the futuristic PF needs,
    this paper presents the design and development of an integrated S2M-WSN-DSS system
    to assist the farmers in decision making on crop specific farmland assessment.
    The design process is divided into phases as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Design
    and development phases Full size table The paper is divided into nine sections
    where Sect. 2 discusses the research objectives and expected outcome. Section

    implementation. The Sect. 6 discusses handling uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness
    in real time data from WSN. The Sect. 7 describes system validation mythology
    and performance evaluation metrics. The discussion on the performance of the proposed
    integrated system based on pre-defined performance metrics and deployment in real
    crop conditions is presented in Sect. 8. The section also covers the results obtained
    during the entire verification and validation phase. In last Sect. 9 gives concludes
    the paper with future scope of work. 2 Research objectives and expected outcome
    The utmost goal of this research work is to design, develop and deploy a prototype
    integrated S2M-WSN-DSS for farmland assessment and assistance/support to decision
    makers’ in on field decision making via right and timely advisories/alerts. The
    objectives and expected outcome of the research work is given in following subsections.
    2.1 Research objectives (a) Designing WSN for sensing the farmland and on-farm
    environmental conditions in the entire cropping cycle. (b) Designing an optimal
    data frame format and interface protocol for seamless data integration of WSN
    with DSS. (c) Utilization of statistical mechanisms for data analysis considering
    predefined rules and user driven knowledge base. (d) Designing methodology for

    time. (c) Communicate timely alerts/advisories on mobile phones. 3 System overview
    and architecture Figure 1 depicts the overall architecture of integrated S2M-WSN-DSS
    system for farmland monitoring and assessment. Fig. 1 Integrated S2M-WSN and DSS
    system for farmland assessment Full size image The first component of proposed
    integrated system consists of a S2M-WSN. The S2M-WSN is deployed in form of clusters
    where each cluster consists of 05 motes and each mote is equipped with 05 sensors
    having 03 soil sensors [pH, soil moisture content (SMC), soil temperature] and
    02 environmental sensors (air temperature, sun light). In the S2M-WSN, the networked
    and distributed motes operates together to sense, monitor, collect, and transmit,
    valid and preprocessed soil information to their respective cluster head (CH)
    at an interval of 15 min over ZigBee technology. The CHs further reports the aggregated
    information to its reporting base-station (BS) using ZigBee technology. BS receives
    and processes the data packets from its cluster heads (CHs) and converts the preprocessed
    information into the predefined data frame format before communicating it to remotely
    located DSS over GSM technology. In smaller deployments, CHs can play the role
    of BS and can transmit the formatted data frames to data analytic center. The
    second component of proposed integrated system is a data-driven prototype DSS
    with inbuilt alerts and advisory features. The DSS seamlessly integrates with
    the BS of S2M-WSN through GSM technology via a serially connected GSM module (SIM
    900). The inbuilt user and configuration management module on web based graphical
    user interface (GUI) of prototype DSS empowers the authentic and registered user
    to configure the serial port details (port number, baud rate, parity, stop bit
    and data bits) to ensure the readiness of DSS application to receive any data
    on the serial port. The application after initialization, exchanges its health
    with BS of S2M-WSN with ‘ALIVE’ data packet which is acknowledged by BS application
    with ‘ACK’. On reception of ‘ACK’ the DSS application forwards a data request
    (REQ) packet at a pre-defined periodicity to BS which in response gives the data
    packet (DATA) to DSS. The received data packet is first authenticated using unique
    identification no assigned to S2M-WSN during configuration, followed by validation,
    and cleaning by the data preprocessing routine of DSS before storing the data
    attributes and values into a central database (DB). The data analytic engine (DAE)
    inbuilt in the DSS analyzes the data retrieved from the database using statistical
    techniques and knowledge stored in the knowledge base (KB). During analysis, the
    normalized value of each parameter is compared with the threshold pre-stored in
    KB. The advisories/feedbacks are generated by DSS based on the comparison of data
    analysis results. The feedback/alerts/advisories generated by prototype DSS are
    communicated on the registered mobile phones of the end users/farmers via existing
    cellular network. 4 System design and development The proposed integrated system
    is designed by considering the farmland management problems in a holistic manner
    so that overall management solutions are provided through (a) automation in data
    sensing, collection and pre-processing for integration; (b) utilization of new
    generation statistical models that are validated and best fit solution for given
    problem [37]; (c) providing a user-friendly interface and relevant and right information
    in easy-to-understand information; (d) to enable continuous updating and flexible
    access and; (e) providing information from a remote source to the end-user in
    form of alerts and advisories. The proposed system is designed not to replace
    the decision maker but assisting decision-making. It is designed, developed and
    tested by taking feedback from potential users. The next sub-section shall discuss
    the process adopted for design and development of the proposed system. An incremental
    or agile development model has been adopted for complete system software development
    [38]. This model has been adopted in the development process as it involves continuous
    interaction between users, developers, domain experts and testers in the entire
    development process. Another reason for its adoption is the consideration of the
    requirement of end-user participation in development process. In this model, the
    software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. The results in small incremental
    releases with each release building on previous functionality. Each release is
    thoroughly tested to ensure software quality. The only constraint of this approach
    i.e. maintenance of documentation is also overcome by keeping all the documentation
    intact and available during each phase of design and development. The following
    Fig. 2 self-explains the development model utilized in proposed system development.
    Fig. 2 S2M-WSN-DSS system-software development model Full size image 4.1 Designing
    S2M-WSN 4.1.1 Selection of soil sensors While designing soil sensing mote, selection
    of soil sensors is a tedious and time consuming task as it involves different
    quality metrics such as sensitivity, accuracy, stability, sensing range, durability
    and cost. In order to meet the requirement of current research work, various soil
    sensors (Fig. 3) such as soil temperature probe (PT100), soil moisture probe (VH400),
    soil pH electrode (gel filled electrode-PH-BTA), electrical conductivity (EC)
    using MT-114, air temperature integrated circuit (IC) (LM35) and light sensor
    (GL55 series LDR) were identified and selected to measure soil temperature, moisture,
    pH, air temperature and on-farm sunlight respectively. The detailed specifications
    of these sensors are given in Table 2. Fig. 3 Soil sensors deployed in real conditions

    Full size table 4.1.2 Designing configurable wireless sensor node cum cluster
    head (CH) A multi-functional, multi communication-interface and multi-application
    (M3SS) mote [44] was utilized to form the ZigBee/GSM based S2M-WSN for the soil
    property sensing and monitoring. The M3SS mote senses the multiple soil parameters
    of farmland simultaneously, filters the erroneous data, develops formatted data
    frame and routes the formatted information to networked M3SS motes at higher echelons
    configured as either CHs or BS. Figure 4 displays the building blocks of the M3SS
    mote. Fig. 4 ZigBee based wireless soil sensing (M3SS) mote Full size image The
    architecture of M3SS node comprises of five basic modules including data acquisition
    unit (DAU), data processing unit (DPU), power management module, real-time clock
    (RTC) module and wireless communication module that supports Bluetooth/ZigBee
    and GSM technologies. To provide excitations to all the sensors, the sensors need
    to be interfaced with DAU of M3SS. The DAU circuit and its PCB have been designed
    with design spark tool [45]. The sensors on excitation give low-level analog output
    which needs further amplification and calibration. In order to design the amplification
    circuitry, low noise amplifier IC TL072 has been utilized. The amplified output
    is transmitted to the inbuilt analog to digital converters (ADC) of DPU. The DPU
    of M3SS is designed with low cost, low power, small size mbed NXP LPC11U24 microcontroller
    which is especially designed for prototyping low cost and low power applications.
    The microcontroller is built with a 32-bit ARM 7 Cortex-M0 core running at 48
    MHz with 32 KB FLASH, 8 KB RAM and various external interfaces USB, SPI, I2C,
    ADC, and other I/O interfaces. This microcontroller plays a vital role as it provides
    computing power for local decision making and data aggregation, energy management
    through sleep/awake modes etc. [46]. Figure 5 depicts the designed M3SS mote utilized
    in development of S2M-WSN. Fig. 5 Designed ZigBee based wireless soil sensing
    node Full size image Due to its reliability connectivity over short distances,
    ZigBee wireless technology has been chosen for intra-network data routing in S2M-WSN.
    Furthermore, the configurable feature of this technology allows it to work in
    three different device configurations in the network such as coordinator, router,
    and end device. The ZigBee can automatically initiate, maintain and manage the
    information in the network when configured as coordinator device. It links the
    network devices together by transmitting the data and associating with other routers
    and end-devices when acts as a router device. The end device nodes can only send
    and receive the data. The coordinator, router, and end devices are similar in
    hardware but different in terms of inbuilt embedded software. Each function can
    be realized through the software configuration inbuilt in M3SS node. The M3SS
    node can also be configured as CH whose role is to receive and aggregates the
    data frames from associated networked sensor nodes reporting to it and routes
    the aggregated data frames to BS. In S2M-WSN, the CH is a solar-powered M3SS mote
    in which ZigBee is configured as a router. The CH acts as a data integrator cum
    router between sensors and BS. The inbuilt routine in CH receives the data from
    sensing nodes, cleans and validates it, assigns a unique number to the data packet
    and routes the formatted data packet to next level via ZigBee interface. This
    unique number signifies the single intermediate data packet from multiple sensing
    nodes under it. 4.1.3 Designing base station (BS) node The role of base station
    (BS) node is to receive the data from multiple CHs. The BS acts as a gateway to
    S2M-WSN. It aggregates the acquired data from CHs using aggregation algorithms,
    formats in a predefined data frame format and transmits it to distantly located
    DSS over GSM technology. It also integrates S2M-WSN with external system such
    as data analysis nodes, web servers or intelligent information systems such as
    intelligent DSSs. Figure 6 displays the components of base station (BS) node.
    Fig. 6 Building blocks of ZigBee based base station node Full size image The Fig.
    7 depicts the designed BS. The BS also acts as a network manager which manages
    the complete network based on the commands sent by the DSS. The inbuilt aggregation
    algorithm is based on averaging the time stamped values of captured data. The
    BS transmits the data based on PUSH approach where the aggregated data is communicated
    to DSS as a response of request received from the DSS itself. The data request
    can be either automated and periodic or manual request initiated by data analyst
    or expert. Fig. 7 Designed and deployed ZigBee-GSM based base station Full size
    image The BS is connected with a host computer or data analysis center or automated
    DSS through global system for mobile (GSM) module by serial RS-232 interface to
    communicate with a remotely located data analytics/decision support system. The
    base station was implemented by using raspberry pi system on chip (SoC) and its
    02 USB ports have been used to connect GSM and ZigBee modules to interact with
    CHs of S2M-WSN and DSS. It also acts as a data logger where a light weight MySQL
    database is designed and developed for data logging. 4.1.4 Power supply unit To
    understand the power requirement of the designed soil sensing node, lab experiments
    were conducted to measure the power consumption using sample data packet transmission
    at a predefined rate which is taken as one data packet/15 min an hour. Each node’s
    power consumption and duration of operation with error-free/lossless transmission
    and reception of data packets was measured in the laboratory environment. A 12
    V 6.5 Ah lead-acid heavy-duty battery is selected after analyzing power requirements
    considering (a) guaranteed and prolonged day/night (24 × 7) operation of WSN and
    (b) to reserve power for more nodes in case of network expansion. A 50 W/cm2 rating
    solar panel was selected to provide enough peak voltage to the 12 V battery during
    charging. The various components of the node were supported through a 3.3 V 1
    A regulator. 4.1.5 Network topology in S2M-WSN In order to meet the energy needs
    in application-specific environments, the WSNs have to be deployed in the certain
    network topology. The different network properties such as lifetime, throughput,
    and end to end delay are majorly affected by network topology. In this research
    work, tree topology has been used where the network utilizes a central hub that
    is also termed as base-station or coordinator node to act as a root node. A two-hop
    networking cluster with star-topology allows direct communication between the
    central node and each sensor node inside one cluster without complex routing and
    routing table maintenance. This type of topology makes the network more flexible
    and scalable as more number of sensor nodes or motes can be added into one cluster
    without reconstructing the routing table, any other new cluster can be deployed
    adjacent to others without disturbing the operation of other clusters. Another
    advantage is robustness of network as failure of any node won’t affect the operation
    of whole network. In the hieratical structure, the relay node is one level below
    from the root node. This lower level forms a star network where the sensing nodes
    reports to the relay node. The tree network can be considered a hybrid of both
    the star and peer to peer networking topologies as shown in Fig. 9. The data path
    in the network may be single hop or multi hop through which the sensed data is
    forwarded to its parent node. It is important to find an optimal shortest path
    tree with maximum lifetime and shorter delay but slightly high time complexity.
    This topology is more suitable for distributed implementation. As the target application
    is agricultural soil sensing and monitoring through a distributed WSN that is
    why this topology is chosen. Establishment of reliable communication link is important
    aspect of this topology as if there is a link break in the network path on the
    active route then communication also breaks. As per the Fig. 8, SN and SK are
    the Nth and Kth set of sensing motes which gives the data packets P i and P k
    respectively from ith and kth CHs that takes the average of each sensed value,
    forms a new preprocessed packet P i and P k respectively with unique data packet
    number. Fig. 8 Network topology in S2M-WSN Full size image 4.2 Prototype DSS overview
    and architecture The various components and architecture of DSS are shown in Fig.
    9. The main components of DSS are (1) External system interface (ESI), (2) Human
    computer interface (HCI), (3) Data processing engine (DPE), (4) Data base (DB),
    (5) Knowledge base (KB) and (6) Decision analytics & advisory engine (DA2E). Fig.
    9 DSS components and architecture Full size image 4.3 Design of prototype DSS
    for farmland assessment Designing DSS is a complex process that includes the usage
    of adequate mechanisms to model the decision process. The design and development
    of a DSS basically comprises of following. 4.3.1 Requirement capturing and objective
    identification The requirements are captured by interaction with users to understand
    their needs and expectations. The objectives of designing the proposed system
    are identified based on the interaction with the end-users who are farmers’ in
    this case. The major requirements raised by them are: (i) Lack of understanding
    of soil ecosystem of their farmland. (ii) Shortage of automated means for farmland
    assessment. (iii) Lack of means for real-time quantification of spatial and temporal
    variability of soil during cropping cycle. (iv) No means of direct feedback/response
    between farmers and experts. (v) Insufficient, unreliable and delayed response.
    (vi) Limited usage of ICT in decision making. After requirement gathering, requirement
    when analyzed, it is concluded it is not farmers’ who are generally made responsible
    for loss of fertility and lower yields and for soil degradation, it is lack of
    usage of ICT and dearth of DSSs that support decision making for soil quality
    assessment. 4.3.2 Identification of functional and interface requirements In this
    step, the functional and interface requirements are studied and identified. First
    the interfaces were analyzed. The proposed DSS will have the following interfaces:
    (i) External agency and human interfaces. The external interfaces have been identified
    to cater all the design requirements of the proposed DSS. External agencies such
    as agriculture research institutes/soil evaluation and mapping centers’ are external
    systems interfaces. The evaluation and mapping centers’ were connected to DSS
    through internet via emails. Human interface such as domain experts (agro-experts/soil
    scientists/agronomists) and end-users (farmers/researchers’) are external human
    interfaces. The interfacing with humans (both experts’/farmers’) has been provided
    through both computer and mobiles/smart phones where the stakeholders can be reached
    through both SMS. Hardware interface (computer/machines/mobiles phones). Software
    interfaces. 4.3.2.1 External system interface (ESI) This interface provides means
    to integrate registered S2M-WSNs with the prototype DSS as well as users through
    their mobile phone via internet/GSM/GPRS. It facilitates the seamless data integration
    between the DSS and registered S2M-WSN entities through a predefined interface
    data frame format and data integration mechanism. This subsection gives insight
    into following: (a) Mobile Phone data Integration/interfacing in which the ESI
    of prototype DSS transmits the alerts/advisories as received from DPE to mobile
    phones/PDAs/Tablets of registered farmers/researchers’/experts via GSM/GPRS technologies.
    This interface provides means to registered users to access alerts/advisories
    can be accessed by the on their mobile phones/laptops whenever required by them.
    This interface empowers the end users with automated and easy availability of
    required and most needed information as and when required. This medium can also
    be used by end-users to register them or to register their requests/feedbacks
    and complaints. (b) Seamless Data integration with S2M-WSN: In order to integrate
    any pre-deployed S2M-WSN with any DSS, the three steps are mandatory. First, they
    must have a uniform data frame format or interface protocol between them. Second,
    there must be a defined set of rules by which the two systems communicates with
    each other. Third and final both should comply unified communication hardware
    at both end. The structure of the data frame format for data integration is given
    in Table 3. Table 3 Data frame format or interface protocol Full size table The
    second part that defines data integration mechanism is presented in the following
    self-explanatory sequence diagram (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Data interaction diagram
    between S2M-DSS Full size image To communicate data between S2M-WSN and prototype
    DSS, GSM technology has been used. Both BS of S2M-WSN and prototype DSS are connected
    via GSM modules (SIM 900) connected at serial port of BS microcontroller hardware
    and personal computer where DSS software is installed and running. The GSM AT
    commands have been used for connections management and sending/receiving the SMS.
    Sample AT Commands are “AT + CMGL” List messages, “AT + CMGR” Read message, “AT + CMGS”
    Send message. The alert/advisory engine in DSS communicates with GSM device serially
    and reads/sends the SMSs using mentioned commands executed in the engine subroutine.
    4.3.2.2 Human computer interface (HCI) A web based solution for HCI has been to
    achieve maximized accessibility. It comprises of interfaces for user authentication
    and management, system configuration to configure the user defined communication
    media to seamlessly integrate DSS with deployed S2M-WSN using pre-defined data
    frame format or interface protocol, data visualization, data analysis, advisory
    menu options. Data visualization displays the data trends, analysis methods, reports
    and results graphically. The expert/scientist can visualize data trends, user
    information (personal and farmland specific details), and user feedback/complaints
    through the GUI. The expert operator can also load the domain knowledge (scientific/mathematical)
    and useful information (user/expert information, feedback/complaints, crop specific
    soil info.) obtained through continuous user interactions and domain knowledge
    (experts’ domain and crop specific knowledge such as usage/requirement of water
    during seeding, germination period and other necessary information into the centralized
    database (DB) and knowledge base (KB) respectively with sub menu options available
    on the GUI. This interface also acts as a mean for domain experts for interaction
    with end users via text messaging/voice call. The end user can access the expert
    advisory anywhere/anytime through user friendly graphical user interface (GUI)
    via internet. Figure 11 displays the one of the web page for prototype DSS where
    the stored data can be visualized. Fig. 11 HCI of prototype DSS Full size image
    4.3.2.3 Data processing engine (DPE) Data processing engine that includes routines
    and software functions for data acquisition in fixed data frame format as per
    pre-defined interface protocol and integration, data source authentication, data
    error checking routines, data quality evaluation algorithms, feature extraction
    and data frame formatting functions. It also provides external system (S2M-WSN)
    interface via GSM using configurable serial data interface. The inbuilt software
    routine in DPE verifies the data source in terms of authenticity of data source,
    format of data packet in reference with interface protocol and release of the
    valid data for further processing. In case authenticity of data fails or data
    is received with inappropriate format, the data is rejected at this point only.
    This routine is also responsible for verification of data quality in terms of
    valid ranges of the data received. For out of ranges data values the error is
    generated and stored in the database (DB) for viewing and display for the expert
    and further processing. Once the data values are received in valid range then
    the desired parameters are extracted from the received data and converted into
    the defined form that can be stored in the DB for further processing and calculation.
    4.3.2.4 Data base (DB) Data base stores the real data as received from the S2M-WSN.
    It also stores the user information, field information (location, crop information
    and applied supplements’) and analytics results and corresponding advisories.
    The DB also stores the crop specific soil suitability information, and other scientific
    and empirical details. The DB is a relational data base is implemented in MySQL.
    In designed DB, WSN identification number is taken as a unique key. The “phpMyadmin”
    tool has been utilized for creating various DB tables. The DB in prototype DSS
    development is named as “myagrisense” which has got interlinked tables for user
    management, data visualization, analysis, advisories and so on. One of the tables,
    the table that stores the incoming data is named as “soil_param_monitored” is
    depicted in Fig. 12. The elements of this table are WSN ID, reading no, soil pH,
    soil moisture, soil EC, soil temperature, air temperature, date and time. Another
    table having advisory details is also depicted in Fig. 13. Fig. 12 Database table
    “soil_param_monitored” Full size image Fig. 13 Database table “advisory” Full
    size image 4.3.2.5 Knowledge base (KB) Knowledge base is architecturally equivalent
    to DB as it stores the relevant information similar to DB but functionally it
    is different from DB as it stores facts about the parameters under observation,
    their thresholds, and other critical information from experts, empirical and statistical
    model information etc. It also stores relevant information about physical, biological
    and other properties important for assessment and evaluation of soils. The KB
    is filled by knowledge engineer through DSS GUI using the domain expert knowledge
    and user experiences. The information from users is gained through personal interactions/seminars/on-field
    visits/surveys/feedback collection mechanisms. The seasonal and crop specific
    needs, geographical and regional information, field specific problems, problems
    faced, are collected from the end users/stakeholders. The acquired knowledge data
    is then coded into a representation scheme to store in KB. The valid knowledge
    can be used in a knowledge-based system to solve new problems via machine inference
    and to explain the generated recommendation. In the given research work, tomato
    crop has been used as a target crop for performance evaluation of the system,
    therefore the KB must contain the necessary information to be considered as inputs
    for KB. Tomato is a warm season crop, it requires warm and cool climate. The plants
    cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also light intensity affects pigmentation,
    fruit color, fruit set. The plant is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions.
    It requires different climatic range for seed germination, seedling growth, flower
    and fruit set, and fruit quality. The requirements of soil and environmental parameters
    to be considered as knowledge for tomato cultivation are as given in Table 4.
    Table 4 Farmland soil KB for different stages of tomato cultivation [47,48,49,50]
    Full size table The requirement of soil temperature needed to be stored in KB
    prior to tomato cultivation is given in Table 5. Table 5 Soil temperature KB for
    different stages of tomato cultivation [47] Full size table 4.3.2.6 Data analytic
    and advisory engine (DA2E) Decision analytic and advisory engine (DA2E) that is
    composed of: (a) Data integrator is software sub routine that integrates incoming
    data between the DPE and alert/advisory engine (DAE) and vice versa. (b) Rule
    Engine queries the pre-loaded rules from the DB and applies on the real-time in
    the database for deeper and detailed analysis. In decision theory, a decision
    rule is a function that maps an observation to an appropriate action. The simple
    expressions in form of an {IF: THEN} expression, (e.g. {IF ‘condition’ THEN ‘result’}
    has been taken as rules. The designed rules are only applicable when its condition
    is satisfied. The evaluation of the rules is directly dependent upon the quality
    of service measures for target application and expected outcome. The proposed
    prototype DSS is intended to provide decision support on farmland assessment and
    crop specific suitability, therefore the rules in proposed system are designed
    based on consultation with domain experts (soil scientists/agronomists’) and end-users.
    The domain expert can edit/delete/add the rules through rule editor in built in
    the prototype DSS. For the target tomato crop, Table 6 depicts rules and associated
    inferences and supporting decisions. Table 6 Rules, inferences and decisions Full
    size table (c) Inference engine draws inference based on the interaction of input
    data and the rule base. It also decides which rules are satisfied by the facts,
    prioritizes them, and executes the rule with the highest priority. It operates
    in cycles, executing a group of tasks until certain criteria causes that halt
    the execution. (d) Statistical analysis engine (SAE) includes software application
    protocol interfaces (APIs) for various statistical operations such as mean, median,
    mode, standard deviation, normalized value, regression analysis and many more.
    The inbuilt APIs can be directly called by the DAE and other consumers through
    SAE. Data analytic engine (DAE) is responsible for analysis of retrieved data
    from the DB by using statistical mechanisms, stored rules and KB. The DAE applies
    the said mechanisms on the valid data. The detailed analysis includes validating
    the normalized values of the stored data for particular day/s or months with the
    pre-stored threshold as part of rules and knowledge base. The normalized sensor
    output Ni given by: $${\text{N}}_{\text{i}} = \frac{{ |{\text{S}}_{\text{i}} -
    {{\mu }}_{\text{i}} |}}{{{{\sigma }}_{\text{i}} {{\tau }}_{\text{i}} }}$$ where
    Si is the current measurement of parameters i\(\epsilon\){soilpH, soilTemp, soilMoist,
    airTemp, sunLight} and µi, σi are the mean and standard deviation over a moving
    time window ω and τi is a sensor based parameter associated with measurement accuracy
    of each ith parameter. To filter baseline (i.e. mean) fluctuations normalized
    sensor outputs Ni have been used. A trigger event (alarm) is activated when normalized
    sensor outputs exhibit sudden and significant changes, given that these changes
    are bounded within the threshold values as per predefined rules. The data analytical
    model is presented in Fig. 14. Fig. 14 Data analysis model utilized in DSS Full
    size image (e) Alerts/advisory engine (A2E) is integral part of proposed DSS.
    It not only accepts the decisions data as generated by the DAE but also map it
    into valid recommendations/advisories/alerts. The decision data is filtered into
    advisories and alerts based on severity of information. It also communicates the
    generated alerts/advisories to data integrator module. As a result of data analysis
    A2E generates advisories and alerts that are automatically sent to registered
    field users on their mobile number in terms of SMS or e-mail. For example if the
    results shows “Extreme deficiency of magnesium in soil” then an alert with “Sprinkle
    dolomite or epsom salt on the soil from time to time, or add a little epsom salt
    to the water at time of irrigation” will automatically sent to end user via SMS.
    For sending of SMS the DSS is interfaced with GSM module via serial port interface
    and software routing is one of the sub modules of main software. (f) Display engine
    (DE) manages the web user interface of proposed DSS. It acts as a manager which
    provides smooth access to users of proposed DSS. It manages functionalities on
    web GUI similar to mobile interface which can be accessed by users via internet.
    5 DSS prototype implementation The proposed DSS can run on a desktop personal
    computer (PC)/laptop with network and serial/USB interfaces. The hardware of proposed
    DSS would include a PC/laptop with WINDOWS 7 or higher version operating system.
    The required specification of the personal computer is 2.70 GHz, 2 GB RAM or more,
    500 GB HDD or more. As DSS is expected to be the repository, user access and information
    processor for all the inbuilt functions. Therefore the speed of CPU and storage
    capacity is of prime interest during selection of hardware configuration. Basically,
    the DSS software includes operating system, web server, and relational database
    management system and web applications. An open-source WAMP [51] software package
    has been installed to use its principle components. WAMP software package contains
    Windows based Apache, MySQL and, PHP language support and it has been widely used
    for development of web server solutions. It also comes with PHPMyAdmin tool to
    easily manage the relational database designed in MySQL. With WAMP, online/offline
    access can be given to everyone or only as local host. The backend application
    for communication media interfacing and data integration has been written in Python
    language. 6 Handling uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness in real time data
    from WSN The accuracy of any decision or predictions generated by any DSS mainly
    depends upon the reliability of the input sensory information. The uncertainty
    associated with input data not only hampers the appropriate operations of the
    mentioned DSSs, but also affects accuracy of decisions and prediction. The uncertainties
    may be due to the incompleteness, ignorance, vagueness, imprecision and ambiguity
    in sensor data. Therefore, it needs to be filtered before feeding a system to
    increase its reliability in making decisions or predictions. Filtering of mentioned
    uncertainties would increase the reliability and the accuracy of the integrated
    S2M-WSN-DSS. There exist a number of methods to handle uncertainty in data such
    as probabilistic methods (objective, experimental, subjective) and heuristic methods
    include certainty factors and fuzzy logic. In the proposed research work, soil
    dataset captured from S2M-WSN usually contains records of farmland environment
    and soil data. It includes a set of information that could reveal new insights
    which would definitely help in efficient classification and assessment of farmland
    soil. A fuzzy-rough based classification approach will be used to handle incomplete
    and inconsistent data [52,53,54]. An ensemble of rule based fuzzy-rough classifier
    shall be built for analyzing captured and stored soil datasets and to handle ambiguity
    and vagueness [55]. Fuzzy set theory has already proven its potential to solve
    uncertainty in data whereas rough set is a new approximation of a crisp set that
    deals with uncertainty in data by using approximation. Uncertain data in a given
    soil data set would be handled by indiscernibility for rough sets and vagueness
    for fuzzy sets [56]. Fuzzy and rough sets are well known for analyzing different
    aspects of uncertainty therefore combination of these techniques will help in
    building a robust mathematical approach for combating the problems of uncertainty.
    7 System deployment and evaluation This section shall discuss the methodology
    adapted for system deployment and performance evaluation. The system validation
    is done through experimentation both in laboratory and real field conditions.
    The WSN system’s performance was evaluated through various performance metrics
    such as soil property measurements, data packet delivery and valid data packet
    delivery rates whereas the DSS is evaluated using response delivery time and system
    response time. Furthermore, the performance was evaluated in real crop conditions.
    The detailed description of system validation and system performance evaluation
    is described in the following subsections. 7.1 System verification 7.1.1 Verification
    in laboratory environment Before deploying a system in real conditions, the foremost
    need is to test all the system components both hardware and software, in test
    laboratory environment. Figure 15 depicts the experimental setup in laboratory.
    The main purpose of testing the system prior to deployment is to verify the behavior
    of system in terms of sensing, collection of sensed information, calibration,
    power consumption, data processing rate followed by data transmission. A systematic
    experimental setup was prepared at embedded Lab of university (latitude 28.6677422,
    longitude 77.22820120000006). Fig. 15 Setup for laboratory experimentation Full
    size image First of all sensor inputs/output circuitry and connections were verified
    and tested. In order to simulate actual field conditions, soil samples were collected
    from three different and distantly located locations in northern India. The three
    soil parameters’ (pH, moisture and temperature) were measured and recorded for
    2 weeks at laboratory room temperature and illumination conditions. The data recording
    was done through standard mobile application as shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 16 Data
    monitored in laboratory experimentation Full size image To validate the recorded
    data values, the same samples were also tested at regular intervals with standard
    soil testing kit using traditional chemical based methods in the same laboratory.
    The similar kits have been widely used in soil and water analysis centers in India.
    The parameter values recorded from both the experiments were compared and a slight
    variation in values had been observed. To minimize the differential variations
    the sensing nodes were manually calibrated by varying the on mote calibration
    resistor. Once the motes are fully calibrated, a set of experiments were then
    conducted to observe the coverage behavior using Omni-directional antennas of
    3 and 15 dBi gain, respectively. Based on coverage tests, verification and validation
    of proposed system was done on the basis of reliability in packet delivery from
    WSN to DSS, battery consumption and validation of alerts generated based on breach
    of predefined thresholds. 7.1.2 Verification in real field environment Based on
    successful validation of integrated WSN-DSS in the laboratory environment, the
    next phase begins with the validation of proposed system in real field conditions.
    The real experimentation was executed with deployment of a small WSN formed with
    five M3SS nodes and a cluster head (Fig. 17) in paddy fields at one of the Krishi
    Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Andhra Pradesh (AP) in the month of June and July 2016.
    The KVKs are agriculture research institutes in different parts of country under
    Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), Govt. of India. The data sensed
    by the deployed WSN was captured by a prototype DSS deployed at embedded lab of
    university via existing GSM based cellular network The DSS supports data logging,
    analysis, decision making and alert generation on registered mobile phones. Fig.
    17 Deployments in real field environment Full size image 7.2 System validation
    and performance evaluation The performance of system is evaluated based on the
    plant growth and yields due to controlled and integrated sensing, monitoring and
    decision support through S2M-WSN-DSS. The experimental tests were conducted to
    construct controlled field conditions based on the feedback and alerts/advisories
    generated by the system. The field conditions have been controlled manually through
    irrigation management and controlled supplement application for the controlled
    conditions of soil temperature, moisture and Ph. The detailed evaluation process
    shall be discussed in next subsections. The first subsection shall discuss the
    growth requirements of selected target crop i.e. tomato followed by field evaluation
    process. 7.2.1 Crop selection Tomato crop was chosen for monitoring and subsequent
    decision support. The tomato is a warm season crop and it requires a warm and
    sunny weather for proper ripening, color and yields. It grows well in sandy loam
    soil with a well-drained clay sub. The sandy soil warms up faster and better drained
    because of which tomato grows well in it. Its growth does not suit the places
    of higher rainfall. The clay loam types of soils have higher water holding capacity
    and provide higher yields but it is more susceptible to root diseases. Therefore
    light soils are good for early variety while clay loan or silt loam soils are
    well suited for heavy yield (Late variety). Tomatoes grow best in soil that is
    just slightly acidic with a pH level at about 5.5–6.8. The pH of soil varies with
    soil temperature and moisture which is mainly affected by the seasonal conditions
    for example in summers, the soil temperature becomes close or becomes greater
    than the air temperature i.e. in months of June–August. The optimum temperature
    for tomato seed germination and its cultivation is 26–32 °C and 15–27 °C, respectively.
    At higher temperature its blossoms drops off. The damages are great when high
    temp is combined with dry wind. It will result in the failure of fruit set due
    to drying of stigmatic liquid. The red color of tomatoes is due the “lycopene”
    pigment which requires 18–32 °C for its optimum production whereas the production
    of this pigment drops off rapidly above 30 °C and reaches ‘nil’ above 40 °C. 7.2.2
    Validation in real crop field environment To validate the performance of S2M-WSN-DSS
    in real crop field environment, a botanical garden was prepared at university
    housing complex area for cultivation of tomato plants in the cropping season from
    April 2017 to July 2017. This location was chosen so that the behavior of system
    can be validated and analyzed locally. The garden was prepared to grow tomatoes
    and evenly divided into 1.5–2.0 m beds with double row on 1.5–2.0 m bed, with
    30–50 cm distance between rows having 5–6 plants/meter/bed [57]. Each mote was
    installed on edge of each bed and the soil sensors were distributed and deployed
    into the bed at predefined locations using the previous knowledge of farm soil
    variability. The cluster head (CH) were installed at the center of the test bed
    whereas the BS was deployed in the center of the field equidistant from each cluster
    head. In the deployed S2M-WSN, the three soil sensors (pH, temperature, and moisture)
    are placed at depth of 20 cm respectively from a representative dripper and at
    20 cm from the tomato plant whereas the light sensor and air temperature sensors
    were inbuilt into the M3SS mote itself. The ten nos. of M3SS motes in form of
    two clusters each having four nos. of motes, configured as sensing nodes communicate
    with each respective fourth node configured as cluster head over ZigBee. The cluster
    head preprocess and aggregates the sensed packets and transmits the aggregated
    packet to BS over ZigBee that logs and routes the formatted packet to remotely
    located DSS over GSM network. Figure 18 depicts the real crop field deployment
    of S2M-WSN in the tomato garden. The BS is installed with a support of 1.5 m height
    pole. It is also equipped with a solar panel of 30 W and 18.0 V an external battery
    with 6.5 Ah lead acidic batteries (12.0 V). Fig. 18 Deployments in real crop field
    environment Full size image To analyze the captured data, a prototype DSS similar
    to laboratory experimentation was established at university embedded lab for data
    analysis. The embedded lab is distantly located from the tomato garden. The PC
    installed with DSS software and configured with GSM module is located at the embedded
    laboratory in university. The data visualization tool inbuilt in DSS shows the
    data table with recorded data on DSS UI. The collected data from the S2M-WSN and
    alerts generated by the prototype DSS were captured at mobile application. Based
    on the data captured, the performance of the S2M-WSN is evaluated based on various
    metrics such as valid data delivery and communication reliability, battery usage,
    time taken in data uploading and alert generation and system response time. 7.2.3
    Soil data measurements The S2M-WSN system was deployed at university botanical
    garden in March 2017. Due to the varying environmental factors such as air temperature,
    sunlight, soil conditions and associated gardening activities such as irrigation,
    addition of compost and soil preparations, the locations of sensing nodes, the
    cluster head and base-station were modified and finalized in April 2017. A desktop
    computer was installed with prototype DSS software and database, was deployed
    at distantly located embedded lab and communication was established between the
    BS of S2M-WSN and prototype DSS through GSM based cellular network. Since then,
    the whole network including S2M-WSN-DSS had been running under formal operations.
    Figure 19 depicts the graphical variation of monitored and captured data acquired
    from deployed mote 3 from May 7th 2017 to July 7th 2017. The soil sensors were
    buried underground at the depth of 10 cm. The developed integrated S2M-WSN-DSS
    system was able to accomplish the desired tasks as expected. Fig. 19 Graphical
    depiction data variation/trend during observation period Full size image 7.2.4
    Performance metrics The performance of proposed integrated S2M-WSN-DSS system
    has been validated and analyzed by using a set of performance metrics which shall
    be discussed in following subsection. 7.2.4.1 Data packet delivery rates The performance
    of S2M-WSN is analyzed in terms of %age data packets transmitted by S2M-WSN and
    received by DSS. Since the communication media in between the two sub systems
    is wireless, hence it will prone to packet drops. The performance is of S2M-WSN
    analyzed in terms of both total data packets received and valid data packets received.
    Both these factors define the reliability in data communication. If Nt and \({\text{N}}_{\text{r}}\)
    defines the total no of transmitted data packets and total no of received data
    packets then data packet reception rate (η) in percentage is defined as: $${{\eta
    }} = \frac{{{\text{N}}_{r} }}{{{\text{N}}_{t} }} \times 100.$$ Due to the wireless
    propagation data packet through the network, there is always probability that
    few fields of the data packet gets corrupted or dropped or might contain invalid
    data values due to random channel behavior, link failures or signal attenuation
    due to other environmental effects. Each invalid data were deposited as “NULL”
    in data repository/database. A valid data rate (ηv) was defined as: $${{\eta }}_{\text{v}}
    = \frac{{{\text{N}}_{v} }}{{ {\text{N}}_{r} }} \times 100$$ where \({\text{N}}_{\text{r}}
    , {\text{and N}}_{\text{v}}\) is the total number of received data packet and
    total number of received valid packets at the repository of prototype DSS from
    S2M-WSN during a certain period of time. With higher Nv, ηv would be higher and
    data communication would be more reliable which lead to more reliable system.
    In practical scenario, during the data transmission, on-field plant canopy commonly
    cause radio signal attenuation. Meanwhile, competition among data upload could
    introduce logical failures. As discussed, the system performance greatly depends
    upon higher \({\text{N}}_{\text{v}}\). Therefore, in order to increase \({\text{N}}_{\text{v}}\),
    the DSS shall request the data packets from BS requesting data from specific sensing
    node in S2M-WSN whenever data is not received in stipulated time interval or in
    case of invalid data packet reception from that particular node. The request is
    made through the base station to each nth node. Each request invokes the idle
    nth node and awakes it from sleep mode so that it retransmits the latest data.
    In this manner the value of \({\text{N}}_{\text{v}}\) tends to equalize with \({\text{N}}_{\text{r}}\)
    and \({\text{N}}_{\text{t}}\) which makes the system stability better. 7.2.4.2
    Support delivery performance ratio (SDPR) The simplest and most important performance
    indicator of the designed DSS is the support delivery performance ratio. The main
    aim of agricultural DSS is to support the farmers with right decision support
    at right time. The support in terms of advisories shall be delivered in time and
    the support delivery performance must be high. It is measured in %age and defined
    through the following empirical formula $$SDPR = \frac{Actual\, Deleivered \,Support\,
    Advisories }{Total \,No \,of \,Advisory\, Generated}.$$ This SDPR measures the
    extent to which the advisories generated by the system are actually getting delivered
    to the register users as intended during a selected period (which may range from
    day to week, months) at any location of the end user. The primary utility of the
    SDPR is to identify whether the system generated advisories are getting delivered
    less or more at any location intended or not. This ratio is calculated by assuming
    the availability of cellular network services at all time. 7.2.4.3 Response time
    and throughput The system response time basically measures the total time that
    a system takes to process a request or transaction including latency. The time
    taken in processing a single request/transaction are not always represents the
    system’s typical response time. Therefore the average of response time of many
    requests is usually taken to calculate the good measure of system’s typical response
    time. The unit of response time is generally taken as “requests/second” or “transactions/second”.
    The throughput of the system is linearly related with the response time and usually
    defined as reciprocals of one another. The following formula has been used to
    determine \(T_{response}\), the response time (in s) at peak load where peak load
    is the point at which requests/transaction per minute start to decline. $$T_{response
    } = \frac{No\, of\, Concurrent\, Users\left( N \right)}{Requests\, the\, system\,
    request\, per\, second\left( R \right)} - T_{processing}$$ Here \(T_{processing
    }\) is the time taken by the system to process the transaction or request. 8 Results
    and discussion 8.1 Sensor data measurements As discussed earlier, data acquired
    from deployed node 3 from May 7th 2017 to 7th July 2017 are shown in Fig. 18.
    The designed and developed integrated system was able to accomplish the expected
    monitoring efficiently. All the variations were smoothly captured and reported
    to DSS. The performance of the designed system in terms of monitored data is depicted
    after statistical analysis. Table 7 shows the statistical soil data measured by
    the system in 3 months. Table 7 Statistical soil data measurement Full size table
    The parameters were monitored and stored in database at DSS. The week wise mean
    value of each parameter was automatically calculated and updated in the system
    for analysis. Each column of Table 3 describes week wise mean variation of measured
    values. In real deployment, the soil samples from the same location were also
    manually measured for reference duration using chemical based soil testing kit
    to check the validity of the captured data. The manually tested results are not
    shown in this paper but were equally matched with measured ones. 8.2 Data packet
    delivery rates The performance of data packet delivery is evaluated in terms of
    the packet delivery rates (η, ηv). Both the rates were calculated based on recorded
    data from May 7th 2017 to 7th July 2017. The averaged packet delivery rate (η)
    and the averaged valid packet delivery rate was found to be 93.89% and the averaged
    packet delivery rate 97.61%, respectively. The graph of both rate values (η, ηv)
    from each deployed sensor node are depicted in Figs. 20 and 21, respectively.
    Both η and ηv of sensor node 6 was extremely low as it was located at a farthest
    distance from the base station. The minimum valid data rate was 91.9% obtained
    from Node 3’s reading whereas the measurements from all the other sensor nodes
    represent valid data rates above 97%. Fig. 20 Data packet delivery rate Full size
    image Fig. 21 Valid packet delivery rate Full size image In summary, the developed
    system performed exceptionally well and satisfactorily during the field deployment.
    It has also shown advantages of network topology that enables continuous and reliable
    data collection. The overall system provides features of automated data uploading
    and logging in base station and DSS database respectively where the logged data
    was transacted over ZigBee till base station and over cellular network to DSS.
    The users of system can easily access the database through mobile phones that
    empower them with real, right and relevant information at right time when they
    needed the most. This enhances their decision making capability to many folds.
    8.3 Support delivery performance ratio (SDPR) During the entire prototyping and
    experimentation, approximately 50 nos. of times the value of soil temperature
    and moisture exceeds the threshold limit and alerts have been generated by the
    DSS. On the same time advisories with respect to generated alerts have been generated
    and communicated to the registered mobile number. Out of 50 nos. of generated
    advisories, approximately 47 messages have been successfully delivered which makes
    the SDPR of system near about 94%. The SDPR of the system is dependent upon the
    cellular service to a large extent. The loss of 6% advisories is due to the cellular
    network service. 8.4 System response time (SRT) The response time of the system
    is tested with two nos. of con current users (assumption) as only two mobile nos.
    has been registered in the system database. It is also assumed that system will
    automatically send advisories on the two mobile numbers as and when threshold
    breaches. The threshold breach is considered as one of the request. The time to
    process the data base query was measured using measurement of system time before
    and after execution of each database query. The small latency value has been manually
    added to each calculation and it was found that the response time of the system
    is near to real time and it ranges from few second to minutes depending on the
    availability of congestion free cellular network. 8.5 Impact on plant growth and
    yield In order to observe the plant growth, few plants were selected as reference
    plants in each cluster area of the garden. Then the plant height was measured
    manually on these plants three times a week and significant growth in height was
    observed during observation weeks. Further the effect of each soil parameter on
    plant height is analyzed and the variation of same is as shown in Fig. 22. Fig.
    22 Impact on plant height growth Full size image During the observation period,
    the deviations in measured parameters from optimal ranges were recorded automatically
    by the DSS. In case of threshold breach, alerts with remedial advisories has been
    automatically generated and communicated to registered farmers/end users on their
    mobile phones as shown in figure. The rule of alerts and advisories generated
    by the DSS is given in table 6. To comply the expert guidance (advisories) given
    by the system, the garden soil conditions were manually controlled by applying
    the suitable supplements/irrigation/fertilizers etc. till the optimal condition
    for tomato crop growth and disease reduction as defined in section were achieved.
    The measurements were recorded and analyzed iteratively in closed loop manner.
    The soil parameters were monitored and controlled by applying the suitable supplements
    based on the parametric variation monitored till the optimum condition suitable
    for tomato crop growth and disease reduction were achieved. The foremost requirement
    for tomato crop growth requires very stable temperature ranges with minimum temperature
    is around 10 °C and maximum being 34 °C and optimum temperatures ranges from 26
    to 29 °C. Inadequate temperature variation may result into poor fruit quality
    or reduced yields. Therefore, based on the monitored data, whenever the system
    generates alerts/alarm of ‘temperature exceeded optimal range’ the inadequate
    temperature variation was taken care by two actions via. (i) the crop field was
    covered with polycover and the plant area was converted into ‘green house’. (ii)
    to lower the soil temperature the plant area was irrigated. The user was supported
    through SMS such as higher temperature: poly cover advised and/or irrigate the
    field which assists him in taking right decisions/actions or counter measures.
    9 Conclusion and future scope of work The paper has discussed the design of both
    WSN and DSS and their integration for prototype deployment in tomato garden. The
    design of both WSN and DSS is presented with their validation in laboratory as
    well as in real conditions before actual deployment. The various issues such as
    power depletion, node ruggedness, node failure in harsh environment, failure in
    data packets and missing data values have been observed. The DSS prototype has
    been designed for experimentation purpose. The WSN coverage and deployment strategies
    for different crop, rule design, exact calculation mechanism for response time
    calculation of DSS, GUI finalization and development of rule editor shall be taken
    as a future scope of work. Currently the rules and associated advisories (text)
    has to be added for a new crop for analysis which is the limitation of system.
    The research work for handling uncertainty in real life soil data using hybrid
    approach which is combination of fuzzy and rough set and auto generation of rules
    shall be taken up in future as future scope of work. The authors believe that
    the complete design and development of whole integrated system will resolve many
    decision related issues of farmers and shall also empower them with DSS that gives
    online support based on data analysis of S2WSN data. This system will definitely
    provide a break through of many problem the end users faces during complete harvesting
    period. The system also makes farmers familiarize about use of ICT in agriculture.

    3232 Accesses Abstract As developments in information and communication technologies
    increase, new opportunities are becoming available to refine agronomic management.
    Precision agriculture, or site-specific crop management, is a farm management
    concept based on observing and responding to intra field variability. This concept
    is being increasingly applied to irrigation and fertilizer management with the
    aid of remote sensors of vegetation in the visible and thermal bands and automatic
    guidance systems based on precision GPS. Remote sensing is the acquisition of
    information about an object without making physical contact by using satellites,
    aircraft, and/or land platforms. Other tools include crop simulation models which
    are computer programs with equations that represent the response of the crop to
    management practices (e.g. planting density) and the environment (meteorology,
    soil). They may be combined with remote sensing data for large scale analyses
    and predictions and for refining site-specific management. Keywords Management

    started around 10,000 years ago and since then, improvements of agricultural technology
    have contributed to increasing the productivity. Intensive agriculture in the
    second half of the twentieth century was able to achieve high productivity from
    high inputs but also with some important environmental impacts . The next step
    in agricultural technology is based on the use of proximal or remote sensors and
    computers that allow a more precise and/or efficient application of inputs in
    the field. This is based on the improved knowledge of crop physiology and the
    advances of agronomy during the twentieth century. At this point we see that agriculture
    evolved from low input/low control to high input/low control during the 1950s–1960s
    and is now turning to optimal input based on high control. In this chapter we
    review some of the technologies that contribute to better control in crop management
    . 2 Remote Sensing Principles 2.1 Definition of Remote Sensing Remote sensing
    can be defined as the acquisition of information about an object without making
    physical contact. Although it has been generally related to the acquisition of
    images from satellite platforms, the term remote sensing is actually broader and
    it relates to data collection from objects without physical contact. In other
    words, remote sensing is both the acquisition of data from long distances (i.e.
    36,000 km from the Earth using a satellite ) as well as that obtained at just
    a few centimeters using a camera or an instrument that we place near the object
    (i.e. a leaf). 2.2 Active and Passive Remote Sensing The remote sensing of objects
    using different types of sensors is necessarily conducted through a physical carrier
    that travels from the objects to the sensors through an intervening medium. This
    carrier in remote sensing is the electromagnetic radiation, and the medium is
    the atmosphere. A general classification of remote sensing can be made depending
    on the nature of the radiation used to gather information from the objects: (i)
    active remote sensing is when a signal is emitted and received by the sensor used,
    and (ii) passive remote sensing uses naturally occurring energy (e.g. reflected
    from solar radiation ). 2.3 The Electromagnetic Spectrum and the Spectral Bands
    Electromagnetic radiation is energy propagated through space between electric
    and magnetic fields. The electromagnetic spectrum is the extent of that energy
    ranging from cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays to ultraviolet, visible, and infrared
    radiation including microwave energy as a function of their wavelength (Fig. 33.1).
    Fig. 33.1 The electromagnetic spectrum classified as a function of wavelengths
    Full size image Our eyes detect radiation in the so-called “visible” spectral
    region, ranging between 400 and 700 nm in wavelength. Nevertheless, there are
    sensors that can detect and measure radiation coming from below and above the
    visible spectral region, i.e. below 400 nm and above 700 nm wavelengths. Remote
    sensing of objects is generally conducted with sensors working in wavelengths
    in the ultra-violet (UV) below the visible region, and then in the reflected infrared,
    thermal infrared and microwaves in the spectral region above the visible part
    of the spectrum. It is important to clarify that above the visible region some
    sensors detect reflected radiation while others detect the emitted radiation.
    The reflected infrared region therefore is used to collect data in the infrared
    wavelengths reflected by the objects, while the thermal infrared region is used
    to gather emitted radiation to obtain information about the object’s temperature.
    2.4 The Concept of Multispectral The collection of reflected or emitted data by
    sensors needs to be conducted in the so-called “spectral bands”. This is because
    each detector used to collect reflected or emitted energy is sensitive to a different
    range and number of these specific spectral bands. The width in wavelengths units
    and the number of these spectral bands enable the acquisition of data from objects
    in a multispectral way. Therefore, multispectral remote sensing is defined as
    the collection of reflected or emitted energy from an object in multiple bands
    of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 33.2). The more the number of bands, and
    the narrower these bands are, the more information can be gathered from the object.
    Fig. 33.2 Multispectral remote sensing Full size image 2.5 Reflectance and Spectral
    Signatures The energy measured by the sensor is a function of the total incoming
    radiation at such particular moment. In other words, measuring the energy reflected
    by the same object at two different times would give us a different amount if
    the energy coming from the sun changes. For this reason, remote sensing methods
    rely on normalizing such reflected energy to the incoming radiation at the time
    of the measurement. Reflectance is defined as the ratio of the total amount of
    radiation reflected by a surface to the total amount of radiation incident on
    the surface. Remote sensing methods are based on this reflectance as a function
    of wavelength, developing the so-called spectral signatures (Fig. 33.3). In Fig.
    33.3 we can observe the reflectance measured for three different objects: (i)
    green vegetation; (ii) dry vegetation; and (iii) soil. The amount of reflected
    energy changes as a function of the wavelength, which is function of the pigment
    absorbing and reflecting energy from each object under study. By looking and analyzing
    these spectral signatures it is possible to infer the status of the vegetation
    and soils by estimating the amount of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll content,
    carotenoids, xanthophylls), the amount of vegetation layers (leaf area index ,
    canopy densities), and water content , among others. Fig. 33.3 Spectral signatures
    from green vegetation, dry vegetation and soil Full size image 2.6 Remote Sensing
    Resolution There are four definitions than are critical in remote sensing to understand
    the data quality and image characteristics: (i) spatial resolution. (ii) spectral
    resolution, (iii) radiometric resolution and (iv) temporal resolution. Spatial
    resolution is the size of a pixel that is recorded in an image typically corresponding
    to square areas. The minimum detail discernible in an image is dependent on the
    spatial resolution of the sensor and refers to the size of the smallest possible
    feature that can be detected. The spatial resolution of passive sensors depends
    primarily on their Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) of the system comprised
    by the detector and the lens. The area on the ground represented in the pixel
    is called the resolution cell and determines a sensor’s maximum spatial resolution.
    Spectral resolution is the wavelength width and the number of the different frequency
    bands recorded by the detector, which determine the spectral signatures used to
    assess the objects by remote sensing methods. Radiometric resolution is defined
    as the number of different intensities of radiation the sensor is able to distinguish.
    Typically, this ranges from 8 to 14 bits, corresponding to 256 levels of the grayscale
    and up to 16,384 intensities in each band. It also depends on the instrument noise.
    Temporal resolution is the frequency of satellite or plane overpasses over the
    same place. The temporal resolution is relevant in time-series studies in cases
    in which collecting data over the same site is required to understand seasonal
    changes. 3 Sensors and Platforms for Remote Sensing The sensors are generally
    classified as: (i) optical; and (ii) microwave sensors. Optical sensors detect
    visible and infrared radiation in different sub-regions: (i) near infrared, (ii)
    intermediate infrared and (iii) thermal infrared. There are two types of radiation
    that can be measured from optical sensors: (i) visible/near infrared (reflected);
    and (ii) thermal infrared (emitted). In the Visible and Near Infrared region the
    sensors detect radiation of sunlight reflected by the objects which is used to
    quantify land surface conditions such as the distribution of plants, forests and
    farm fields, rivers, lakes, urban areas, etc. Obviously this technique can only
    be used during the daytime under clear sky conditions. In the Thermal Infrared
    region the detected radiation is that emitted by the objects, which is typically
    used to monitor the temperature of the land’s surface (see Chap. 3) and is not
    restricted to the daytime period but is affected by cloudiness . Microwave sensors
    may be active or passive and are designed to measure radiation in the microwave
    spectral region, with longer wavelengths than those of the visible and infrared
    regions. The observation is not affected by period (day or night) or weather as
    microwaves penetrate the clouds. The platforms generally used for remote sensing
    can be divided into the following classes: (a) proximal sensing platforms are
    used for acquiring high spatial resolution imagery from towers, cherry pickers,
    trucks and mobile platforms in the field. (b) airborne platforms (i.e. planes
    of different sizes and weights) are generally used for acquiring imagery at typical
    altitudes between 300 m and a few kilometers over the ground. They can be divided
    into manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. 1. Manned vehicles are the traditional
    platforms for aerial photography and remote sensing operations using heavy cameras
    working in the visible, near infrared and thermal regions. Access to these sensors
    is limited, as they have a high cost of operation, so they are generally used
    for research purposes but sometimes for operational applications. Sensors that
    can be installed in these platforms are generally very expensive, but they obtain
    very high quality imagery which helps validating remote sensing model s and methods.
    2. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) also known as Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAS)
    or “drones ” are new methods recently available which are the result of transferring
    this technology from the military to civil applications. These drones are small
    planes that can fly autonomously over desired areas at low altitudes, therefore
    acquiring high resolution imagery using miniature sensors carried on-board. Wingspan
    and weight for these platforms range between less than a meter up to 5 m, and
    between under 2 kg up to several hundred kilograms. The sensors used weigh between
    a few grams up to several kilograms, and they are currently available to collect
    images from drones in the visible, near infrared and thermal regions. Despite
    the legal limitations on the use of drones for civil applications, they offer
    high flexibility in acquiring imagery at low cost, higher spatial resolution and
    easy operation by end users. (c) The satellite platforms follow typically elliptical
    orbits around the earth. The time taken to complete one revolution of the orbit
    is called the orbital period. The satellite traces a path on the earth surface
    as it moves across the sky. As the earth below is rotating, the satellite traces
    a different path on the ground in each subsequent cycle. Remote sensing satellites
    are launched into orbits such that the satellite repeats its path after a fixed
    time interval. This time interval is called the repeat cycle of the satellite
    . When a satellite follows an orbit parallel to the equator in the same direction
    as the earth’s rotation and with the same period of 24 h, the satellite will appear
    stationary with respect to the earth surface. In other words, the satellite will
    be positioned all the time over the same spot over the Earth. This orbit is called
    geostationary. Satellites in the geostationary orbits are located at a high altitude
    of 36,000 km. The geostationary orbits are commonly used by meteorological satellites
    as they can monitor large areas continuously (i.e. acquiring one image every 30
    or 60 min to monitor weather). A near polar orbit is one with the orbital plane
    inclined at a small angle with respect to the earth’s rotation axis. A satellite
    following a properly designed near polar orbit passes close to the poles and is
    able to cover nearly the whole earth surface in a repeat cycle. Nevertheless,
    earth observation satellites usually follow sun synchronous orbits, i.e. an orbit
    whose altitude is such that the satellite will always pass over a location at
    a given latitude at the same local solar time. In this way, the same solar illumination
    condition can be achieved for the images of a given location taken by the satellite.
    As a function of the orbit (distance to the Earth) and the type of sensors carried
    by the satellite platform, the satellite imaging systems can be classified into
    low (>1000 m), medium (100–1000 m), high (5–100 m) and very high resolution (<5
    m). 4 Site-Specific Irrigation Management 4.1 Site-Specific Crop Management Although
    the term precise irrigation usually refers to the application of precise amounts
    of water to crops at precise locations and at precise times – but uniformly across
    the field–, precision irrigation, as part of the precision agriculture concept,
    differs markedly from this common meaning. Precision agriculture, or site-specific
    crop management , is a farming management concept based on observing and responding
    to intra field variability . Precision agriculture has been practiced for site-specific
    nutrient or pesticide application, for varying seeding rate , for control of traffic
    on fields, etc. Precision irrigation falls in the precision agriculture category
    since it consists on the application of water to predefined zones in a volume
    and at a time needed for optimum crop production, maximum profitability or other
    management objective at each particular zone in the field. Precision agriculture
    involves a number of methods, technologies and equipment. Site-specific (SS) irrigation
    has so far been developed commercially for self-propelled center pivot and linear
    move irrigation systems, whereas site-specific microirrigation (drip/trickle,
    microsprinkler ) has not yet emerged from academia or industry. Center pivot and
    linear move manufacturers have produced commercial equipment to regulate water
    application in time and space (VRI , variable rate irrigation). The irrigation
    machine is governed by a GPS controller and the operator can enter irrigation
    prescriptions in the control panel directly or remotely. Prescriptions are based
    on maps of soil and crop attributes. Moreover, field-distributed sensors can collect
    and transmit data to support real-time management decisions. 4.2 Opportunities
    Provided by Site-Specific Irrigation SS-VRI adapted to center pivot or linear
    move machines allows stopping irrigation over roads, ponds, water courses, rocky
    outcrops, or any other landscape element that doES not require irrigation. If
    various crops are grown under the same center pivot or linear move system, irrigation
    can be scheduled according to the needs of each crop. Another situation for using
    SS irrigation is when runoff occurs. This is more likely to happen in steep slopes,
    where soil infiltration capacity is low, and at the distal end of center pivots
    , where the application rate is highest. SS-VRI allows applying water at reduced
    rate at the zones where infiltration should be increased to minimize runoff .
    The irrigation machine should then move at slower speed to maintain the irrigation
    depth uniform. The response of yield to evapotranspiration of most crops is a
    linear function (Chap. 14). If irrigation ensures that the field does not suffer
    water scarcity at all, then yield would be maximal and SS irrigation would not
    represent any yield advantage. However, some indeterminate crops and trees yield
    maximum under moderate deficit irrigation . For those crops, any deviation from
    optimal evapotranspiration will translate into yield loss . This deviation may
    be caused by variations in soil water storage due to precipitation (rain, snow
    or irrigation) non-uniformity, to variability of the soil water holding capacity
    , and to lateral flow during or after the precipitation event. In very arid environments,
    rainfall contribution to soil water storage is usually negligible for irrigated
    crops. There, uniform irrigation designed to prevent surface flow will result
    in uniform soil water storage as long as irrigation is scheduled for the field
    zone where the critical soil water deficit (SWDc , Chap. 20) is lowest. Therefore,
    in arid and semiarid environments, SS irrigation does not help in saving water
    or improving yield. The situation is different in sub-humid or Mediterranean environments,
    where the contribution of rainfall to the water consumption of irrigated crops
    may be significant. Using SS-VRI , the irrigation depth can be adjusted to each
    zone by applying less water where the water storage is greater. The crop will
    keep using the rainfall water storage, where available, so total irrigation will
    be reduced. Evapotranspiration differences may occur across the field due to differences
    in canopy cover. An appropriate way to estimate evapotranspiration for SS irrigation
    schedules is computing spatially distributed crop coefficients based on multispectral
    vegetation indices that are related to the fraction of intercepted radiation as
    the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The so derived evapotranspiration
    would account for the spatial variation of canopy cover and would represent the
    water needs of the non-stressed crop. The idea is only valid before full canopy
    cover. 4.3 Definition of Management Zones The technique most widely used by site-specific
    irrigation practitioners to define field zones is electromagnetic induction survey
    of soil apparent electrical conductivity (EMI-ECa). In non-saline soils , EMI-ECa
    varies primarily with soil texture , water content , and cation exchange capacity.
    Therefore, EMI-ECa maps are used in combination with soil sampling to determine
    those spatially variable soil properties efficiently. EMI-ECa mapping is usually
    complemented by topographic , yield, soil, and multispectral vegetation indices
    maps to delimit management zones. Canopy temperature of crops entering into crop
    water stress could be used to determine the spatial variability of the critical
    soil water deficit . If the crop is not watered for some time after heavy rainfall
    or uniform irrigation, canopy temperature will increase first where SWDc is lowest.
    Continuous monitoring of soil water content or potential allows introducing real
    time management decisions. The location of the sampling points may be based on
    EMI-ECa maps. Neutron probes provide accurate measurements of soil water content
    , but are expensive and labor intensive. Capacitance sensors are inaccurate for
    determining soil water content due to the multiple environmental effects that
    affect their readings. Travel time sensors (e.g. TDR) are more accurate than capacitance
    sensors and are becoming less expensive and more adaptable to field conditions.
    Tensiometers are difficult to maintain in the field. However, resistance blocks
    can be left installed in the field and connected to dataloggers and wireless transmitters.
    Their problem is that they may lose contact with the soil matrix as it dries.
    The development of robust wireless networks is facilitating the installation of
    sensors in the field without interference with cropping operations. An alternative
    to soil water measurement is sensing plant water status. Canopy temperature has
    been used since the 1980s to determine crop water stress indices. Stationary infrared
    thermometers installed at strategic locations pointing to the crop canopy, or
    moving sensors mounted on the sprinkler lateral to scan the crop across the field,
    can be connected to dataloggers and wireless transmitters to continuously measure
    canopy temperature. Satellite and airborne high-resolution visible and thermal
    infrared images provide snapshots of canopy cover and temperature over the entire
    field. These are zenithal views that, under partial ground cover, integrate soil
    and vegetation, making difficult discriminating plant stress from dry soil effects.
    Infrared sensors mounted on center pivot laterals change their orientation with
    respect to the sun and the crop rows, which affects temperature readings. This
    is less of a problem if mounted on linear move laterals. There are several handicaps
    for the adoption of remote sensing techniques in SS irrigation. Satellite images
    are inexpensive, but their frequency and/or spatial resolution might be insufficient.
    Aerial imagery may be expensive for the required frequency. The apparatus involved
    in mounting sensors on the moving lateral has been a handicap for commercial application.
    The other barrier for adoption of this type of information is the difficulty for
    farmers to understand and process this information in a timely manner. 5 Positioning
    and Automation High precision positioning systems like GPS are key technologies
    for precision, site-specific agriculture. The systems record the geographic coordinates
    of the field and management zones and locate and navigate agricultural vehicles
    with accuracy of few cm. There are different levels of automated steering. Assisted
    steering systems simply show drivers the path to follow in the field, thus the
    farmer still needs to steer the wheel. Automated steering systems take full control
    of the steering wheel along the row, allowing the driver to watch the machine
    in use (sprayer, seeder). Intelligent guidance systems allow different guidance
    patterns adapted to the shape of the field. Management zone maps, automated steering,
    and variable rate technology are used jointly to adjust machines to apply, for
    instance, seed or fertilizer according to the spatial variations in plant needs.
    Data sensors can be mounted on moving machines also. Grain yield monitoring is
    becoming very popular. It consists of devices and sensors installed in the harvester
    that calculate and record grain yield and machine position as it moves. Yield
    maps can be useful for delineating management zones. 6 Crop Simulation Model s,
    Expert Systems and Information Technologies A crop simulation model is an abstract,
    mathematical model that captures the behavior of the crop in response to the environment
    and management throughout the growing season. The model is converted to a computer
    program with equations that represent the response of the crop to management practices
    (e.g. planting density) and the environment (meteorological, soil). Therefore
    the model behaves similarly (and roughly) than the real crop, so we may perform
    virtual experiments that may help in crop management or genotype evaluation. The
    obvious advantage is that the model may be applied to a wide range of climates
    or soils thereby expanding the limited knowledge obtained from field experiments.
    However, models are always simplified representations of actual systems, so we
    have to be very careful in selecting the right model and test it against experimental
    data. Crop simulation models may be classified according to different criteria:
    (a) Empirical versus mechanistic: an empirical model relates yield to a set of
    environmental or management variables. For instance in arid and semi-arid areas
    yield may be calculated as a linear function of seasonal rainfall. On the other
    hand a mechanistic model is based on the biological, chemical and physical mechanisms
    related to plant growth, development and yield. (b) Black-box versus comprehensive:
    This classification is parallel to the previous. A black-box model simply relates
    (empirically) the inputs and outputs of a system, without any information on how
    the system works. A comprehensive model represents the system (e.g. crop) by equations
    that explain the functioning of the organizational level below (e.g. plant, organ).
    Take for instance wheat production in a farm as affected by nitrogen. We could
    write a black-box model at the entry of the farm by simply recording the amount
    of fertilizer N that goes into the farm and the amount of wheat that goes out.
    Note that in this case we have no idea of what’s going on in there but in the
    long run we may be able to predict wheat yields of the farm as a function of purchased
    N fertilizer. The comprehensive model would require entering the farm, collecting
    data (soil, weather, management) and setting up a model of wheat growth as affected
    by N and other factors. It is clear that a black-box model is cheap and easy to
    develop but is not valid for other systems. (c) Specificity: Some crop models
    have been built for a single crop species (e.g. Oilcrop-Sun for sunflower ) while
    others are valid for any species (e.g. Wofost). The former are more detailed and
    use parameters to characterize the different cultivars while the latter use different
    parameters for each species. Most existing crop model s have been built for annual
    species while only a few have been developed for fruit trees (e.g. Olive Can for
    olive s) because of the lower importance, the larger complexity and the scarcity
    of good data sets for calibration and validation. Crop simulation models are not
    only an alternative to field experiments but are the only choice for evaluating
    crop production under non existing conditions. For instance predictions of the
    impact of global change in agriculture are based on crop simulation models. Something
    similar happens with the evaluation of non-existing genotypes that may be tested
    using a model in order to identify characters that should be incorporated in breeding
    programs Although primitive crop models may be traced to the 1960s with the work
    of de Wit in The Netherlands and Loomis in the USA, the first large scale attempt
    at developing general use crop models for the main crops species (wheat, maize)
    occurred in the USA during the late 1970s and was led by Ritchie, Kiniry and Jones.
    The primary interest for the USA was strategic , i.e. being able to predict crop
    yields of their main rivals at the time (USSR, China). Pretty soon this effort
    was abandoned and crop modelling became a very useful tool in agronomy around
    the world. Crop models may be integrated in a decision support system (DSS), a
    software package including also other tools for input data management and output
    data analysis, such as in DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer
    ). A more sophisticated tool is an expert system which is a computer application
    with learning capacity intended to operate like a human expert. In general an
    expert system includes a data base and sometimes also a crop simulation model
    (e.g. model Gossym in expert system COMAX for cotton ). Available information
    technologies (powerful cell phones, wireless sensors) will facilitate the development
    of very specific applications for crop management incorporation crop models, DSS
    and expert systems. Bibliography Campbell, J. B., & Wynne, R. H. (2013). Introduction

    It is increasingly recognized that water scarcity, rather than a lack of arable
    land,

    will be the major constraint to increase agricultural production over the next
    few

    decades. Therefore, water represents a unique agricultural asset to drive agricultural

    sustainability. However, its planning, management and usage are often inﬂuenced
    by

    a mix of interdependent economic, engineering, social, hydrologic, environmental,
    and

    even political factors. Such a complex interdependency suggests that a sociotechnical

    approach to water resources management, a subject of the ﬁeld of Hydroinformatics,

    represents a viable path forward to achieve sustainable agriculture. Thus, this
    paper

    presents an overview of the intersection between hydroinformatics and agriculture

    to introduce a new research ﬁeld called agricultural hydroinformatics. In addition,
    it

    proposes a general conceptual framework taking into account the distinctive features

    associated with the sociotechnical dimension of hydroinformatics when applied
    in

    agriculture. The framework is designed to serve as a stepping-stone to achieve,

    not only integrated water resources management, but also agricultural sustainability

    transitions in general. Using examples from agricultural water development to
    horticultural

    and livestock farming, the paper highlights facets of the framework applicability
    as a

    new paradigm on data ﬂows/sources consideration, and information and simulation

    models engineering as well as integration for a holistic approach to water resources

    management in agriculture. Finally, it discusses opportunities and challenges
    associated

    with the implementation of agricultural hydroinformatics and the development of
    new

    research areas needed to achieve the full potential of this emerging framework.
    These

    areas include, for example, sensor deployment and development, signal processing,

    information modeling and storage, artiﬁcial intelligence, and new kind of simulation
    model

    development approaches.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    1. INTRODUCTION

    The ever-growing world population and the rapidly approaching

    planetary boundaries have led to widespread discussion and

    consensus on the urgent need for the ﬁeld of agriculture

    to gear toward sustainability-oriented initiatives (Giovannucci

    et al., 2012; Herrero and Thornton, 2013; FAO, 2017; Pretty

    et al., 2018). The objective is to reduce, avoid or redress

    environmental impacts and lessen the intense competition for

    input resources such as land, water, energy, and nutrients caused

    by conventional practices (Garnett et al., 2013; Jägermeyr et al.,

    2016; Kamilaris et al., 2017; Pretty et al., 2018; Calicioglu et al.,

    2019). Consequently, a variety of approaches (e.g., “ecological

    intensiﬁcation,” “agroecological intensiﬁcation,” and “sustainable

    intensiﬁcation”) and technologies (e.g., “Precision Agriculture”)

    promoting transitions to sustainable practices have emerged. We

    argue that all these concepts can be summarized in the following

    common denominator: “a blend of technological, social, and

    institutional innovations at diﬀerent scales around a common

    agricultural asset, resource, or subsystem represents a pivot to

    underpin sustainability transitions in agriculture.”

    Sustainability

    transitions

    is

    a

    social

    and

    technical

    (sociotechnical) concept deﬁned as a set of “long-term, multi-

    dimensional, and fundamental transformation processes through

    which [well]-established [organizations] shift to more sustainable

    modes of production and consumption” (Markard et al., 2012).

    This deﬁnition implies that the application of the concept in

    agriculture presents some serious challenges. A ﬁrst challenge

    is the need for a genuine participation and interaction of

    both established and innovative stakeholders or organizations.

    Second, within and between (established) organizations, the

    interactions/relations between individuals and (agricultural)

    technologies and tools existing at a certain level often diﬀer

    considerably from those employed at other levels. In other

    words, established stakeholders and organizations are often

    sociotechnically stratiﬁed (Abbott, 1999; Ingram, 2015). Third,

    the identiﬁcation and contribution of all other concerned

    stakeholders are required to ensure that both social and

    non-social expectations are met (Cunge and Erlich, 1999;

    Rousseau et al., 2005; Abbott and Vojinovic, 2010a,b, 2014).

    Last but not least, it is a multi-disciplinary exercise involving

    a comprehensive knowledge of the diﬀerent subsystems and

    subdomains in agriculture (Killham, 2011; Zomorodian et al.,

    2018; Al-Jawad et al., 2019). This challenge, in turn, leads to the

    ﬁrst challenge mentioned above. Thus, the implementation of the

    sustainability transitions concept in agriculture can be thought

    as a continuous, and even iterative and circular, process of

    engaging all concerned stakeholders around the same common

    agricultural asset, resource, or subsystem discussed above.

    Water is a unique agricultural input that connects, is aﬀected

    by (quantitatively and qualitatively) and aﬀects all agricultural

    subsystems (Zhu et al., 2019). Its use and management are often

    inﬂuenced by a mix of highly complex economic, engineering,

    social, hydrologic, environmental, and even political factors

    (Zomorodian et al., 2018; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019). These

    inﬂuences are expected to become more challenging to cope with

    in light of the anticipated increase in agricultural water demand

    due to climate change impacts and global population growth.

    Furthermore, the conﬂicting behavior, preferences, and goals

    of water stakeholders further complicate the management of

    available water resources (Walker et al., 2015; Zomorodian et al.,

    2018). However, despite the challenges imposed by the water

    stakeholders ecosystem, roughly half of the total agricultural

    water use is lost somewhere between the point of abstraction and

    the crop, and thus, not eﬀectively used (Knox et al., 2012). In

    this same vein, water scarcity, rather than a lack of arable land,

    will be the major constraint to increase agricultural production

    over the next few decades (Watkins, 2006; Hanjra and Qureshi,

    2010). Therefore, water represents the abovementioned common

    agricultural asset/resource to underpin agricultural sustainability

    transitions. It is unarguably the most critical resource to achieve

    sustainable agriculture (Chartzoulakis and Bertaki, 2015).

    Sustainable agriculture is often seen as an umbrella term for

    knowledge-intensive systems that require, beyond the application

    of domain knowledge, a new kind of knowledge (El Bilali

    and Allahyari, 2018). This latter is the knowledge of how

    to apply domain knowledge in new or unprecedented ways,

    i.e., a metaknowledge. In a context of using water resources

    as pivot to achieve agricultural sustainability, the common

    denominator we identiﬁed above, this metaknowledge is known

    as Hydroinformatics (Abbott, 1999). This discipline has emerged

    to deliver unprecedented results in situations where stakeholders

    engagement/mobilization around water resources planning and

    management are most needed, and environmental stakes are

    high. A landmark example of the signiﬁcance of this discipline

    in mobilizing stakeholders is the social breakthrough achieved

    by applying hydroinformatics tools from design to ﬁnish of the

    bridge and tunnel connection between Denmark and Sweden

    (the Oresund Project; Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001). In this

    project, hydroinformatics, through the use of technologies

    of persuasion to communicate complex decision problems,

    was signiﬁcantly successful in adequately informing politicians,

    responsible authorities, and ordinary citizens about the project,

    empowering, and persuading them as well to act as trusted

    stakeholders. Another related example has been introduced

    by Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev (2014) to demonstrate the

    practical application of hydroinformatics in supporting the

    implementation of the concept of “Integrated Water Resources

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    Management” (IWRM; GWP, 2000; Furlong et al., 2015) across

    diverse institutional settings in Central Asia.

    Several eﬃciency-based techniques and approaches aligned

    with the knowledge management function and the sociotechnical

    dimension

    of

    hydroinformatics

    have been

    proposed

    and

    applied to address the problem of agricultural water resources

    sustainability. These include: the IWRM concept (GWP, 2000;

    Furlong et al., 2015); the conjunctive use of surface water

    and groundwater resources (Singh, 2014); novel irrigation

    management systems (Sandler et al., 2004; Evans and Sadler,

    2008; Gumiere et al., 2014; Pelletier et al., 2015; Vanderleest

    et al., 2016; Caron et al., 2017; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019);

    and minimization of food waste and losses (Kummu et al.,

    2012; Pretty et al., 2018; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019; among

    others). An eﬃciency-promoting paradigm with a focus on water

    management includes Precision Irrigation (PI; Perea et al., 2018)

    for crops and aquaculture, and Precision Livestock Farming

    (PLF) for dairy, egg, and meat production (Fournel et al., 2017).

    PI and PLF have emerged to make intensive use of information

    and communication technologies for spatio-temporal data

    collection

    and

    processing

    in

    support

    of

    improved

    farm

    productivity, and cost-eﬀectiveness, sustainability of operations

    and environmental quality. They entail that farms (livestock,

    crops, aquaculture, etc.) are continuously monitored, and the

    collected data mined using integrated modeling approaches

    (e.g., water application models, biophysical simulation models,

    and empirical models) to make decisions and ensure favorable

    production conditions (Fournel et al., 2017; Perea et al., 2018).

    Using water resources as a pivot, these knowledge-intensive

    techniques represent an application for the data-mining-for-

    knowledge-discovery line of development of hydroinformatics

    (Abbott, 1999). Thus, with its (meta)knowledge-producing and

    management function, hydroinformatics represents a viable

    path forward to achieve smart, i.e., sustainable agriculture

    (Allahyari, 2009).

    Although water resources productivity or eﬃciency represents

    a cornerstone to achieve agricultural sustainability, it is not

    a panacea (Wichelns, 2014; Pretty et al., 2018). In this

    regard, substitution-based approaches consisting mainly of

    changes in consumption behaviors have been proposed (van

    Huis and Oonincx, 2017; Pretty et al., 2018; Bjornlund and

    Bjornlund, 2019). These approaches require the application of

    the technologies of persuasion, a subset of hydroinformatics’

    technologies, to change individuals’ inner world and achieve

    behavioral changes (Abbott, 1999; Thorkilsen and Dynesen,

    2001). This suggests that the inherent quantitative way of

    working of hydroinformatics must be complemented by its

    qualitative way of working (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017).

    Thereby, hydroinformatics represents a prospective enabler of

    stakeholders engagement to achieve sustainable agriculture. It

    is exactly this persuasive knowledge-management purpose that

    Abbott (1999) had anticipated, and hence, must be fulﬁlled

    by hydroinformatics in order to realize its full sociotechnical

    potential, particularly in sustainable agriculture (DiSalvo et al.,

    2010; El Bilali and Allahyari, 2018).

    This non-exhaustive overview of the interplay between

    agriculture and hydroinformatics highlights the anticipated

    role and relevance of the discipline proposed herein. This

    paper, thus, introduces agricultural hydroinformatics as a new

    interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research. In addition, it proposes

    a general conceptual framework taking into account the

    distinctive features associated with the sociotechnical dimension

    of hydroinformatics when applied in agriculture. It exempliﬁes

    the quantitative and qualitative interdependencies necessary

    to support the development of sociotechnical environments

    in which hydroinformatics-enabling social “transmutations”

    necessary to achieve agricultural sustainability can be catalyzed. It

    underlies the social and technical “threads” to be woven together

    in order to extend from a hydroinformatics of the quantities into

    a hydroinformatics of the qualities (i.e., subjective experiences,

    perceptions; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017), a necessary condition

    to unleash the potential of the application of hydroinformatics

    in agriculture.

    The paper is organized as follows: section 2 is dedicated to

    the deﬁnition and roles of the discipline and provides rationales

    for the proposed framework; section 3 discusses the applicability

    of the framework using examples from agricultural water

    development projects in horticultural farming. The objective

    of this section is not to demonstrate the applicability of the

    framework, but only to propose a blueprint on how to develop

    it; section 4 discusses opportunities and challenges associated

    with the implementation of agricultural hydroinformatics; and

    section 5, before summarizing and concluding, discusses the

    development of new research areas to achieve the full potential

    of this emerging framework.

    2. AGRICULTURAL HYDROINFORMATICS:

    CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK,

    DEFINITIONS, AND ROLES

    Owing to the inevitable and complex interactions between water

    and the agricultural subsystems, hydroinformatics combines,

    coordinates and interplays with several scientiﬁc ﬁelds of study

    and practices when applied in agriculture. This synergy gives

    rise to a multi-purpose conceptual framework that captures the

    wholeness and inter-dependencies necessary to conduct holistic

    agricultural water systems studies and modeling.

    2.1. The Conceptual Framework

    A

    ﬁrst

    factor

    that

    highlights

    the

    synergy

    between

    hydroinformatics and existing disciplines in agriculture is water

    over-extraction for growing purposes (i.e., at the operational

    level), because of its two-faced (beneﬁcial and detrimental)

    impacts. Some implications include, for example: (i) land

    subsidence (Deng et al., 2018) which is a subject of geology;

    (ii) potential loss of livelihoods and ecosystems due to ﬂooding

    risks, water scarcity and, thus, food security which are subjects

    of hydrology, hydraulics, ecology, economics, and sociology; (iii)

    the implementation of water governance institutions along

    with water rights and water conﬂicts resolution which are

    subjects of legal sciences. The resulting impacts and changes

    of these implications often in turn generate new social and

    technical developments that characterize the circular nature of

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    3

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    hydroinformatics in supporting decisions that improve society

    (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Makropoulos and Savi´c, 2019).

    A second factor is water stress at the farm level as it is

    regarded as the greatest abiotic inhibitor of agricultural yield

    (Ciais et al., 2005; Gumiere et al., 2020). Such a factor has

    potentially destructive impacts on plant phenotypes such as

    growth, yield, eﬃciency and resistance (Houle et al., 2010)

    and livestock phenotypes such as feed intake, body mass, and

    milk production (Chedid et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2015).

    Consequently, agricultural hydroinformatics may have a role

    to play in phenomics research (Houle et al., 2010; Furbank

    and Tester, 2011) and potentially in genomics research as well

    (Chaves et al., 2003; Tuberosa and Salvi, 2006). This role may

    be further extended into new gene-based crop and livestock

    models of interactions between genotypes, growth environments,

    and farmers’ management decisions and practices to improve

    farm performance (Antle et al., 2017). Furthermore, water stress

    also inﬂuences the physiology of both plants (e.g., photosynthetic

    activity) and livestock (Osakabe et al., 2014; Fournel et al., 2017).

    Last but not least, pest-management regimes (pest management

    science) and waste management practices in agriculture are known

    to have consequences on water quality with implications on water

    stress (Sims and Wolf, 1994; Larson et al., 1997; Burkholder et al.,

    2006; Zhang et al., 2008).

    The overviewed synergy between ﬁelds of studies and

    practices embodies the sociotechnical nature of the application

    of hydroinformatics in agriculture and, accordingly, it sets

    the basis for the generic conceptual framework depicted in

    Figure 1. Together, the components of the framework exemplify

    the wholeness and inter-dependencies necessary to conduct

    agricultural systems studies and modeling. Such an endeavor

    requires the weaving of the naturalistic perspective (i.e.,

    clearly deﬁned quantities) and the hydro-social perspective

    (subjective/phenomenological in nature) of water resources

    management (Biswas and Dune, 1971; Walker et al., 2015;

    Vojinovic et al., 2016; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Zomorodian

    et al., 2018; Ženko and Menga, 2019). As such, the framework

    accounts for those aspects of water resources management that

    may not at all be expressed in numerical and/or monetary terms

    (Vojinovic and Van Teeﬀelen, 2007; Ten Veldhuis, 2011; Walker

    et al., 2015; Vojinovic et al., 2016). Thus, it exempliﬁes an

    anchor or starting point for extending from the rather narrow

    techno-centric approach of hydroinformatics toward a broader

    hydroinformatics of the qualities (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017).

    In doing so, the potential of hydroinformatics in its scope and

    reach will be unleashed.

    The framework also oﬀers the opportunity to delineate the

    scope of future sociotechnological development for agricultural

    hydroinformatics. In this regard, it can be viewed as: (a) the

    data ﬂows inventory necessary when conducting sustainable

    water resources management in agriculture, and (b) a discipline-

    delineated approach for the engineering of information and

    simulation models development and integration in agriculture.

    These two facets conﬁrm the multi-purpose nature of the

    framework. The framework is amenable to capture, for example,

    the underlying data infrastructure needed to support the Plants

    in silico vision (Zhu et al., 2016), as well as the multi-scale crop

    modeling framework for climate change adaptation assessment

    as proposed by Peng et al. (2020). In these and similar

    contexts, agricultural hydroinformatics is expected to evolve with

    additional links to other ﬁelds of study and the development

    of new classes of tools and technologies. Accordingly, it may

    develop to (a) move the frontiers of the subﬁeld currently known

    as AgInformatics or Agroinformatics (Gupta, 2009; De Montis

    et al., 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017) and (b) carry in its own

    right the sociotechnical implications of agricultural systems,

    an important aspect that is overlooked in the literature on

    agroinformatics (Sørensen et al., 2010; Lokuge et al., 2016; De

    Montis et al., 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017).

    2.2. Deﬁnitions of Agricultural

    Hydroinformatics

    In

    light

    of

    the

    proposed

    framework,

    agricultural

    hydroinformatics

    can

    be

    intrinsically

    deﬁned

    as

    “the

    production and use of knowledge from data ﬂows relevant to

    the understanding and management of water in agriculture,

    together with interactions with, transformation by, and impacts

    on surrounding environments (e.g., plants, soil, animals, people)

    and vice versa”. However, the agriculture sector represents a

    typical example of a technology ecosystem within which several

    technologies interact and inﬂuence one another’s evolution. In

    such an ecosystem, agricultural hydroinformatics as a technology

    itself will interact with other technologies (e.g., farm machinery)

    either directly (e.g., usage and integration of data from agro-

    equipment) or indirectly (e.g., modeling of agro-equipment

    impacts on water). We have identiﬁed many components of the

    ecosystem, often referred to as reverse salient in the literature

    on sociology of technology (Hughes, 1987), that fails to deliver

    an acceptable level of technological capabilities to facilitate

    the integration and evolution of hydroinformatics therein.

    Therefore, we further deﬁne agricultural hydroinformatics

    as “the technology that should identify, support and promote

    corrective measures, and ultimately apply those (if necessary)

    capable of enhancing the performance delivery of the ecosystem of

    technologies as a whole.”

    2.3. Anticipated Roles of Agricultural

    Hydroinformatics

    In

    light

    of

    the

    second

    deﬁnition

    presented

    above,

    hydroinformatics, when integrated in the agricultural technology

    ecosystem, will impose both physical and digital constraints

    on the design, functionalities, characteristics of the ecosystem

    itself and respond to similar constraints that will contribute to

    the whole ecosystem evolution. This suggests that agricultural

    hydroinformatics carries the responsibility to deﬁne what we call,

    using an object-oriented software engineering metaphor, a set of

    role types as part of a role model that describes the functionalities

    of and collaborations between its inner and outer components

    in the technology ecosystem. This metaphor triggers the idea

    that agricultural hydroinformatics will hold an evolutionary

    inﬂuence on the other technologies it interacts with. Therefore,

    using social media parlance, agricultural hydroinformatics is a

    technology inﬂuencer and role model. Overall, it can be regarded

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    FIGURE 1 | Agricultural hydroinformatics and interacting entities as a conceptual
    framework.

    as a blueprint for implementation and adoption of information

    and communication technologies in agriculture.

    Last but not least, agricultural hydroinformatics may play a

    unique role in the deﬁnition of control and response variables

    based on local water systems conditions in support of the

    scientiﬁc roadmap toward the redeﬁnition of the water planetary

    boundary concept as proposed by Gleeson et al. (2020). For

    instance, ﬁve of the six proposed new water planetary sub-

    boundaries (e.g., soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration,

    groundwater) have direct connections with water management

    in agriculture.

    3. APPLICABILITY OF THE PROPOSED

    FRAMEWORK

    The proposed framework embodies a certain degree of generality

    that makes it amenable to transcend both spatial (ﬁeld, farm,

    watershed, regional, national, and global) and temporal (from the

    planning stage to food distribution stage) scales of food modeling

    and production systems. Therefore, it is suitable to be used

    in a wide range of agricultural development situations beyond

    connections between agro-economic and water engineering

    development and its socioeconomic impacts. We have identiﬁed

    at least three preponderant use cases for which the framework

    can be applied to support and guide sustainable agricultural

    development. They are: (i) data and information modeling,

    (ii) agricultural systems simulation and modeling, and (iii)

    engineering of simulation models source codes. We need to

    reiterate that the objective of this section is not to demonstrate

    the applicability of the framework, but only to propose a

    blueprint on how to develop it. However, the applicability will

    be exempliﬁed through the detailed discussion of real-world

    case studies.

    To better guide the discussion, especially on the data and

    information modeling, we must introduce a use case in the

    form of a complex situation where the majority, if not all, the

    components of the framework can be at play simultaneously.

    Such a use case must draw on prior practical situations that

    involve the tasks of water management for various (large-scale)

    purposes and at diﬀerent spatial scales. Similar to the Oresund

    Project discussed before, this project to be selected as an example

    must also involve political and environmental stakeholders.

    Accordingly, it must address concerns, expectations, and

    requirements of a range of both formal and informal groups.

    In addition, it would do more justice to the utility of the

    framework to use at least a project that may have involved

    spatio-temporal sustainability-related simulations to persuade

    stakeholders during the planning stage through the project

    approval process and construction completion phase.

    The Brazilian Rio Sao Francisco transbasin diversion project

    (de Andrade et al., 2011), owing to its unique socioeconomic,

    hydrologic and geologic context, is a particular project that ﬁts

    well the stated criteria. It evolved under strict environmental

    laws; it required socially and environmentally conscious and

    participative stakeholders; it was designed to supply water to

    the most water-scarce area of the country with only 3.3% of

    water resources, but 29% of the national population; and it went

    through a tribulated approval process mostly due to a lack of

    solid technical plans, and public consensus about its potential

    beneﬁts (de Andrade et al., 2011). In addition, agricultural water

    demand accounted for the largest percentage of the total demand

    (Maneta et al., 2009; Roman, 2017). Last but not least, the project

    has attracted the attention of a large community of both national

    and international researchers, making it a highly studied and

    adequately documented case.

    3.1. Data and Information Modeling

    In data and information modeling scenarios, the ﬁrst step is

    to examine which component (s) of the proposed framework

    (Figure 1) is relevant. To determine this, the type of questions

    to be asked is for example: what kind of both quantitative

    and qualitative data or variables should be considered? The

    answer to this question would lead to an inventory of variables

    pertaining to each relevant component of the framework. This

    is the starting point to determine data ﬂows consideration for

    a particular agricultural water management scenario using the

    proposed framework. If we consider the legal sciences component,

    the answer to this question is that the data model may include,

    for example, entities associated with description of laws or legal

    frameworks established to govern or constrain the operation

    and management of water development projects, as well as

    description of water governance institutions.

    We present a preliminary example in Figure 2 with suﬃcient

    details depicting how some of the framework components

    can be used to develop information models for agriculture-

    related water development projects and farm management. We

    acknowledge that the example is non-exhaustive in the sense

    that it does not present a complete data model that includes all

    the components of the framework. This is also not the main

    objective of the paper. Therefore, instead of introducing a whole

    new information model, we tap into the Observations Data

    Model (ODM2; Horsburgh et al., 2016), a water-focused data

    model that has caught the attention of the agricultural research

    community (Janssen et al., 2017). It has been developed as a

    general information model to integrate both in situ sensors data,

    and ex-situ analyses results data, two situations that are common

    in the agriculture domain. It has also been successfully applied

    to four diﬀerent disciplines (hydrology, rock geochemistry, soil

    geochemistry, and biogeochemistry) to meet ﬁeld and laboratory

    data management needs (Hsu et al., 2017; Horsburgh et al., 2019).

    The example data model shows how some of the project

    attributes such as construction costs, distance of transfer and

    annual volume of water transferred (Shumilova et al., 2018) can

    be represented in the envisioned data model. The consideration

    of this simple metadata set is important for several reasons. First

    and foremost, there is no dedicated and maintained database on

    water transfer projects, particularly with irrigation as a purpose

    (Shumilova et al., 2018). Second, one can capitalize on the data

    ﬂows from the proposed framework to include food traceability

    information as part of the data model by linking food chains

    to water supply sources. Thus, the information model can be

    extended to support more accurate and detailed embedded

    or virtual water (D’Odorico et al., 2010; Konar et al., 2011;

    MacDonald et al., 2015) and water footprint (Hoekstra, 2017)

    proﬁles. This is a growingly accepted factor to be accounted for

    in sustainable resource-use decision-making processes (Zipper

    et al., 2020). In addition, the hydraulics component may include

    time series of ﬂow rate and diverted ﬂow rate. Although not

    presented in the example, the data model may contain provision

    to record the characteristics of both the donor and receiving

    basins under the hydraulics component of the framework. A

    many-to-many donor-receiver relationship must be maintained

    as well to enable the ability of a donor basin to supply more

    than one receiver basin and vice versa. The purposes of the

    project (e.g., agriculture, mining, steelworks, domestic supply),

    a determinant factor in assessing economic impacts of water

    development projects (Xiao et al., 2019), may as well be included

    in the data model (e.g., as a controlled-vocabularies-based entity;

    see ConstructionPurposesCV and ProjectDescription entities in

    Figure 2).

    Transboundary water development projects, such as the

    Brazilian Rio Sao Francisco transbasin and the Oresund Project,

    are often signiﬁcant sources of water disputes and legal challenges

    (Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001; de Andrade et al., 2011; De

    Stefano et al., 2017). This suggests the need for the relationship

    shown between the hydraulics and legal sciences components in

    Figure 2. The latter component is presumed to contain mostly

    qualitative variables which are often associated with a set of

    weights or scores to quantify their importance (Vojinovic et al.,

    2016). Therefore, for the purpose of the example, we introduce

    an entity named CausesOfConﬂictCV, an entity to host controlled

    vocabularies describing causes of water conﬂict. A similar score-

    based variable approach was used to develop the Basins at

    Risk (BAR) scale that aims to systematically assess the process

    of international water conﬂict resolution (Wolf et al., 2003).

    Another example is the Water Events Scale (WES; Bernauer et al.,

    2012) depicting the intensity and impact of domestic cooperative

    and conﬂicting water-related events. The BAR and WES scales

    may also be included in the form of controlled vocabularies as

    entities of the legal sciences component.

    Similarly, the hydrology component may contain hydro-

    meteorological variables recorded as time series. To not delve

    into the details of fully documenting hydrological data, we show

    how entities under the hydrology component, i.e., observational

    data derived from both sensors and specimens, can be described

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    FIGURE 2 | Example of data model schema conceptualized based off the agricultural
    hydroinformatics framework and the ODM2 developed by Horsburgh et al.

    (2016). It depicts four components of the proposed framework with related table
    deﬁnitions that may be used in developing a data model. The identiﬁer ﬁeld for
    each

    tuple (row) in the tables ends with the string “ID” with or without the +– symbol.

    and juxtaposed to entities already deﬁned in the ODM2. In

    Figure 2, we show an example of entity (WaterTableDepth)

    that has its additional characteristics deﬁned in the ODM2.

    This extension of our example data model to ODM2 is

    achieved through the ODM2Core.SamplingFeatures entity, used

    to store the physical characteristics of the river basins which

    include spatially referenced data. This juxtaposition requires

    slight modiﬁcations in the ODM2 Core schema, such as the

    elimination of tables such as ODM2Core.Variables and the update

    of others such as the ODM2Core.SamplingFeatures table (see

    rows highlighted in blue in Figure 2) which serves as the point

    of connection.

    Although groundwater is not directly withdrawn in the

    donor basin, for such a large-scale project, subsidence rates

    may be monitored in the donor basin. Accordingly, the geology

    component may be used to record measured subsidence rates

    and geologic characteristics of the donor and receiver basin. The

    description of such a variable would follow the same structure

    deﬁned for the variables under the hydrology component as in

    Figure 2, i.e., the use of variable names as controlled vocabularies

    (e.g., water table depth, land subsidence) for the entity name.

    The sociology component can be modeled as a set of entities

    representing relevant qualitative and quantitative variables.

    There is a systematic gap in the literature on the qualitative

    entities that should be considered. However, we draw from the

    literature on the ﬁeld of socio-hydrology that aims to investigate

    the co-evolution and dynamics of social-water systems (Sivapalan

    et al., 2012). Research work on this subject (Elshafei et al.,

    2014; Kandasamy et al., 2014; van Emmerik et al., 2014; Kotir

    et al., 2016) suggest that the dynamics of the population is

    a quantitative variable that should be included. Therefore, we

    include an entity with attributes relevant to represent this

    phenomenon in Figure 2. The diﬀerent types of social/behavioral

    responses (e.g., contractive, expansive, accommodating) and

    beneﬁts of stakeholders/actors as well as impacts (Biswas and

    Dune, 1971; Abdullaev and Mollinga, 2010; Wheeler et al., 2013;

    Liu et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015; Vojinovic et al., 2016;

    Srinivasan et al., 2017; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Zomorodian

    et al., 2018; Ženko and Menga, 2019) at both the donor

    and receiver basins should be considered. Figure 2 shows an

    entity named BehavioralResponses with parameters describing

    how behavioral responses from each group of actors can be

    7

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    represented in the information model. The responses can be

    further segmented into classes (Neutral, Low, Medium, High)

    according to their level of signiﬁcance or relative importance,

    which can themselves be standardized terms. This entity or the

    sociology component can also be extended to account for changes

    in behavioral responses and interactions through time or adjusted

    to consider the need of the pluralistic water research concept

    (PWR; Evers et al., 2017).

    The discussed model for inter-basin water transfer projects

    may be extended to integrate a farm-level and ﬁeld-level

    data model. Again, the ﬁeld ProjectID can be used to link

    this data model to the example shown in Figure 2. Such a

    model may adapt, mimic, and extend, for example, the ODM2

    discussed above. Depending on the type of farm, the data model

    may contain provision to record farm machinery operation

    information and accordingly may integrate entities for a Farm

    Machinery Management Information System (FMMIS; Fountas

    et al., 2015b). Ultimately, it may be extended to integrate

    components of a Farm Management Information System (FMIS;

    Fountas et al., 2015a). In addition, this data model may also

    contain description to record waste management practices, pest

    management practices, soil properties and water status (soil

    science component) through the ODM extension, phenomic

    data including crop water status (phenomics component) and

    ultimately genomic data (genomics component). For livestock

    farming, Fournel et al. (2017) provide a list of environmental,

    physiological and behavioral variables for farm-level data and

    they fall under the phenomics component and meteorology

    which we assume is part of the hydrology component of the

    proposed framework.

    The current trend in agriculture is toward more complex,

    technologically-enabled farm production systems with increasing

    control and supervision (Lindblom et al., 2017; Wolfert et al.,

    2017; Peng et al., 2020). With the ideas presented in this

    section, we bring forth the vision to treat agricultural production

    as a sociotechnical phenomenon and promote a sociotechnical-

    system approach to data and information models development

    as epitomized by the proposed framework. The discussed data

    model, due to its holistic nature, may be called a Sustainability-

    oriented Agricultural Data Model (SADaM). As highlighted

    above, agricultural hydroinformatics, in its role as a technology

    inﬂuencer, bears the responsibility to build on and adapt existing

    progress and proven best practices in information modeling

    such as the ODM2 to deliver a fully-ﬂedged data model. This

    task constitutes a ﬁrst and foremost step toward building

    a strong foundation for new and more profound changes

    in the agricultural sector. As a consequence, we anticipate

    and discuss below the development of more advanced data

    acquisition systems and tools/middleware enabling direct data

    and metadata streaming to database systems implementing the

    SADaM information model.

    Our attempt to represent qualitative variables as part of

    the information model example in Figure 2 highlights an

    outstanding gap in the literature on socio-hydrology. This is

    the need for the development of a common nomenclature and

    controlled vocabularies to represent qualitative processes such

    as attitudes of stakeholders toward water availability or scarcity.

    Well-known eﬀorts such as the Open Geospatial Consortium

    (OGC), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the

    Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic

    Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI) are of very little or no relevance.

    Nevertheless, Wheeler et al. (2013) lay the groundwork for

    such future research eﬀort on this subject. The development

    of such a data model also involves the need to capture not

    only the semantics of each component, but also the lineage

    relationships between the processes and the resulting outputs as

    part of the metadata development processes. This may ultimately

    lead to a specialized ontology integrating the elements and

    relationships in the proposed framework. This eﬀort may build

    on prior ontology-development eﬀort as this practice has been

    promoted and is widely implemented by the hydroinformatics

    community (Abbott, 1999; Islam and Piasecki, 2006; Beran and

    Piasecki, 2009; Garrido et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Brodaric and

    Hahmann, 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Brodaric et al., 2016).

    3.2. Agricultural Systems Simulations

    Models Development

    We have discussed how the proposed framework can be

    applied to develop linked data models through a discipline-

    delineated entities approach whereby variables are arranged

    under their corresponding component of the framework. The

    same approach can be adopted to architect agricultural systems

    simulation models. The ﬁrst step is to identify the target

    processes to be simulated. These can be crop yields, water

    use, or demand and evapotranspiration rate. The second step

    is then to identify the relevant variables (raw or processed

    data) and new or existing models that output the relevant

    variables (data products) for the identiﬁed target processes. For

    example, the simulation of crop water demands (hydraulics

    component) requires a model (hydrology component) to estimate

    the potential evapotranspiration rate (data product). A more

    complex example can be the simulation of crop growth

    (phenomics component) response to water and nutrients. This

    requires a water budget model (hydrology component), nutrients

    budget model (soil science component), nutrients transport

    model (soil science component), inﬁltration and runoﬀ models

    (hydrology component).

    The identiﬁed models fall under a certain component (e.g.,

    hydrology) but are able to pull data (raw, processed, aggregated,

    model results) from any component with the relevant data. Thus,

    simulation models of various complexity level can be built on

    top of and tap into a database that implements the data model

    discussed above. In such a data system and simulation model

    conﬁguration, the new model results can be saved back to the

    data system with its provenance information (e.g., Rousseau et al.,

    2000). We present in Figure 3 the four-layer skeleton of such a

    system in the form of a multi-layer Artiﬁcial Neural Networks

    architecture for knowledge workﬂows engineering. It shows the

    relationships between: (a) ﬁrst layer: raw data (e.g., temperature

    from sensors), (b) second layer: processed data from the previous

    layer (e.g., minimum and maximum daily temperatures), (c)

    third layer: simple models (e.g., evapotranspiration) that use data

    from either of the ﬁrst two layers or from both of them, and

    8

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    (d) fourth layer: complex physical models (e.g., Hydrus; Simunek

    et al., 1999; AquaCrop; Vanuytrecht et al., 2014; AquaCrop open-

    source version; Foster et al., 2017) that, for example, suggest the

    amount of water to apply for irrigation or quantify crop yield

    response to water. This last layer may also include data-driven

    models (e.g., machine learning models) similar to the example

    reported by Gumiere et al. (2020) and can pull data from any

    combination of the three layers on top.

    The versatility of the framework confers to agricultural

    hydroinformatics the ability to promote sustainability through

    water management-centric practices. These practices are in

    turn supported by a sociotechnical-system approach built on

    information and simulation models. We, therefore, envision

    an agricultural simulation system or environment that boosts

    reproducibility of research through systematic and formal

    records of the relationships among raw data, the processes that

    produce results and the results themselves as highlighted by

    Pasquier et al. (2017). This feature of the framework makes

    it particularly well-suited to support the delivery of integrated

    modeling structures for complex agricultural systems using, for

    example, the system dynamics method (e.g., see Berthiaume et al.,

    2005). This method has gained grounds in a broad spectrum

    of applications, primarily when water resources and agricultural

    production systems sustainability objectives are pursued (Walters

    et al., 2016; Zomorodian et al., 2018). It subdivides a system

    into an interconnected series of ﬂows (inputs and outputs) and

    stocks (reservoirs) aﬀecting one another through a feedback

    mechanism, thereby providing decision-makers with possible

    consequences of system perturbations (Zomorodian et al., 2018).

    A preliminary example of the application of the system dynamics

    approach to simulate agricultural production systems (crop and

    livestock) sustainability by Walters et al. (2016) demonstrates

    that ﬁve (5) clusters of ﬂows and stocks (Economics, Crop

    Production, Livestock Production, Environmental Quality, and

    Social Quality) are reﬂected in our proposed framework.

    3.3. Simulation Models Source Codes

    Engineering

    The framework brings forth the ability to guide the engineering

    of simulation models source codes. In line with the new

    architecture of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology

    Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model presented in Jones

    et al. (2003), the framework imposes a modular structure in

    which components separate along scientiﬁc discipline lines;

    it is structured to allow easy replacement or addition of

    components or sub-components, and enable greater cooperation

    in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge

    to solve problems at all levels. In addition, it promotes the

    granularity of simulation models development by supporting

    the generation of source codes incrementally through the

    combination of atomically-deﬁned model algorithm blocks. A

    block can be developed to comply with the Single Responsibility

    Principle or Separation of Concerns of software engineering

    (Martin, 2002) and thus, is responsible for a single task (e.g.,

    computation of hourly averages). An anticipated beneﬁt is that

    a block of source codes responsible to compute a speciﬁc data

    product within or for a model can be developed under one

    component of the framework and reused under any other

    component of the framework. Thus, from a software engineering

    point of view, a block of codes may be designed to serve as a single

    channel to output a speciﬁc time series from the database or data

    product from a model to any component or any model within a

    component of the framework.

    4. OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

    FOR AGRICULTURAL

    HYDROINFORMATICS

    Although the agricultural domain is well-stratiﬁed with its

    techniques and approaches for knowledge generation and

    consumption, we anticipate that hydroinformatics will ﬁnd

    many not-currently-apparent opportunities to underpin social,

    institutional, and technological innovations around water

    resources management toward agricultural sustainability. We

    anticipate that more opportunities will occur when, for example,

    the agricultural hydroinformaticist explores the business and

    phenomenological dimensions of hydroinformatics. In line with

    this “entrepreneurial” endeavor, Kamilaris et al. (2017) call for

    the creation of radically new services to promote, for example,

    the practices and beneﬁts of (big) data collection and analysis in

    agriculture. Next, we highlight opportunities and challenges to

    accelerate social and technological transformations through the

    application of hydroinformatics in agriculture.

    4.1. High-Performance Data Acquisition

    Systems Development

    The complexity of a data management system that implements

    the information model discussed here will evidently require more

    automation and capabilities from data acquisition systems. In

    this regard, a best practice we have learned through experience

    is that the development in data acquisition systems must take

    place after the data management planning phase. This constitutes

    the main reason why we introduce the discussion on data and

    information modeling ﬁrst. The primary rationale for such order

    is that when data acquisition devices/systems are designed and

    developed with no consideration of the (digital) constraints

    imposed by a data management system that prioritizes data

    standardization, they tend to obey what we may call the “data

    logging rules or philosophy.” This implies that the devices or data

    acquisition systems (i.e., current dataloggers and sensors) simply

    collect and operate on data values. In other words, they have no

    formal support for metadata annotations, a critically important

    feature to reduce the manual data-to-metadata-mapping eﬀort

    on data managers (when data standardization is adopted) and

    increase the useability and value of the data. Furthermore, the

    conﬁguration process (e.g., programming) of those devices often

    allows the user or operator to inﬂuence the data production

    process. This inﬂuence occurs through tasks that are as simple as

    allowing the operator to set names for variables being measured.

    This is an outlet for all three types of heterogeneities (schematic,

    semantic, syntactic) in the collected data. As pointed out by

    Kruize et al. (2013), it usually results in substantial manual

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    9

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    FIGURE 3 | Architecture of the envisioned knowledge workﬂow management of agricultural
    hydroinformatics.

    and cognitive eﬀorts to preprocess and harmonize the collected

    data. In addition, it becomes more complicated to annotate the

    data with corresponding metadata. These shortcomings are also

    present in data acquisition systems used in the agricultural sector.

    A review of the literature reveals that current (farms) ﬁeld

    data acquisition systems are not designed to be, and thus, are

    not considered as an integral part of FMISs (see Nikkilä et al.,

    2010; Kaloxylos et al., 2012; Kruize et al., 2013; Zia et al., 2013;

    Fountas et al., 2015a; López-Riquelme et al., 2017; Paraforos

    et al., 2017; for examples of FMIS building blocks). Such a

    technical deﬁciency or schism may explain why data acquisition

    and management, for on-farm decision support, research and

    policy decision-making purposes, is recognized as the most

    pressing limitations of agricultural systems models (Capalbo

    et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2017). In the context of precision

    agriculture, which is a growingly accepted practice to achieve

    sustainability, these limitations are mainly attributed to the

    heterogeneities of the collected and available datasets (Nikkilä

    et al., 2010; Wolfert et al., 2017). Two widely cited reasons are

    that the data ﬂows involved originate from various instruments

    and technologies (Fournel et al., 2017; El Bilali and Allahyari,

    2018), and from several (sub)disciplines and sources (Capalbo

    et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2017). Therefore, the development

    of more advanced technologies for data acquisition that resolve

    schematic, semantic and syntactic heterogeneities is another area

    wherein the impacts of hydroinformatics is most needed. The

    hydroinformatics community has made signiﬁcant development

    in this area with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT)

    paradigm, low-cost, and open-source software and hardware

    (e.g., Wong and Kerkez, 2016; Horsburgh et al., 2019). Although

    in some hydroinformatics case studies, the devices automatically

    ingest the collected data to a standardized data management

    system, they still adopt the data logging philosophy, reveling an

    opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to introduce some

    new technologies using new approaches. Below, we introduced

    characteristics of potential data acquisition systems that are more

    suitable to close existing gaps toward a more integrated farm

    sensing and FMIS.

    A potential innovative solution that could get at least three

    birds with one stone is a new generation (second generation with

    respect to data loggers) of sensing systems for both point-based

    and spatial monitoring designed to be deployed in the ﬁeld with

    a (minimum) knowledge base of the object being monitored, in

    addition to user-deﬁned deployment-context metadata. Celicourt

    et al. (2020) have created a preliminary prototype of such

    system mainly to cope with the data management issues

    previously mentioned. An immediate and ﬁrst beneﬁt is that

    the devices (for point-based and geospatial observations) could

    work autonomously and in synergy to make decisions in the

    ﬁeld. Second, they can themselves be programmed or conﬁgured

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    10

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    to automatically create new metadata and/or derive metadata

    from original deployment-context metadata and document the

    decisions made. Subsequently, the documented decision along

    with farm ﬁeld statuses may ultimately be submitted via some

    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the backend of

    a cyberinfrastructure. Third, the devices may be also designed

    to output human and machine-readable data in standardized

    formats such as WaterML (Almoradie et al., 2013).

    A prototype of this second generation of data acquisition

    system may simply consist in a Soil Matric Tension (SMT) sensor

    along with other relevant sensors attached to a microcomputer

    (e.g., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black) or microcontroller (e.g.,

    Arduino), but with onboard deployment-context information as

    highlighted in the aforementioned ODM version 2.0 example, in

    addition to farm characteristics. The knowledge base can contain

    information that is as minimal as the root zone tension range

    of −4 to −7.5 kPa and water table depth range of 500–600 mm

    (Vanderleest et al., 2016) for cranberry productivity optimization,

    for example. In situations where an irrigation event occurs in

    a speciﬁc ﬁeld, the data acquisition system can be programmed

    to automatically generate the data and metadata necessary (e.g.,

    water volume, duration, soil matric potential, weather conditions,

    ﬁeld or bed identiﬁer, etc.) to document such event according

    to a relevant agri-food standard. The ﬁle may be downloaded

    on-site, or the content can be encoded and transmitted to a

    web server where it is accessible to a FMIS. This latter may, in

    turn, formats and shares the received information using the same

    standard format.

    This generation of sensing devices (front-end) can be

    integrated in a feedback loop with crops and livestock models

    (backend of a cyberinfrastructure) to assess the inevitable gap

    between experimental results and ﬁeld implementation and

    take on-the-ﬂy corrective measures. Thorkilsen and Dynesen

    (2001) implemented a feedback monitoring programme with a

    similar mechanism in the context of the aforementioned Oresund

    project which was quite eﬀective in ensuring the fulﬁllment of

    environmental objectives and design criteria during and after the

    project construction phase.

    A third and more futuristic generation of farm monitoring

    systems include those based on artiﬁcial intelligence techniques

    (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) along with

    other relevant techniques to automatically determine relevant

    information about the farm ﬁelds (e.g., geospatial extent, type

    of crop, growth stage, crop statuses) being monitored. Contrary

    to the second generation previously mentioned, this one would

    be capable of generating nearly all of the necessary metadata

    (auto-generated metadata) needed to document the collected

    information including geographic positions of the sensors or

    all components of overall sensing system. Such a system would

    require a new kind of “built-in” metadata that is relevant to help,

    in a ﬁrst stage, the interpretation of the auto-generated metadata,

    and in a second stage, the collected data.

    As an example, such a third-generation ﬁeld-data acquisition

    system may consist of a SMT sensor that automatically reports

    its deployment depth (e.g., 250 mm) as a piece of metadata.

    This SMT sensor may rely on either a patched depth sensor

    (assuming in prototyping stage) or an integrated one (e.g., using

    Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation (RFID) technology) that behaves

    as multi-parameter sensor. In this situation, the depth sensor has

    its own, preferably built-in, metadata (e.g., accuracy, variable,

    unit, etc.) that describes the depth measurement for the SMT

    sensor. The SMT sensor also has a similar set of, preferably

    built-in, metadata. In this example, the interpretation of the

    SMT sensor data involves the knowledge of: (a) the sensor

    metadata itself, (b) the auto-generated metadata by the depth

    sensor and (c) the metadata of the depth sensor. This last set

    of metadata is a new kind of data that bears the potential to

    help in understanding the ﬁrst two sets (a, b) of metadata and

    is, therefore, a “meta-metadata” or “super-metadata” or “root

    metadata.” The SMT sensor may be further retroﬁtted with a

    GPS device and an accelerometer to automatically report its

    deployment position (latitude, longitude, and/or altitude). This

    would further simplify the metadata provision process and allows

    automatic management (commissioning and decommissioning)

    of the sensor. In this case, the characteristics of the GPS

    device and accelerometer would serve as additional super-

    metadata for the SMT sensor. Although the hydroinformatics

    community has not dealt with the management of this new

    kind of metadata before, the experiences developed therein in

    terms of metadata management and ontology development may

    guide the path forward, as this concept is applied to data and

    information modeling.

    The ideas presented above set agricultural hydroinformatics

    in a position to help address the major lag time in systems to

    exploit new advances in data, information and communication

    technology (Berger and Hovav, 2013; Fountas et al., 2015a; Antle

    et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2017). Consequently, recent eﬀorts to

    improve and accelerate the rate of agricultural innovation and

    meeting the growing global need for food and ﬁber have been

    limited by the need for improved data, models and knowledge

    products (Fountas et al., 2015a; Capalbo et al., 2017; Jones et al.,

    2017). The ideas presented here as possible pathways for new

    sensing systems for farm monitoring are intended to alleviate the

    usability problems and the requirements for farmers to manually

    input data that they are not familiar with. These two obstacles are

    identiﬁed as important limiting factors to the adoption of FMIS

    (Alvarez and Nuthall, 2006; Nikkilä et al., 2010; Kruize et al.,

    2013).

    4.2. Novel Approaches to Simulation

    Models Development and Integration

    A common limitation of most crop and environmental models

    is that the model is distributed solely as a compiled software

    package (Foster et al., 2017). Furthermore, Jones et al. (2017)

    acknowledge that major advances are needed to achieve the

    next generation of simulation models that move beyond the

    inclusion of economic and sustainability issues to meet, for

    example, the agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

    In line with this vision, our proposed framework promotes

    the level of ﬂexibility in terms of modeling approach, models

    implementation and modularity, types of models, and models-

    integration extent needed to tackle the complexity of agricultural

    systems modeling. To this end, the development of open

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    web-based computational infrastructures or tools ecosystems

    that support the creation of models source codes through

    the combination of atomically-deﬁned models components or

    subsystems components may be handy. To facilitate model

    integration, such a tool ecosystem may be designed to

    automatically encapsulate the generated source codes for each

    model within the structure of a chosen modeling framework (e.g.,

    OpenMI; Gregersen et al., 2007). Although the implementation

    process can be quite a complex task to achieve a resulting

    set of coupled models that is as simple as the prescriptive

    sociohydrology framework presented by Elshafei et al. (2014), it

    would be instrumental in delivering truly reusable, modular and

    highly granular models. Such an infrastructure bears the potential

    to be transformed into a new kind of decision-support system

    which is that of the creation of integrated agricultural models and

    even DSS, thus a meta-DSS. Last but not least, it may be further

    extended to enable the generation of the resulting models in

    diﬀerent programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C, C++, Python)

    using the Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) concept (Noonan, 1985).

    This is another opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to

    play its role of a technology inﬂuencer.

    4.3. Innovative Technologies Adoption

    We have hitherto identiﬁed a number of avenues to overcome

    challenges pertaining mostly to improvement in agricultural

    data quality and management along with model implementation

    and a new kind of DSS to facilitate models integration.

    However, these challenges represent quite a narrow view of

    the challenges ecosystem to achieve agricultural sustainability

    and meet future demands for food and ﬁber. Here, we aim

    to move the horizon a little further to include those related

    to innovations adoption with a focus on precision agriculture,

    which is our paradigm of interest. Adoption challenges are

    preponderant as they represent serious barriers toward practical

    applications, improvement, adaptation, and maturation of

    innovations to empower farmers of all classes as genuine

    stakeholders. The objective is on-farm inputs optimization to

    achieve lower food production costs and food prices, higher

    inputs productivity, environmental sustainability, food security,

    and safety.

    Despite the experienced and potential beneﬁts of precision

    agricultural technologies (PATs), including proﬁtability and

    productivity (Capalbo et al., 2017; Griﬃn et al., 2017; El Bilali

    and Allahyari, 2018), their adoption is still limited in farming

    practice. This can be seen as a particular case of the more general

    problems of adoption and diﬀusion of new technologies or

    products that also occur outside the agricultural domain studied

    by Moore (1991) as the chasm theory. In the agriculture domain,

    a major impediment to adoption is the lack of technology delivery

    mechanism (Zhang et al., 2002) that often hinders the perceived

    beneﬁts and usability to justify upfront investments in new

    technologies. This stumbling factor is often attributed to the

    implementation problem of FMISs incorporating support for

    farm managers to implement decisions (McCown, 2002; Rossi

    et al., 2014; Lindblom et al., 2017). They fail to capture the “tacit”

    knowledge and practical needs of farmers and are, therefore, not

    adapted to the trade-oﬀs and high complexity that characterize

    farmers’ decision making processes (Lindblom et al., 2017).

    This results in what McCown et al. (2009) called the relevance

    gap, a discrepancy between scientiﬁc knowledge implemented

    in agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS) and practical

    needs and experience-based knowledge of farmers.

    The relevance gap indicates that the sociotechnological nature

    of AgriDSS has not been (adequately) captured over the last 30

    years of research and development (Lindblom et al., 2017). It

    is also supporting the evidence that the transformation in the

    role of farmers, agricultural technologists, and scientists from

    knowers to consumers of knowledge, whereby the latter becomes

    a kind of product to be consumed through socioinstitutional

    arrangements, has yet to occur. Such a transformation has

    been instrumental to the success of hydroinformatics as it

    is applied to water systems (Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001;

    Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev, 2014) and it is now an essential

    aspect of the discipline (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017). It is

    also a precondition for agriculture to enter the postmodern era

    and for agricultural hydroinformatics to become a postmodern

    technology that transforms farmers’ behaviors toward water

    management practices in particular and agricultural production

    practices in general.

    The relevance gap is driving a growing interest in the adoption

    of sociotechnical approaches to agricultural technologies in

    general and (big) data management and DSS development

    in particular by integrating stakeholders in the development

    process (Rossi et al., 2014; Fountas et al., 2015a; Janssen et al.,

    2017; Jones et al., 2017; Lundström and Lindblom, 2018; Rose

    et al., 2018a,b; Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Jakku et al., 2019; Rupnik

    et al., 2019). Such approaches are implemented through a

    number of so-called sustainability theoretical and conceptual

    frameworks that include the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP),

    the social practice theory discussed by Jakku et al. (2019) and

    the Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) approach introduced

    by Kilelu et al. (2013). However, the eﬀorts appear to be at an

    infancy stage. Nevertheless, this convergence in development

    approaches toward what we can call the hydroinformatics

    ways of working further justify its relevance to agriculture. It

    presents an opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to

    promote and accelerate the adoption of existing and future

    technologies in agriculture to deliver better decisions. That

    is the kind of situation therein Abbott and Jonoski (2001)

    anticipated hydroinformatics could play a vital role in producing

    and consuming conjunctive (social and technical) knowledge

    that relates water-dependent soil-cultural practices and plant

    cultivation practices in new ways to promote justiﬁable

    productivity. To this end, they have proposed a three-part

    conceptual framework representing a generic hydroinformatics

    knowledge self-management system for knowledge-intensive

    applications such as precision agriculture and aquaculture,

    health

    care

    services.

    view

    of

    future Farm Management Systems shares some similarities

    with the proposed system. However, Abbott and Jonoski

    (2001) acknowledge that the realization of a corresponding

    prototype represents the greatest sociotechnical challenge of

    hydroinformatics due to socioinstitutional arrangements it

    may require.

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    The current trend toward the conceptualization of water

    systems as cyber-physical infrastructures (Makropoulos and

    Savi´c, 2019) is another convergence point between ongoing

    developments on water systems management and (precision)

    agriculture. This concept oﬀers the opportunity to develop an

    integrated data infrastructure and drive real-time operational

    decisions along with predictive capabilities to improve farm-level

    management and water systems operations (Wolfert et al., 2014,

    2017; Capalbo et al., 2017). However, the volume and variety

    of data involved in precision agriculture, acceptedly named

    “big data,” are far more complex than those in water systems.

    Cyber-physical conﬁgurations enabled by the IoT paradigm

    and Cloud Computing technologies hold an opportunity to

    transform the entire food supply chain into smart webs of

    connected, context-sensitive, uniquely-identiﬁable, remotely-

    controlled things that are context-sensitive and can be identiﬁed

    and controlled remotely (Wolfert et al., 2014). Furthermore, these

    conﬁgurations can be viewed as an extension of either of the two

    generations of data acquisition systems proposed above. They

    set the stage for a more advanced farm management technology

    ecosystem enabling end-to-end support for the FAIR (Findable,

    Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles (Wilkinson

    et al., 2016) and also the implementation of the Digital Twin

    concept (Ding et al., 2019).

    The practical implementation or, at the very least, a prototype

    of these conﬁgurations is indeed challenging (Wolfert et al.,

    2014, 2017), but a lean and agile prototyping approach can shed

    enough light to move the development forward while opening

    up pathways to many opportunities. From a technical point of

    view, implementations with a focus on “big data” management

    may play a preponderant role in engineering the aforementioned

    whole-system data model (SADaM) as the “big data” paradigm

    hauls a growing emphasis on metadata for data provenance

    (Janssen et al., 2017; Wolfert et al., 2017; Coble et al., 2018).

    From a socioinstitutional point of view, the adoption of the “big

    data” approach will certainly highlight factors and conditions

    that may inﬂuence the uptake of these new approaches to farm

    management. The complexity of repatriating and processing

    large private and public datasets is perceived as a possible cause

    of the deceiving adoption of precision agriculture technologies

    (Lawes and Robertson, 2011). In this regard, Wolfert et al.

    (2017) noticed signiﬁcant shifts in roles and power relations

    among diﬀerent players composing the agricultural “big data”

    landscape. But, this landscape, as described, does not hitherto

    contain any knowledge provider in the “hydroinformatics”

    sense as deﬁned by Abbott and Jonoski (2001), Abbott and

    Vojinovic (2010a). Nevertheless, owing to the entwined nature

    of knowledge and power, we anticipate the growing dynamics

    in those power relations will mutate into the Michel Foucault’s

    problematics of “power/knowledge” structures. Fortunately, the

    three-part conceptual framework by Abbott and Jonoski (2001),

    discussed earlier on, has been proposed to speciﬁcally invert these

    structures through an inversion in knowledge relations. Realizing

    a smoothly-working prototype of this proposed example will

    certainly bring around many business opportunities which is

    a basic tenet of hydroinformatics (Abbott, 1999; Abbott and

    Jonoski, 2001).

    Beyond the relevance gap, a speciﬁc, but determinant,

    component of stakeholders engagement that remains a serious

    stumbling factor to the theoretical and conceptual frameworks

    mentioned above when applied in agri-food sustainability

    transitions is the penetration of innovative knowledge into the

    mainstream agricultural regime (Ingram, 2015). For instance, the

    most prominent transition framework applied on agricultural

    sociotechnical

    transitions,

    namely

    Multi-Level

    Perspective

    (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2010), suﬀers from a variety of

    inadequacies highlighted in Hassink et al. (2018) and Ingram

    (2015). Consequently, it is increasingly being complemented

    with other frameworks focusing on human-related and social

    factors (El Bilali, 2018) which is a symptom of the inaptitude

    of the broad range of existing frameworks to eﬀectively tackle

    agricultural sustainability transitions. From a hydroinformatics

    stand-point, we are tempted to consider this strong resistance of

    mainstream agricultural regime to niche knowledge as a situation

    embodying

    the

    same

    problematics

    of

    “power/knowledge”

    mentioned above. Accordingly, for having overcome resistance

    in organizations strongly stratiﬁed (again, in the sociotechnical

    sense) as highlighted with two examples in the introduction,

    hydroinformatics is in a unique position to “crack” mainstream

    agricultural regime strata, by analogy to the hydraulic fracturing

    technique for natural gas extraction. In this regard, Abbott

    (1999) suggested that the problem be tackled through (and

    we quote) “the provision of knowledge to very many persons

    over electronic networks [sociotechnical environments], and

    [more importantly, the provision] of capabilities for people to

    express their fears, concerns and aspirations over these same

    networks, and thence to interact and organize themselves.” Thus,

    this is a further opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics

    to play an underpinning role in facilitating the creation of

    sociotechnical environments in which the transformations or

    transitions necessary to achieve sustainable agricultural systems

    can be catalyzed.

    4.4. Streamlined Agricultural Knowledge

    Management Workﬂows

    The data heterogeneity problem in data sources discussed above

    has led to a number of scattered standards development eﬀorts,

    including data management standards and data vocabularies

    (White et al., 2013), ﬁeld devices communication (e.g., CANbus,

    ModBus; Suprem et al., 2013; Ojha et al., 2015), and thesaurus-

    and ontology-based developments (Janssen et al., 2017; Kamilaris

    et al., 2017). However, a superﬁcial examination of some of them

    reveals that they suﬀer from several shortcomings, including

    incompleteness and inadequate description of variable names

    (e.g., use of abbreviations) and physical units which increases the

    mental workload necessary to work with them.

    Data heterogeneity resolution at the cyber-infrastructure level

    is a particular area wherein the hydroinformatics community

    has made signiﬁcant practical advances (Horsburgh et al., 2008,

    2016; Beran and Piasecki, 2009; Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev,

    2014). A major example is the CUAHSI’s Hydrologic Information

    System (HIS), developed as a cyberinfrastructure to support the

    management and dissemination of ﬁxed-point ﬁeld observations

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    13

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    (Horsburgh et al., 2008). The system has seen widespread

    adoption in enabling the interoperability of observations

    through the development and standardized use of the ODM

    discussed above. Thus, data heterogeneity resolution at both

    the instrumentation and cyber-infrastructure levels represents

    the last piece of the opportunities puzzle for hydroinformatics

    to fully play its role of a technology inﬂuencer. In this context,

    agricultural hydroinformatics is a prime candidate to develop

    fully streamlined agricultural knowledge management workﬂows

    that adhere to the architecture presented in Figure 3. Such an

    architecture represents an instance of the anticipated knowledge

    chain concept in the form of a set of linked steps by which

    data are processed into information, knowledge and ﬁnally

    wisdom as used in decision-making processes discussed by

    Janssen et al. (2017).

    We highlight that special attention needs to be paid to the

    treatment of the units in knowledge management workﬂows,

    which may further complicate the integration of datasets.

    Celicourt and Piasecki (2016) have already developed a unit-

    of-measurements management and conversion tool named

    “HydroUnits” based on the units Controlled Vocabularies

    developed by CUAHSI. Thus, we are aware of the deﬁciencies

    and opportunities to improve this existing set of units. The

    improvement would include, for example, compliance with the

    Uniﬁed Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) to achieve greater

    interoperability (Schadow and McDonald, 2013). In addition, the

    CUAHSI units certainly need to be revised and augmented to

    become what we may call “AgroUnits.” This latter may ultimately

    serve to improve the deﬁciencies of existing ontologies used

    in agriculture.

    The development of agricultural knowledge management

    workﬂows would be an important step toward the next

    generation of FMIS as water resources management support is

    identiﬁed as a key bottleneck that hinders farm eﬃciency (Kruize

    et al., 2013). In addition, it creates the opportunity to incorporate

    support for whole-farm-system data provenance capture and

    preservation, in addition to traceability along the whole food

    system chain. This holds the beneﬁts of helping companies,

    governments, and farmers in the food chain to make informed

    decisions (Janssen et al., 2017).

    5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

    Agricultural production sustainability has become a critical, but

    challenging approach to meet food demands of the growing

    global

    population.

    This

    requires

    major

    transformations

    in

    agricultural

    practices

    through

    technological,

    social,

    and

    institutional

    innovations.

    Water

    resources

    planning,

    management and usage at the ﬁeld, farm, river basin, regional,

    and national scales represent a pivotal strategy to underpin these

    transformations. In this context, we have introduced a blueprint

    for a new interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research in agriculture

    named agricultural hydroinformatics. It is intended to employ

    hydroinformatics approaches to promote a holistic approach to

    agricultural water and knowledge management by considering

    the economic, engineering, social, hydrologic, environmental,

    and even political factors that inﬂuence agricultural water

    resources planning, management, and usage. Furthermore, it

    must foster adoption of technologies as a path forward to achieve

    sustainable agriculture in light of the anticipated increase in

    agricultural water demand due to climate change impacts and

    global population growth.

    We have introduced a new general conceptual framework that

    stems from the particularities of the sociotechnical dimension

    of using hydroinformatics in agriculture. The framework is

    designed to support, not only integrated agricultural resources

    and assets management, but also agricultural sustainability in

    general. It can also be used as a simple tool to gauge the degree

    of integration of (agricultural) water resources management

    programs or initiatives as it depicts the components (e.g., soil,

    water, land, crop, people) that may need to be considered. It also

    enables the development of an entirely integrated but discipline-

    delineated knowledge management workﬂows for agricultural

    production consisting of raw data, metadata-annotated data,

    storage and dissemination, models, and decision support system.

    We acknowledge that this blueprint for the proposed

    framework is freshly introduced and therefore, it has not yet

    been vetted by the hydroinformatics and agricultural research

    communities. Although it is developed to be as generic as

    possible, we believe it may evolve in many ways and under

    many circumstances. For example, the framework may evolve

    by integrating new ﬁelds of research, disciplines and practices

    as they emerge. The introduction of new ﬁelds and practices

    may lead to splitting a component or aggregation of two or

    more components of the framework. Sociohydrology is a typical

    example of an emerging ﬁeld of research that may lead to some

    transformations of the framework. These anticipated mutations,

    therefore, will give rise to more specialized as well as more

    mature and either more specialized or more generic versions

    of the framework. Multidisciplinary forms of intra- and inter-

    universities collaborative eﬀorts as well as development of new

    curricula to train agricultural hydroinformaticists will play an

    important role in paving the way for this new ﬁeld of research

    and framework to gain momentum. This is challenging, as

    the topics to be covered may range from information and

    decision theories to social sciences to legal sciences to ethics

    and philosophy of science; to name but a few. These initiatives

    will serve as a ground work for agricultural hydroinformatics

    to make a more signiﬁcant impact in driving agricultural

    sustainability transitions.

    Some major development must also occur in various

    technology-related research areas through collaboration between

    universities, research centers and technology companies applying

    the business dimension of hydroinformatics. These include, for

    example, the development of self-managed in-situ sensors, farm

    machinery and unmanned automated vehicles (UAVs) systems

    that are easy to deploy and require as little human intervention as

    possible. An important aspect of this self-management capability

    includes, for example, the embedding of artiﬁcial intelligence

    algorithms to enable sensing and control systems to perform and

    record automated signal and data quality control procedures.

    Another aspect is the automated management of both raw

    and processed data through the development of standardized

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    data models with provision for suﬃcient ancillary information

    to facilitate data interpretation, retrieval and integration. A

    third and critical aspect is the involvement of stakeholders

    including farmers throughout the research and development

    processes to tackle the knowledge and technology relevance

    issue and facilitate the adoption of resulting technologies. The

    phenomenological dimension of hydroinformatics will play a

    signiﬁcant role here. This latter aspect may be instrumental in

    gauging the level of system intelligence needed at the farm level

    and the cloud level.

    Lastly, the transformation in the role of farmers, agricultural

    technologists, and scientists from knowers to consumers of

    knowledge represents a milestone for agriculture to enter the

    postmodern era and for agricultural hydroinformatics to become

    a postmodern technology. Therefore, research and development

    eﬀorts must be conjugated toward a knowledge self-management

    system prototype as described in the paper to reverse the

    growing power/knowledge relationships related to innovative

    technologies adoption, and concepts such as big data and

    knowledge-intensive agriculture. This would be a turning point

    toward the co-creation of knowledge to the beneﬁts of all

    categories of farmers.

    It is when these ideas are turned into practical applications

    through

    the

    establishment

    of

    appropriate

    and

    adequate

    sociotechnical arrangements, as well as the provision of

    personalized and customized services with tangible beneﬁts, that

    agricultural hydroinformatics will fully play its role as a blueprint

    for the adoption of information technologies in agriculture to

    the beneﬁt of all farmers.

    \ irrigation. The question of how to monitor the combination of fertilizer concentration\
    \ and variable irrigation\ncomponents as accurately as possible is challenging.\
    \ The primary goal of this study is to develop accurate prediction models integrated\
    \ with machine\nlearning (ML) to predict the concentration of each type of fertilizers\
    \ in mixed variable-rate fertigation used for precision irrigation. First, the\
    \ feasibility of\npredicting of fertilizer concentration by monitoring physical\
    \ parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC), acidity (pH) and temperature\
    \ in mixed variable-\nrate fertigation was con¦rmed. 11 selected ML algorithms\
    \ were applied to develop regression models that can accurately predict each fertilizer\
    \ concentration\nof the mixed fertilizer compared to the classical multivariate\
    \ linear regression (MLR). In addition, cubic spline interpolation (CSI) was used\
    \ to densify the data\nsets, and K-fold cross-validation was employed to fairly\
    \ evaluate the generalization ability (GA) of these models. The statistical and\
    \ diagnostic analyzes\nrevealed the superiority of ML especially SVM, KNN, ETs,\
    \ and MLP over MLR in predicting each type of fertilizer concentration in mixed\
    \ variable-rate fertigation\nwith an R2 range of 0.9499 ~ 0.9970 and an RMSE range\
    \ of 0.0852 ~ 0.4434 g/L, better than MLR with an R2 range of 0.8544 ~ 0.9425\
    \ and an RMSE range of\n0.3752 ~ 0.7559 g/L. Moreover, the contribution of CSI\
    \ to the modeling accuracy was con¦rmed, but the sensitivity of the models to\
    \ EC and pH increased with\nthe data from CSI and the tuning of the model hyper-parameter.\
    \ Overall, the feasibility and performance of the ML models for predicting mixed\
    \ fertilizer\nconcentration by monitoring temperature, EC, and pH indicate that\
    \ the presented ML models have signi¦cant application potential for irrigation\
    \ and\nfertilization monitoring management of mixed variable-rate fertigation\
    \ in precision irrigation with high-precision sensor technology.\n1. Introduction\n\
    As one of the main backbones in many developing countries, the agricultural sector\
    \ has a signi¦cant impact on food production and job creation to meet the\nchallenge\
    \ of population growth and economic stability (Nandy and Singh, 2020). However,\
    \ agricultural production exacerbates natural resource consumption\nand destroys\
    \ ecology (Holling and Meffe, 1996; Tilman et al., 2001). How to balance agricultural\
    \ production, resource consumption, and environmental\nprotection is a constant\
    \ problem for sustainable agricultural development (Chandrajith et al., 2010).\
    \ It is expected that the introduction of precision agriculture\nis an effective\
    \ measure to mitigate the impact of agricultural production on resource consumption\
    \ and environmental pollution, and it is an inevitable trend in\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ (Gago et al., 2015; Lindblom et al., 2017). As one of the most important technology\
    \ and research focuses in precision agriculture\n(Hedley, 2015), precise variable-rate\
    \ fertigation with the advantages of water and fertilizer saving (Bai et al.,\
    \ 2020; Li et al., 2021), high yield and quality (Hartz\net al., 2005), ecological\
    \ safety and environmental friendliness (Eissa et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2017),\
    \ especially in arid and semi-arid or saline areas\n(Buvaneshwari et al., 2020;\
    \ Jayakumar et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2020), has created tremendous prospects\
    \ in modern agriculture. Based on irrigation and\nfertilization concentration\
    \ information and water-fertilizer integration technology, the mixing of water\
    \ and fertilizer is automatically and accurately controlled\nto optimize the targeted\
    \ irrigation and fertilization regulation (Coates et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019).\n\
    However, a prerequisite for precise variable-rate fertigation is mastery of real-time\
    \ information on fertigation concentration in irrigation lines. Real-time\nfertigation\
    \ concentration monitoring, especially in mixed variable-rate fertigation, becomes\
    \ the linchpin of accurate variable-rate fertigation. Traditional\nmonitoring\
    \ based on EC and pH focuses on a single fertilizer or total nutrients in irrigation\
    \ lines and is a mature system for irrigation and fertilization\ndecisions, but\
    \ it is woefully inadequate for managing mixed variable-rate fertigation. For\
    \ example, Fuangthong and Pramokchon (2018) designed an\nautomatic nutrient control\
    \ system for hydroponics based on EC and pH. Du et al. (2021) developed a highly\
    \ e¨cient water-fertilizer control system for cotton\nbased on EC and pH using\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network. Perez-Castro et al. (2017) developed a fertigation\
    \ management application for greenhouse vegetable\ncrops that monitors water and\
    \ fertilizer using EC and pH. To overcome the disadvantage of EC and pH in the\
    \ management of mixed variable-rate fertigation,\nan ion-selective electrode (ISE)\
    \ was used to determine the components of mixed fertilizer (Richa et al., 2021).\
    \ Jung et al. (2015) developed an automated\nsystem for the management of lettuce\
    \ nutrient solutions using an array of ISE. Kim et al. (2013) designed a computerized\
    \ measurement system using an\narray of ISE to automatically measure hydroponic\
    \ macronutrients. However, even today, relatively mature ISE sensors including\
    \ Ca2+, K+, NH4\n+, Na+, and Cl-,\netc., are not widely used for monitoring mixed\
    \ variable-rate fertigation in agricultural production due to the limiting factors\
    \ of high cost, low accuracy\n(Agyeman et al., 2022), limited lifetime, large\
    \ drift, and bias caused by interfering ions (Bailey et al., 1988; Bakker et al.,\
    \ 1997; Pellerin et al., 2016; Shao et al.,\n2020; Smith et al., 1999). In addition,\
    \ Wu et al. (2021) developed a fertigation monitoring system based on EC, which\
    \ successfully monitors the concentration\nof mixed fertilizers, but cannot be\
    \ used for mixed variable-rate fertigation. There is an urgent need to develop\
    \ new monitoring strategies for mixed variable-rate\nfertigation based on mature\
    \ and cost-effective hardware for precision irrigation.\nIn the last two decades,\
    \ the advent of Arti¦cial Intelligence (AI) has become an accelerator in many\
    \ ¦elds, revealing great potential for applications. For\nexample, in the area\
    \ of soil monitoring in agriculture, machine learning models (ML) have proven\
    \ to be very accurate in predicting soil moisture and salinity\n(Karandish and\
    \ Simunek, 2016; Xiao et al., 2023). In groundwater modeling, ML has been used\
    \ to predict groundwater quality for irrigation purposes (El Bilali\net al., 2021).\
    \ For precision irrigation management strategies, several studies have been conducted\
    \ using arti¦cial intelligent (AI) as reported by Abioye et al.\n(2020). Gutierrez\
    \ et al. (2007) proposed a monitoring system for in-line evaluation of nutrients\
    \ and undesirable compounds in fertigation solutions using a\nsensor array of\
    \ eight potentiometric sensors and an arti¦cial neural network (ANN), but the\
    \ strong interference effects could not be compensated. Chen et al.\n(2011) proposed\
    \ a virtual ion-selective electrode (VISE) by analyzing the correlation between\
    \ the components of the fertilizer solution based on the intrinsic\nanalysis of\
    \ plant growth and used the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) to measure\
    \ the components of the fertilizer solution. Tuan et al. (2020)\ndetermined multi-ions\
    \ in hydroponic nutrient solutions using six ISEs and deep kernel learning. Cho\
    \ et al. (2019) used an array of ion-selective electrodes with\na hybrid signal-processing\
    \ method based on a neural network to predict NO3-, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions in\
    \ hydroponic solutions. All these studies have indicated\nthat the ML model has\
    \ great potential for accurate fertigation monitoring.\nTo use the methods of\
    \ ML effectively, the amount of available data should be su¨cient to obtain satisfactory\
    \ results. However, in traditional laboratory\nexperiments, the cost of data in\
    \ terms of time, labor, and fund expenditures is usually prohibitive, making it\
    \ di¨cult to access large amounts of experimental\ndata. Interpolation can compensate\
    \ for sparse data with a common technique of predicting ¦xed-range data using\
    \ known data (Moon et al., 2019). Ge et al.\nPage 3/20\n(2018) used cubic spline\
    \ interpolation(CSI)to describe the radial water distribution pattern of sprinklers,\
    \ resulting in high computational accuracy; Fabio et al.\nMatsunaga et al. (2014)\
    \ modeled the 3D structure and rhythmic growth responses to the environment in\
    \ dioecious yerba-mate and found that CSI was more\naccurate to de¦ne the growth\
    \ parameter curves of yerba-mate. However, the applicability and impact of CSI\
    \ on densifying data sets in monitoring mixed\nvariable-rate fertigation were\
    \ not evaluated. In addition, despite the higher accuracy of the ML model in fertigation\
    \ monitoring mentioned above, the sensitivity\nof the models to the input variables\
    \ and the uncertainty of the models should be considered when using ML models,\
    \ especially when CSI has been introduced.\nTherefore, the main objectives of\
    \ this study are to (1) investigate the feasibility of real-time prediction of\
    \ any type of fertilizer concentration under mixed\nvariable-rate fertigation\
    \ by monitoring EC, pH, and temperature; (2) evaluate the ability of ML models\
    \ and CSI in predicting fertilizer concentration; (3) analyze\nthe uncertainty\
    \ and sensitivity of the predictive models. To achieve this, (1) the data sets\
    \ of EC-pH-temperature-dipotassium hydrogen phosphate\nconcentration-potassium\
    \ chloride concentration of the mixed fertilizer solution were densi¦ed using\
    \ CSI to obtain a large amount of data sets; (2) the ML\nmodels were selected\
    \ ¦rst, and then the effectiveness of the ML models was evaluated and compared;\
    \ (3) the sensitivity of EC, pH and temperature and the\nuncertainty of the selected\
    \ ML models in predicting the fertilizer concentration were analyzed.\n2. materials\
    \ and methods\n2.1 Experiment introduction\n2.1.1Experiment device layout\nFor\
    \ this experiment we constructed an apparatus, which was shown in Fig. 1. It consists\
    \ essentially of two parts: The ¦rst part is a temperature control module\nconsisting\
    \ of a water bath with a digital precision display and keeping stable temperature\
    \ with a control accuracy of ± 0.5 ℃, a small water pump with the\nfunction of\
    \ water circulation to keep the water temperature stable, a high precision thermometer\
    \ and a beaker. It is used for accurately adjusting the\ntemperature of the mixed\
    \ solution during the experiment; the second part is the module for data measurement,\
    \ reading, and storage of EC and pH, which\nincludes an EC electrode, a pH electrode,\
    \ an EC meter host, a pH meter host, and two laptops. It is used for data monitoring,\
    \ reading, and storing EC and pH for\nvarious mixed solutions. Since the conductivity\
    \ range of fertilizer solutions (0 ~ 10 g/L) used for agricultural production\
    \ is 500 ~ 5000 µS/cm, an industrial EC\nmeter from Hangzhou Liance Automation\
    \ Co., Ltd. with a measuring range of 2\020 000 µS/cm and automatic or manual\
    \ temperature compensation function\nwere used for this experiment. EC electrode\
    \ is extremely cylindrical and made of stainless steel with the following parameters:\
    \ electrode constant: 1.0,\nAccuracy: ±1%, stability: ±1% FS/24H. The pH electrode\
    \ is made of cylindrical polystyrene (PS) with a glass bulb ¦lled with reference\
    \ liquid at the bottom and\nwith the function of automatic or manual temperature\
    \ compensation with the following parameters: measuring range: 0 ~ 14, response\
    \ speed: 0.5s,\nmeasuring accuracy ≤ 0.01pH, working temperature range: 0\060\
    \ ℃. The EC meter host and the pH meter host in the experiment are each connected\
    \ to the\ncorresponding electrode, and the voltage changes of the electrodes are\
    \ converted into a digital output signal, and then transmitted to the computer\
    \ via the\nRS485 to USB serial port. The real-time data on the computer is read,\
    \ displayed, and stored by the supporting software. Finally, the data was exported\
    \ to Excel\nfor analysis.\n2.1.2 Experiment Material\nPotassium hydrogen phosphate\
    \ trihydrate (K2HPO4·3H2O) and potassium chloride (KCL) (Guangdong Guanghua Technology\
    \ Co., Ltd.) were selected as the\nmixed fertilizer solution in this experiment.\
    \ Moreover, secondary deionized water (SDW) was used in the preparation of the\
    \ fertilizer solution to remove the\nin§uence of impurities in the water and achieve\
    \ better performance in this experiment.\n2.1.3 Experiment Method\n2.1.3.1 mixed\

    \ reduce the in§uence of impurities in the beakers on the experimental result,\
    \ the beakers must be kept clean by soaking and washing with SDW 2 ~ 3 times\n\
    and ¦nally drying naturally in the shade. Before the experiment, the instrument\
    \ was turned on and an EC electrode and a pH electrode were immersed in the\n\
    solution to warm up, as presented in Fig. 1. In addition, the temperature of the\
    \ solution must be controlled accurately by using a water bath with a digital\n\
    precision display with constant temperature and high-precision thermometers at\
    \ the same time. Due to the terrible effect of the automatic temperature\ncompensation\
    \ of the electrode in the preliminary experiment, we selected the manual temperature\
    \ compensation mode and read the data from EC and pH of\nthe mixed fertilizer\
    \ solution after the temperature of the solution stabilized. To avoid cross-contamination\
    \ between the residual solution on the electrode and\nthe solution sample, the\
    \ electrode must be repeatedly rinsed with SDW and wiped dry before it can be\
    \ used for the next measurement. In the experiment, the\nEC and pH data of each\
    \ measurement sometimes contained some §uctuations, even single outliers, due\
    \ to temperature variations and other disturbances that\nwould seriously affect\
    \ the analysis of the data and the recognition of the result rules. Therefore,\
    \ we repeated the measurement three times to obtain a range of\ndata, and treated\
    \ a range of stable data as valid data, with the temperature ¦rst increasing from\
    \ 17 to 40 ℃ and then decreasing from 40 to 17 ℃. Finally, the\ndata were aggregated\
    \ as series data.\n2.2Data processing and analysis\n2.2.1 Data preprocessing\n\
    Data preprocessing mainly includes several aspects such as data cleaning, data\
    \ integration, data reduction, and data conversion (Famili et al., 1997;\nMatsunaga\
    \ et al., 2014). If the data is of high quality, it can be perfect for the intended\
    \ use. However, data quality is affected by many factors such as\naccuracy, completeness,\
    \ consistency, timeliness, credibility, and interpretability of data (Klein, 2001).\
    \ An important and di¨cult issue in processing\nexperimental data is how to eliminate\
    \ the in§uence of human subjective factors and the interference of non-stationary\
    \ data factors in data preprocessing,\naccurately ¦nd the representative value\
    \ data at each measurement point and reduce the measurement error of the system.\
    \ A good experimental data\npreprocessing program can signi¦cantly reduce the\
    \ effects of system data measurement drift on the results. In the experiment,\
    \ we used a variance\noptimization method based on dynamic weighting (DW) to preprocess\
    \ the experimental data of each measurement point. We construct a dynamically\n\
    weighted variance function S(x) and minimize the value. Thus, the representative\
    \ value of the measurement point was obtained, and the expression of S(x) is:\n\
    (1)\nwhere g(x) is a dynamic weighting variance function that can be dynamically\
    \ weighted by the error between the measured value and the representative value.\n\
    The larger the error between the measured value and the representative value,\
    \ the smaller the weight to avoid noise values affecting the value DW expression\n\
    of g(x) is expressed as follows:\n(2)\nAfter substituting the measured data at\
    \ the measurement point into equations (1) and (2), a one-variable quadratic function\
    \ with positive quadratic\ncoe¨cients is obtained, and the minimum value of the\
    \ function can be calculated to ¦nd the measured representative value of the point.\
    \ The various data are\npreprocessed with the dynamic weighting class variance\
    \ optimization method, and the DW is used to avoid the catastrophic effects of\
    \ outliers (data noise),\nwhich helps to improve the stability, representativeness,\
    \ and reliability of the data and enhances the noise immunity of the system.\n\
    2.2.2 Exploratory Analysis and CSI\nTo investigate the feasibility of predicting\
    \ the individual fertilizer concentrations by monitoring EC, pH, and temperature\
    \ in mixed variable-rate fertigation in\nadvance, an exploratory analysis of variance\
    \ (ANOVAs) using the SPSS Statistics 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to determine\
    \ the signi¦cant relationship\nbetween of the individual fertilizer concentrations\
    \ and the physical parameters.\nThe number of training samples affects the predictive\
    \ accuracy of the ML model (Ahmad et al., 2018). It is worth noting that spline\
    \ interpolation has been\nsuccessfully used to estimate the light absorption of\
    \ a plant (Zanetti et al., 1999), to determine the time-series fraction of absorbed\
    \ photosynthetically active\nradiation (Li et al., 2022), to calculate the water\
    \ distribution of a mobile sprinkler machine (Ge et al., 2018), and to simulate\
    \ solute transport in furrow irrigation\n(Perea et al., 2010), but not in mixed\
    \ variable fertigation. In this study, based on the property of second-order CSI,\
    \ which is continuously differentiable in nodes\n(Ge et al., 2018), CSI was used\
    \ to increase the number of data sets and the arrangement density of origin data\
    \ to build the ML model, and the process of data\ninterpolation was performed\
    \ using Origin2020b (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA, USA). Further details of CSI\
    \ have been described in detail in the literature\n(McKinley and Levine, 1998).\n\
    3 Machine Learning Models\n3.1. Machine learning algorithms\nMachine learning\
    \ (ML) has improved dramatically in many areas over the past two decades, evolving\
    \ from a laboratory curiosity to a practical technology that\nis widely used commercially\
    \ (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015). Due to the complex details of ML algorithms, which\
    \ cannot be presented in the limited space of this\npaper, the full details of\
    \ the widely used ML algorithms are readily available in the literature (Rasmussen,\
    \ 2004; Seber and Lee, 2003; Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-\nDavid, 2014). In this section,\
    \ we only summarize the advantages, shortcomings, and approaches to control the\
    \ performance of the selected algorithms.\nS(x) =\n∑n\ni=1 [(x−ai)2g(x)]\n1\n\
    n\ng(x) =\n∑n\ni=1 (x−ai)2−(x−ai)2\n∑n\ni=1 (x−ai)2\nPage 5/20\nDecision Tree\
    \ (DT) is a non-parametric divide-and-conquer approach to classi¦cation and regression\
    \ that can discover features and extract patterns in large\ndatabases that are\
    \ critical for predictive and discriminative modeling and can be interpreted intuitively\
    \ (Myles et al., 2004). However, DT is prone to over¦tting\nand instability (Pham\
    \ et al., 2021). To control the problem of over¦tting, four hyper-parameters were\
    \ used, including criterion to measure the quality of a split,\nmax_depth to determine\
    \ the maximum depth of the DT, max_features to determine the number of features\
    \ to consider when splitting, and splitter to determine\nthe splitting strategy\
    \ for each node.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is a non-parametric algorithm proposed\
    \ by Cortes and Vapnik (1995) that generally performs better even on high-dimensional\n\
    data. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring a considerable amount of computational\
    \ resources and occasionally suffering from numerical instability\nwhen ¦nding\
    \ solutions to optimization problems (Erfani et al., 2016). In this study, the\
    \ generalization performance of SVM was optimized by controlling the\nregularization\
    \ parameters of kernel, gamma, epsilon, and C.\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a\
    \ non-parametric supervised learning method ¦rst developed by Fix and Hodges (1951).\
    \ It is easy to implement without requiring\na training period but shows poor\
    \ performance on large datasets or high dimensions and is very computationally\
    \ intensive (Guo et al., 2003). The critical\nfactors used in this study to optimize\
    \ the performance of KNN include weights, p, n_neighbors, leaf_size, and algorithm.\n\
    Random Forest (RF) is a meta-estimator that ¦ts a set of classifying decision\
    \ trees to different subsamples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve\n\
    prediction accuracy and control over¦tting (Liaw and Wiener, 2002). It is less\
    \ prone to over¦tting and can output the very useful importance of features;\n\
    however, RF is sensitive to data noise and computationally complex (Hengl et al.,\
    \ 2018). In this study, the hyper-parameter n_estimators, min_samples_split,\n\
    min_samples_leaf, and max_features were used to optimize the performance of RF.\n\
    Gradient Boost (GB) is a machine learning technique that provides a predictive\
    \ model in the form of an ensemble of weak predictive models (Ponraj and\nVigneswaran,\
    \ 2020). It is generally more accurate than other methods and trains faster, especially\
    \ on large datasets. However, it is prone to over¦tting and is\nvery computationally\
    \ intensive. The generalization performance of GB was optimized in this study\
    \ by controlling n_estimators, max_features, max_depth, loss,\nlearning_rate,\
    \ and criterion.\nBootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) is an ensemble meta-algorithm\
    \ designed to improve the stability and accuracy of ML algorithms, which can be\
    \ executed in\nparallel and outperforms a single learning algorithm, but is computationally\
    \ intensive (Breiman, 1996). The critical factors controlling the performance\
    \ of\nBagging in this study include n_estimators, max_samples, and max_features.\n\
    Extremely Randomized Tree (ET) uses the same principle as Random Forest by using\
    \ a random subset of features to train each base estimator, which uses the\nentire\
    \ training dataset to train each regression tree (John et al., 2016). The three\
    \ hyper-parameter criteria, max_depth, and max_features were implemented in\n\
    this study to achieve good performance from ET.\nExtremely Randomized Trees (ETs)\
    \ are an ensemble algorithm that implements a meta-estimator that ¦ts a set of\
    \ randomized decision trees to different\nsubsamples of the dataset and uses averaging\
    \ to improve prediction accuracy and control over¦tting (Geurts et al., 2006).\
    \ The ETs in this study use three\ncrucial hyper-parameter, including the number\
    \ of trees in the forest (n_estimators), the function measuring the quality of\
    \ a partition (criterion), and\nmax_features, which determines the number of features\
    \ to be considered in the search for the best partition, to control the performance\
    \ of the ETs.\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) is also called Arti¦cial Neural Network\
    \ (ANN), which connects multiple neurons in the form of a network (Riedmiller\
    \ and Lernen,\n2014). It can easily learn nonlinear models but needs to tune the\
    \ hyper-parameter and determine the optimal architecture. Moreover, MLP is sensitive\
    \ to the\nscaling of the input features. The hyper-parameter for activation, hidden_layer_sizes\
    \ and solver is tuned to achieve good performance on this model.\nExtreme Gradient\
    \ Boosting (XGB) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed\
    \ to be highly e¨cient, §exible, and portable by implementing\nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms within the gradient boosting framework, and provides a parallel tree\
    \ boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) to handle data science\nproblems quickly\
    \ and accurately (Chen et al., 2015). In this study, the hyper-parameter of solver,\
    \ n_estimators, hidden_sizes, and activation were tuned to\noptimize the performance\
    \ of XGB.\nGaussian Process (GP) is a general supervised learning method designed\
    \ to solve regression and probabilistic classi¦cation problems. It is versatile\
    \ but loses\ne¨ciency in high-dimensional spaces (Dudley, 2010; Rasmussen, 2004).\
    \ The generalization error of GP was controlled in this study by tuning the hyper-\n\
    parameter of kernel and alpha.\n3.2 Selection of ML Algorithms\nThe selection\
    \ of ML algorithms is a key step in the development of suitable prediction models,\
    \ which determines the performance of mixed fertilizer prediction\nmodels. To\
    \ select as many suitable ML algorithms as possible to reduce the amount of work\
    \ required to tune the hyper-parameter,17 ML algorithms including\nStochastic\
    \ Gradient Descent (SGD), Ridge, Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM),\
    \ K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive\nBoosting (ADB), Gradient\
    \ Boosting (GB), Bagging, Extremely Randomized Trees (ETs), Extra Tree (ET), Least\
    \ Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\n(Lasso), Elastic Net (EN), Passive\
    \ Aggressive (PA), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)\
    \ and Gaussian Process (GP) were ¦rst trained\nand tested on the interpolated\
    \ datasets without tuning hyper-parameter. The metrics mentioned in section 3.4\
    \ were used to evaluate the model performance\nand then the algorithms with the\
    \ best performance were selected for tuning hyper-parameter.\n3.3 Tuning of hyper-parameter\
    \ and evaluation of model performance\nTo determine the ideal value of the hyper-parameter\
    \ of the ML algorithms trained to predict fertilizer concentration under mixed\
    \ variable-rate fertilization, a\nstandardized process was performed as described\
    \ in Fig. 2. First, the interpolated data sets were processed using train_test_split\
    \ and StandardScaler, which\nPage 6/20\nsplit the data set into training and validation\
    \ sets with a standard ratio of 7:3 and normalized from 0 to 1 to reduce the dimensional\
    \ in§uence of variables on\nmodel performance and improve model generalization.\
    \ Subsequently, the hyper-parameter of the ML algorithms was optimized using the\
    \ GridSearchCV\nfunction of Scikit-Learn and run on a prede¦ned value grid. For\
    \ fair evaluation, K-fold cross-validation (Fathalla et al., 2018) with shu©e\
    \ was used to\ninvestigate the performance of ML regression models during the\
    \ training phase. This is a resampling procedure in which the training set is\
    \ divided into k\nsubsets, with the selected k-1 subsets used as the training\
    \ datasets and the remaining subset used as the test dataset. The performance\
    \ measure reported by\nthe k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the\
    \ values computed in the loop (Rodriguez et al., 2010). In this study, k was set\
    \ to 5 and the R2 was used to\nevaluate the performance. GridSearchCV then provided\
    \ the best combination of hyper-parameter for the algorithm with the highest R2\
    \ value. Finally, the model\nmetrics mentioned in section 3.4 were calculated\
    \ for each algorithm with the best combination of hyper-parameter. In addition,\
    \ to evaluate the generalization\naccuracy of the models from ML, the validation\
    \ set that did not appear during training was used. In addition, the sensitivity\
    \ analysis and uncertainty analysis\nwere further analyzed during the validation\
    \ phase. The implementation of the ML algorithms included in the Scikit-Learn\
    \ module of the Python programming\nlanguage was used for all the development\
    \ and experimental work and was performed on a personal computer (AMD Ryzen 7\
    \ 3.2GHz with 16GB RAM).\n3.4 Metric evaluation models\nIn this study, the coe¨cient\
    \ of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative bias (RBIAS)\
    \ were used to accurately evaluate the performance\nof the developed ML models\
    \ in the training and testing datasets.\nThe coe¨cient of determination (R2) was\
    \ calculated according to Eq. (3). It indicates the percentage of squared correlation\
    \ between the target value and the\npredicted value and can be used to quantitatively\
    \ evaluate the quality of the mode: The higher the degree of explanation of the\
    \ independent variable for the\ndependent variable, the higher the percentage\
    \ of the total change caused by the independent variable. The higher the R2, the\
    \ better the performance of the\nmodel.\n(3)\nThe root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ is the square root of the variance of the residual errors. It is used to measure\
    \ the deviation between the observed value and\nthe true value and is described\
    \ in (4). The lower the value of the RMSE compared to the predicted or test range,\
    \ the better the model ¦ts.\n(4)\nThe relative bias (RBIAS) was the percentage\
    \ of absolute deviation from the target value used to assess whether the model\
    \ tended to underestimate (RBIAS > \n0) or overestimate (RBIAS < 0) and the target\
    \ value can be calculated from (5). The lower the absolute value of RBIAS, the\
    \ better the model and the less biased\nit is.\n(5)\nWhere\nis the predicted value,\
    \ \nis the actual value, is the mean value of the actual value, and n is the total\
    \ number of samples.\nIt is crucial to ensure the generalization ability of the\
    \ model during the development of the ML model. In this study, the generalization\
    \ ability (GA) was used to\nevaluate the generalization capacity of the model\
    \ during the model development. It was de¦ned by Yoon et al. (2011) for groundwater\
    \ prediction and\ndescribed in (6). When the values of GA are equal to 1, the\
    \ model is excellent. However, when GA is less than 1, the models are under-trained,\
    \ while greater than\n1, the models are over-trained.\n(6)\nIn addition, the overall\
    \ uncertainty of the ¦tted models was evaluated by comparing the observed and\
    \ predicted values. The standard deviation (SD) and\ncon¦dence bound (CB) can\
    \ be calculated as follows:\n (7) \n (8)\n(9)\nWhere ei is the error, z is the\
    \ z-score of the con¦dence level (1.96 when the con¦dence level is 95%),  is the\
    \ mean of ei, and n is the number of values used.\nR2 = 1 −\n∑n\ni=1 (^y i−yi)2\n\

    \ performed to determine the signi¦cant in§uence of the input variables on the\
    \ predictive performance\nof the models. For this purpose, the Extended Fourier\
    \ Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) was used, which is a global sensitivity analysis\
    \ approach based on\nvariance decomposition and suitable for nonlinear and non-monotonic\
    \ models (Guo et al., 2020).\n4. Results\n4.1 Preprocessing of the data\n4.1.1\
    \ Exploratory data analysis\nFirstly, the ANOVA between DP, PC fertilizer concentration\
    \ (CDP, CPC), and the physical indicators (EC, pH, and temperature) during the\
    \ mixed variable-rate\nfertigation was conducted to explore the feasibility of\
    \ predicting each type of fertilizer concentration (Table 2). The result demonstrated\
    \ that EC, the interaction\neffect of EC and pH had a highly signi¦cant relationship\
    \ with CDP and CPC (P < 0.01); the interaction effect of T and EC displayed a\
    \ signi¦cant relationship with\nCDP and CPC (P < 0.05); moreover, it is noteworthy\
    \ that pH and the interaction effect of T, EC, pH remained related to CDP but\
    \ not CPC, although they did not\nreach signi¦cance. These results re§ected that\
    \ each type of fertilizer concentration was associated with physical indicators\
    \ during mixed variable-rate\nfertilization. A similar conclusion is found in\
    \ the prediction of groundwater quality (El Bilali et al., 2021), which indicates\
    \ that it seems feasible to further\ninvestigate a solution for fertilizer concentration\
    \ prediction by monitoring physical indicators (EC, pH, and temperature) during\
    \ mixed variable-rate fertigation.\nTable 2\nResults of signi¦cance analysis of\

    Before training the ML model, the selected data are interpolated to densify the\
    \ datasets. The datasets of EC-pH-T-CDP and EC-PH-T-CPC were interpolated after\n\
    data processing using CSI to ensure continuity between each data node. The result\
    \ of the data distribution after interpolation can be seen in Fig. 3, where the\n\
    red and black lines represented the interpolated data and the original data respectively.\
    \ The data sets EC-pH-T-CDP and EC-PH-T-CPC increased sharply from\n183 to 3713.\
    \ The CSI contributed signi¦cantly to the amount of data included in the model\
    \ ¦t, which greatly accommodated the data volume requirements of\nthe ML model.\n\
    4.2 ML algorithms selection and training results\nThe selection of the ML algorithm\
    \ and training of the model is the crucial step for building a predictive model\
    \ of fertilizer concentration. In this work, 17 ML\nalgorithms, which are mature\
    \ in many aspects, were trained without tuning hyper-parameter using the datasets\
    \ of EC-pH-T-CDP and EC-pH-CPC. The result was\npresented in Table 3. The generalization\
    \ ability (GA) of the models based on datasets DP and PC indicated that except\
    \ for DT, ET, and EN on the dataset DP\nand KNN, ET, Lasso, EN, and PA on PC,\
    \ the GA value of all other models is above 1. This means that they focused more\
    \ on the training dataset than on a\ngeneral system, and the models were over-trained.\
    \ Besides, the R2 of DT, SVM, KNN, RF, GB, Bagging, ETs, ET, MLP, XGB, and GP\
    \ is in the range of 0.9491 ~ \n0.9935, better than SGD, Ridge, ADB, Lasso, EN,\
    \ and PA is in range of 0.2040 ~ 0.8544 on the DP dataset, the same situation\
    \ appeared in PC dataset, which\nhad the R2 of DT, SVM, KNN, RF, GB, Bagging,\
    \ ETs, ET, MLP, XGB, and GP range in 0.9633 ~ 0.9955, better than SGD, Ridge,\
    \ ADB, Lasso, EN, and PA in a range\nof 0.3513 ~ 0.9428 on PC dataset; Moreover,\
    \ the RMSE of DT, SVM, KNN, RF, GB, Bagging, ETs, ET, MLP, XGB, and GP is in a\
    \ range of 0.1603 ~ 0.4467 and\n0.1044 ~ 0.2998, lower than SGD, Ridge, ADB, Lasso,\
    \ EN, and PA with 0.6747 ~ 1.7675 and 0.3742 ~ 1.2599 on DP and PC datasets, respectively.\
    \ The index of\nR2 and RMSE demonstrated that the algorithms DT, SVM, KNN, RF,\
    \ GB, Bagging, ETs, ET, MLP, XGB, and GP performed better than the algorithms\
    \ for the\ndatasets DP and PC, which were selected to build more models for predicting\
    \ the concentration of mixed fertilizer with hyper-parameter tuning. However,\
    \ the\nRBIAS of DT, SVM, KNN, RF, GB, Bagging, ETs, ET, MLP, and XGB on the DP\
    \ dataset and DT, SVM, ET, and GP on the PC dataset were less than 0, implying\
    \ that\nthese models tended to slightly overestimate, but KNN, RF, GB, Bagging,\
    \ ETs, MLP and XGB on the PC dataset and GP on the DP dataset were greater than\
    \ 0\nand tended to slightly underestimate.\nPage 8/20\nTable 3\nMetrics of algorithms\

    during the training phase. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was also trained for\
    \ comparison with the ML algorithms. The results showed that SVM and ETs\nmodels\
    \ performed best in predicting the concentration of DP with signi¦cant values\
    \ of 0.9955 and 0.9955 for R2 and 0.1331 and 0.1329 for RMSE\nrespectively, compared\
    \ to other models. In addition, KNN, MLP, and XGB exhibited high accuracy in predicting\
    \ the concentration of DP with an R2 range of\n0.9905 ~ 0.9951 and RMSE range\
    \ of 0.1376 ~ 0.1916 compared to DT, RF, GB, Bagging, ET, and GP with R2 range\
    \ of 0.9694 ~ 0.9843 and RMSE range of\n0.2487 ~ 0.3503. Moreover, the models\
    \ of ML performed better in predictive accuracy, with an R2 value of 0.9494 ~ 0.9955,\
    \ which was 10.06%~15.41% higher\nthan the value 0.8626 of the MLR model, and\
    \ an RMSE value of 0.1329 ~ 0.3503, which was 51.74%~81.69% lower than the value\
    \ 0.7258 of the MLR model.\nHowever, the RBIAS was different. The RBIAS of the\
    \ GP model was 2.1279%, which means that the GP model tended to underestimate\
    \ the DP concentration\nand the average predicted value was less than 2.1279%\
    \ of the true value. The RBIAS of the other ML models were in the range of -0.7358%~-0.0585%,\
    \ which\nwas almost 0. This indicated that the ML models have almost no deviation\
    \ in predicting the DP concentration except GP.\nThe performance of the ML models\
    \ on PC was similar to that of the DP dataset. The SVM model obtained the best\
    \ accuracy in predicting the concentration of\nPC with the highest R2 of 0.9980\
    \ and the lowest RMSE of 0.0655 for the ML models. The ML models of KNN, ETs,\
    \ MLP, XGB, and GP also performed very well\nin R2 and RMSE, with values ranging\
    \ from 0.9932 to 0.9977 and 0.0683 to 0.1306 respectively, better than DT, RF,\
    \ GB, Bagging, and ET with values ranging\nfrom 0.9695 to 0.9877 and 0.1763 to\
    \ 0.2730 respectively. Besides, the models of ML performed better than the MLR\
    \ model with a higher R2 of 2.31%~5.32%\nand a lower RMSE of 28.98% ~82.09%. Furthermore,\
    \ the KNN model tended to underestimate the concentration of PC and the average\
    \ predicted value was\nless than 1.22% of the true value with an RBIAS of 1.22%,\
    \ while the remaining ML model tended to predict the concentration of PC almost\
    \ unbiased with a tiny\nRBIAS range of 0.0049%~0.4880%.\nComparing these models,\
    \ SVM performed the most excellent performance in predicting DP or PC concentration,\
    \ followed by ETs, MLP, KNN, XGB, GP, RF,\nBagging, GB, ET, and DT, which obtained\
    \ excellent performance in prediction accuracy than the MLR model but poor performance\
    \ in RBIAS, especially GP at\nDP and KNN on PC. Interestingly, the GP model re§ected\
    \ a difference in predicting the concentrations of DP and PC, performing better\
    \ with high accuracy and\nlower prediction bias at PC, but reversed at DP.\nTable\

    \ process, the validation dataset of 929 samples that did not appear in the training\
    \ phase and the trained models were used for the validation\nphase and the evaluation\
    \ of the generalization performance. Table 6 resented the metrics R2, RMSE, and\
    \ RBIAS of the models during the validation phase. The\nmodels of ML performed\
    \ better than the MLR model in terms of accuracy with a higher R2 of 3.26%~16.320%\
    \ and lower RMSE of 31.74%~79.15% compared\nwith to the models DT, GB, Bagging,\
    \ ET, RF, XGB, and GP. The models of SVM, KNN, ETs, MLP, and XGB obtained better\
    \ accuracy in predicting the DP\nconcentration with R2 from 0.9888 to 0.993 7\
    \ and RMSE from 0.157 6 to 0.2095 and PC with R2 from 0.992 1 to 0.9968. Meanwhile,\
    \ the GP model performed\nwell in accurately predicting PC concentration but slightly\
    \ worse at DP. However, the prediction bias of the SVM, KNN, ETs, MLP, and XGB\
    \ models was different\nfor DP and PC, DP with RBIAS < 0 was slightly overestimated,\
    \ while PC with RBIAS > 0 was underestimated.\nIn conjunction with Table 5 and\
    \ Table 6, it can also be seen that all the predictive models in the training\
    \ phase had slightly better predictive accuracy than the\nmodels evaluated in\
    \ the validation phase, and the ML models of SVM, KNN, ETs, MLP, and even XGB\
    \ performed better than the ML models of DT, RF, GB,\nBagging, and ET in accurately\
    \ predicting DP or PC concentration during the training process or validation\

    \ of the validated and predicted concentrations of DP and PC by MLR and ML models\
    \ during the validation phase. The\naccuracy of the models was satisfactory when\
    \ the scatter points were distributed transversely or evenly on both sides of\
    \ the line y = x, and the color of the\nscatter points represents the relative\
    \ error (RE) between the predicted concentration and the true concentration. The\
    \ ¦gure re§ected that the distribution of\nscatter on DP and PC by ML models over\
    \ the y = x line was better than MLR models, the scatter was clustered more over\
    \ the y = x line than MLR models, and\nthe RE of ML models was lower than MLR\
    \ models. In addition, among the ML models, the SVM, KNN, ET, and MLP models got\
    \ better performance in predicting\nthe concentration of DP and PC, with the predicted\
    \ concentrations closer to the actual concentration; however, the ML models DT,\
    \ RF, GB, Bagging, and ET\ndemonstrated that the scatter along the y = x line\
    \ was more loosely distributed and the magnitude of RE was greater; and for the\
    \ XGB and GP models, which\nperformed better in predicting the PC concentration,\
    \ with the scatter along the y = x line being more clustered than for DP. These\
    \ results indicated the\nsuperiority of the ML models especially SVM, KNN, ETs,\
    \ and MLP, compared to the MLR model in predicting the concentration of the mixed\
    \ fertilizer solution.\nFrom the comparison of the performance details shown in\
    \ Table 6, it can be concluded that:1) the ML models performed better than the\
    \ MLR model in\npredicting the concentrations of DP and PC; 2) the ETs, MLP, KNN,\
    \ and SVM models performed better than the XGB, RF, GP, Bagging, GB, ET, and DT\
    \ models in\npredicting the concentration DP; 3) the models of GP, MLP, SVM, ETs,\
    \ KNN, and XGB performed better than the models of Bagging, RF, GB, ET, and DT.\
    \ Except\nfor the GP in predicting the DP concentration and KNN in predicting\
    \ the PC concentration, all other models had an RBIAS of less than 1% in absolute\
    \ values,\nindicating that the ¦tted models are unbiased. These results revealed\
    \ that the ML models were superior to the traditional MLR model in terms of accuracy.\n\
    However, in real-time prediction of mixed fertilizer concentration in precision\
    \ irrigation, it is not enough to focus only on accuracy, but the performance\
    \ of\ngeneralization ability and stability of the model should also be considered.\
    \ The model that has better accuracy but is sensitive to the input variables and\n\
    generalizes poorly cannot be used to predict the concentration of mixed fertilizer.\
    \ In addition, the noisy data caused by the instability of the sensors but\nincluded\
    \ in the models should be considered. Therefore, the stability of the ML models\
    \ used for real-time mixed fertilizer concentration prediction should be\ninvestigated,\
    \ especially when this approach is used in a precision irrigation decision system\
    \ to manage irrigation and fertilization. For this reason, the\ngeneralization\
    \ ability and sensitivity to input variables of the ML models were further investigated.\n\
    The generalization ability (GA) indices of the MLR and ML models were calculated\
    \ using Eq. (6) and presented in Table 7. The result indicated that the GA\nindices\
    \ of the models RF, GB, Bagging, and GP were close to 1 in predicting the DP concentration\
    \ and the models DT, RF, and Bagging are close to 1 in\npredicting the PC concentration,\
    \ indicating that they had a good balance between the training accuracy of the\
    \ model and the generalization ability despite\nrelatively low accuracy. However,\
    \ the GA indices of the DT and ET models in predicting the DP concentration and\
    \ the XGB model in predicting the PC\nconcentration were greater than 1, demonstrating\
    \ that they focused more on the training dataset than forming a general system\
    \ for generalization and were\nover-trained (Chen et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2011).\
    \ Moreover, the GA indices of the SVM, ETs, and MLP models were greater than 1\
    \ in predicting the DP and PC\nconcentration, i.e., the SVM, ETs, and MLP models\
    \ performed poorly in generalization ability although they performed better in\
    \ accuracy, the KNN model in\npredicting the PC concentration behaved better in\
    \ generalization ability but was over-trained in predicting the DP concentration.\
    \ It is worth noting that although\nthe RF and Bagging models did not perform\
    \ as well as the SVM, KNN, ETs, and MLP models in terms of prediction performance,\
    \ their overall generalization\nabilities were excellent.\nPage 11/20\nTable 7\n\

    \ uncertainty in irrigation and fertilizer management in agriculture underscores\
    \ its fundamental signi¦cance, and such concerns have been\nthe subject of numerous\
    \ academic inquiries (Guo et al., 2020; Hernandez and Mulla, 2008; Litaor et al.,\
    \ 2013). In this study, the overall uncertainty of the ¦tted\nMLR and ML models\
    \ was analyzed. Table 8 presented the mean prediction error ( ) and 95% con¦dence\
    \ band (CB) in predicting the concentrations of DP and\nPC for 929 samples used\
    \ during the validation phase. The uncertainty analysis result demonstrated that\
    \ the ETs, MLP, SVM, and KNN models had a smaller\n95% con¦dence band in predicting\
    \ the DP concentration compared to the other ML models, including the MLR model.\
    \ The GP, MLP, SVM, ETs, and KNN models\nsimilarly exhibited smaller 95% con¦dence\
    \ bands when predicting the PC concentration in this study than the other ML models,\
    \ even including the MLR model.\nTable 8\nUncertainty analysis of the models.\n\

    \ the accuracy and generalizability of the ML model results indicated the feasibility\
    \ of the applied ML models in predicting the mixed fertilizers\nconcentration\
    \ during mixed variable-rate fertigation using the physical indicators (temperature,\
    \ pH, and EC) as input variables. In addition, the sensitivity of the\napplied\
    \ models to the input variables should be analyzed because the highly sensitive\
    \ models are dramatically biased by noisy data. In this study, the\nsensitivity\
    \ analysis of the ¦tted models was implemented using the Extended Fourier Amplitude\
    \ Sensitivity Test (EFAST). In addition to the noise of the input\nvariables (± 2\
    \ ℃ for the temperature, ± 1000 µS.cm− 1 for the EC, and ± 0.3 pH unit), two indices\
    \ were calculated for each input variable, including the ¦rst-\norder sensitivity\
    \ index (S1) and the total-order sensitivity index (ST), where S1 re§ects the\
    \ contribution of a single input variable to the output variance, while\nST considers\
    \ the interactions between different variables. The results of the sensitivity\
    \ analysis of the mixed fertilizer concentration prediction models were\npresented\
    \ in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the sensitivity to the input variables was\
    \ different for the DP and PC prediction models. In general, the DP prediction\n\
    models were sensitive to pH, followed by EC and temperature, but the PC prediction\
    \ models were sensitive to EC, followed by pH and temperature. Besides, the\n\
    sensitivity of the models to the input variables varied from one input to another,\
    \ from one parameter to another, and from one model to another. Moreover, the\n\
    lowest sensitivity of the ML models to all parameters was GB in predicting DP\
    \ concentration, followed by ETs, XGB, KNN, Bagging, RF, ET, DT, MLP, SVM, and\n\
    GP; however, in predicting PC concentration, it was XGB, ETs, Bagging, RF, ET,\
    \ DT, KNN, GB, MLP, SVM, and GP. Moreover, the sensitivity of the MLR model to\n\
    the variables was lower than that of the ML model in predicting the concentration\
    \ of both DP and PC. These results indicated that when using the ML model to\n\
    predict mixed fertilizer concentration, the EC and pH should be closely monitored\
    \ due to their high sensitivity.\n5. Discussion\n5.1 The feasibility of predicting\
    \ mixed fertilizer concentration by physical parameters in\nmixed variable-rate\
    \ fertigation\nMonitoring fertilizer concentration is a critical process in precision\
    \ irrigation (Blackmer and White, 1998; Lin et al., 2020). Traditional monitoring\
    \ methods used\nin mixed nutrient solutions mainly depended on ion selective electrodes\
    \ (ISE) (Bailey et al., 1988; Kim et al., 2013), but even today, relatively mature\
    \ ISE\nsensors including Ca2+, K+, NH4\n+, Na+, and Cl− etc., are not yet widely\
    \ used in monitoring mixed fertigation during agricultural production due to the\
    \ limiting\nfactors of high cost, low accuracy, short lifetime, large drift and\
    \ susceptibility to interference from other ions (Adamchuk et al., 2004; Kim et\
    \ al., 2013).\nCurrently, widely used, and mature sensors for fertilizer monitoring\
    \ in agriculture mainly include EC and pH sensors, which perform better in monitoring\n\
    individual fertilizers or the overall situation of the nutrient solution and offer\
    \ the advantages of capital investment, precision, stability, durability, and\n\
    robustness, but have limited applications in mixed fertilizer solutions.\nIn this\
    \ study, EC and pH of mixed fertilizer solution DP and PC were monitored with\
    \ the change of concentration, temperature, and formulation. The signi¦cant\n\
    relationship between the concentration of each type of fertilizer and the physical\
    \ indicators (EC, pH, and temperature) and even the interaction between them\n\
    was carried out in exploratory data analysis, which provided the theoretical basis\
    \ for predicting the mixed fertilizer concentration by EC, pH, and temperature.\n\
    −e\n−\ne\n−\ne\nPage 12/20\nThen, the DP and PC concentration of mixed fertilizer\
    \ was predicted considering EC, pH, and temperature, and the prediction models\
    \ were built using MLR and\nML algorithms. The result of the MLR model initially\
    \ indicated that it was suitable for predicting DP and PC mixed fertilizer considering\
    \ EC, pH, and\ntemperature values. The test performance metrics R2, RMSE, CB,\
    \ and RBIAS are 0.8544, 0.7559, 0.0486, and 0.9550% for DP and 0.9425, 0.3752,\
    \ 0.0241, and − \n0.8014% for PC, respectively. When algorithms of ML were used\
    \ in model building, the prediction model performed better, with the test performance\
    \ metrics R2,\nRMSE, CB, and RBIAS in the range of 0.9499 ~ 0.9937, 0.1576 ~ 0.4434,\
    \ 0.0101 ~ 0.0285, -1.1329%~2.1866% in DP and 0.9732 ~ 0.9970, 0.0852 ~ 0.2561,\n\
    0.0055 ~ 0.0165, 1.4211%~6.6228% respectively in PC, which con¦rmed the feasibility\
    \ of predicting mixed fertilizer concentrations using innovative strategy\nby\
    \ monitoring physical parameters. In addition, physical parameters such as EC\
    \ and pH have been used in the predictions of groundwater quality (El Bilali et\n\
    al., 2021) and the estimation of nutrient concentrations in rivers (Castrillo\
    \ and Garcia, 2020). All this indicated that it is possible to predict the elemental\n\
    composition of irrigation water using EC, pH, and temperature, with ML performing\
    \ better in predicting the concentration of mixed fertilizers. Thus, combining\n\
    existing proven hardware technology with innovative application strategies to\
    \ address complex challenges in precision irrigation is an idea for future research.\n\
    5.2 The superior performance and huge application potential of AI in irrigation\
    \ and fertilization management of modern agriculture\nThe digital transformation\
    \ of agriculture has transformed various aspects of management into arti¦cially\
    \ intelligent systems(Chamara et al., 2022). Machine\nlearning, a subset of arti¦cial\
    \ intelligence, is trained by the ever-growing data from numerous sources and\
    \ has signi¦cant potential to address complex\nchallenges (Benos et al., 2021).\
    \ It has already been applied to fertigation monitoring and management and has\
    \ improved system performance. El Bilali et al.\n(2021) use ML to predict groundwater\
    \ quality for irrigation purposes, Goap et al. (2018) use ML and open source technologies\
    \ to set up a smart irrigation\nmanagement system, Guo et al. (2017) use ML and\
    \ phenotyping to discriminate the water status in the root zone of plants in greenhouse\
    \ production, Navarro-\nHellin et al. (2016) use ML to set up a decision support\
    \ system for irrigation management in agriculture. Castrillo and Garcia (2020)\
    \ show that the ML model\nperformed signi¦cantly better than the MLR model in\
    \ estimating high-frequency nutrient concentrations for water management. Ebrahimi\
    \ et al. (2017) reveal\nthat ML had better performance in predicting the population\
    \ of Azotobacter in WG than MLR. The above studies have revealed the feasibility\
    \ and excellent\nperformance of ML in monitoring and managing irrigation and fertilization\
    \ in agriculture. The same conclusion can be drawn in this study: ML can promote\n\
    the performance of the predictive model. When ML algorithms are implemented, the\
    \ superior performance of the mixed fertilizer concentration prediction\nmodel\
    \ can be recognized in training, testing, or validation datasets, especially in\
    \ SVM, KNN, ETs, and MLP. Therefore, leveraging the strengths of AI in\naddressing\
    \ complex agricultural management challenges to enhance the ability of precision\
    \ irrigation to make irrigation decisions is an important focus for\nfurther investigation.\n\
    5.3 The impact of data interpolation and tuning hyper-parameter on models’ performance\n\
    Data preprocessing and model tuning hyper-parameter had a major impact on the\
    \ performance of the ML model. To evaluate the in§uence of the data-CSI and\n\
    tuning hyper-parameter on the performance of the ML model, the overall metrics\
    \ of RMSE, R2, RBIAS, CB, GA, and even ST of ML models were clari¦ed in\npredicting\
    \ the DP and PC concentrations, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.\
    \ Compared with N-N ¦tted models, the RMSE, CB and absolute RBIAS of\nCSI-N and\
    \ CSI-HT ¦tted models decreased, but R2 and GA increased, indicating that the\
    \ data-CSI and model hyper-parameter tuning contributed to model\nperformance\
    \ in terms of accuracy and stability, but the models tended to focus more on training\
    \ than on the general system and were slightly over-trained.\nSimilarly, Rodriguez\
    \ et al. (2021) found that CSI can contribute to a smart farming system. However,\
    \ the ST of CSI-N and CSI-HT ¦tted models behaved\ndifferently from N-N ¦tted\
    \ models in predicting DP and PC concentration. With data-CSI and model hyper-parameter\
    \ tuning, the ST of the DP prediction models\nincreased to temperature and EC,\
    \ and the ST to pH decreased, implying that the data-CSI and tuning model hyper-parameter\
    \ improved the sensitivity of the DP\nprediction models to temperature and EC\
    \ but decreased the sensitivity to pH. For the PC prediction models, the ST increased\
    \ for temperature and pH, but\ndecreased for EC, indicating that the data-CSI\
    \ and tuning model hyper-parameter promoted the sensitivity of the PC prediction\
    \ models to temperature and pH,\nbut crippled the sensitivity to EC, despite promoting\
    \ the ¦tted models in terms of model accuracy and stability.\n5.4 Field practical\
    \ implementation in precision irrigation and future work\nThe issue of e¨cient\
    \ irrigation and fertilization management is a crucial aspect of precision irrigation,\
    \ which has great potential to alleviate water scarcity\n(Rosa et al., 2020),\
    \ improve fertilizer use (Wang et al., 2021), reduce pollution (Liu et al., 2013;\
    \ Zhang et al., 2019), reduce agricultural production risk, and\nensure food security\
    \ (Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010; Peng et al., 2021), especially in arid and semi-arid\
    \ regions. However, to accurately manage irrigation and\nfertilization in ¦eld\
    \ production, real-time regulation of irrigation water and fertilizer concentration\
    \ is essential. These processes require real-time assessment of\nfertilizer solution\
    \ composition in mixed variable-rate fertigation, which is di¨cult when using\
    \ a conventional method, especially for smallholder farmers who\nare constrained\
    \ by cost and technology.\nIn this study, the trained and validated ML models\
    \ were established to predict the individual fertilizer concentrations in mixed\
    \ variable-rate fertigation using\nonly physical indicators (temperature, EC,\
    \ and pH) as predictors. The results of this study showed that the ML models,\
    \ especially SVM, KNN, ETs, and MLP,\nhave higher accuracy and robustness in predicting\
    \ fertilizer concentration than the MLR model. In addition, the generalization\
    \ ability of the ML models was\nanalyzed, and the results indicated that the models\
    \ DT, SVM, KNN, ETs, ET, and MLP at DP and SVM, MLP, XGB, and GP at PC should\
    \ control the training level\nto avoid overtraining; however, the models GB and\
    \ ET at PC should increase the training to avoid undertraining. In addition, the\
    \ uncertainty and sensitivity of\nthese models to the input variables have revealed\
    \ that the sensitivity of the ML models to the input variables should be considered,\
    \ especially the ML models\nto pH in predicting DP and the ML models to EC in\
    \ predicting PC. Indeed, the use of high-precision sensor technologies should\
    \ be considered when deploying\nsensitive ML models. Overall, the performances\
    \ of the ML models are acceptable for predicting the individual fertilizer concentrations\
    \ of mixed fertilizers, and\ntherefore help farmers to manage irrigation and fertilization\
    \ e¨ciently and cost-effectively with sophisticated sensors. Real-time prediction\
    \ of individual\nfertilizer concentrations in mixed variable-rate fertigation\
    \ enables optimization of the fertigation strategy to balance the trade-off between\
    \ inputs, outputs, and\nenvironmental impacts as best as possible in agricultural\
    \ production systems.\nPage 13/20\nHowever, this study still had some limitations\
    \ that should be considered and overcome in future research. First, the ability\
    \ of the predictive ML model with the\nin§uence of water sources (tap water, well\
    \ water, or river water) needs further investigation. Second, improving the applicability\
    \ for mixed neutral fertilizer\nestimation remains another problem to be solved\
    \ in the future study. One possible attempt could be to apply e¨cient sensor types,\
    \ such as dielectric sensors\nor coupling as few ISE as possible. Third, many\
    \ factors such as §ow rate, air and even water pressure in the pipeline, and insoluble\
    \ substances in the water\nmay disrupt the sensors. Therefore, the ability of\
    \ the model to predict mixed fertilizer should be further investigated with the\
    \ inclusion of these factors.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this study, the feasibility of\
    \ mixed fertilization of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and potassium chloride\
    \ as a case for predicting mixed fertilizer\nconcentration with physical indicators\
    \ (EC, pH, temperature) in variable-rate mixed fertilizer fertigation used for\
    \ precision irrigation was investigated. Then, the\nperformance of the selected\
    \ ML models of DT, SVM, KNN, RF, GB, Bagging, ETs, ET, MLP, XGB, and GP from 17\
    \ versatile ML algorithms was evaluated against\nthe performance metrics for predicting\
    \ fertilizer concentration. The contribution of CSI to the ML models, the sensitivity\
    \ of the models to the physical\nindicators, and the uncertainty of the ML models\
    \ were further analyzed and discussed. Through this study, the major ¦ndings are\
    \ as follows:\n1. The physical indicators (EC, pH, and temperature) during mixed\
    \ variable-rate fertigation with mature and cost-effective hardware have a great\
    \ potential to\nre§ect fertilization concentration information and can contribute\
    \ to the real-time online monitoring of the fertigation process in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. In this work, the ML models outperformed the MLR models, except for sensitivity\
    \ to variables that were higher than the MLR model in either predicting the\n\
    concentration of DP or PC.\n3. Data-CSI contributes signi¦cantly to increasing\
    \ the amount of dataset and further improving the performance of the ML models.\n\
    4. Overall, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the ML models have greater\
    \ sensitivity to the variables and higher accuracy compared to the MLR models.\n\
    ML models, especially SVM, KNN, ETs, and MLP, in combination with sensors relying\
    \ on physical indicators as features, are e¨cient tools to re§ect the water-\n\
    fertilizer information and are strongly recommended to develop innovative strategies\
    \ and reliable models for mixed variable-rate fertigation as well as for\nfurther\
    \ applications in precision irrigation with high precision of sensor technology.\n\

    \ in-depth contextualized tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), cov-\nering\
    \ the fundamental concepts, assessment of routing architectures and protocols,\
    \ and performance\noptimization techniques via a systematic survey and synthesis\
    \ of the related literature. The negative\nimpacts of climate change and the increasing\
    \ global population on food security and unemployment\nthreats have motivated\
    \ the adoption of the wireless sensor network (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an\nindispensable\
    \ underlying technology in precision agriculture and greenhouses to improve food\n\
    production capacities and quality. However, most related Agri-IoT testbed solutions\
    \ have failed to\nachieve their performance expectations due to the lack of an\
    \ in-depth and contextualized reference\ntutorial that provides a holistic overview\
    \ of communication technologies, routing architectures, and\nperformance optimization\
    \ modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although IoT applications\nare\
    \ founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT) varies based on the\
    \ speciﬁc performance\nand user expectations as well as technological, architectural,\
    \ and deployment requirements. Likewise,\nthe agricultural setting is a unique\
    \ and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not\napply, hence the\
    \ need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these via the\
    \ following\ncontributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts,\
    \ technologies, and architectural\nstandards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the technical design requirements of a robust,\nlocation-independent, and\
    \ affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking\nfault-tolerance\
    \ techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control (MAC)\n\
    protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth case\
    \ study on how to\ndesign a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, affordable, adaptive,\
    \ stable, autonomous, and cluster-based\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\
    \ taxonomy of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics\nthat can guarantee an\
    \ optimized network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new\n\
    taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\nnetworks and a three-tier objective framework with remedial\
    \ measures for designing an efﬁcient\nassociated supervisory protocol for cluster-based\

    \ tutorials have been authored on this subject, they present\nmere classifications\
    \ of communications trends on classical IoT [2,5–8] without any context-\nspecific\
    \ technical considerations of the critical design expectations in Figure 2. For\
    \ instance,\nthe authors in [2,6,7] examined IoT’s communication infrastructure,\
    \ platforms, standards,\ndevelopment trends, and possible network solutions in\
    \ agriculture. Similarly, the roles of\nindustrial IoT (thus, identification-based\
    \ IoT (example, RFID [6], WSN [9], QR codes [5],\nbarcodes) and communication-based\
    \ IoT (example, ZigBee [5], Z-wave [6], MQTT [5,6],\nLoRa [10], SigFox [11], BLE\
    \ [12], Li-Fi [5], Wi-Fi [13], Near-Field Communication (NFC) [5],\nand power\
    \ line area network) were reviewed in terms of current research trends, applications,\n\
    and main challenges in [5]. Although RFID tags and WSNs have similar data acquisition\n\
    capacities, the authors concluded that WSN technology is more energy-efficient\
    \ and suitable\nfor Agri-IoT than the costly RFID technologies [5]. Overall, Agri-IoT\
    \ technology has not\nyielded its intended paradigm transformation in the agricultural\
    \ sector due to several technical\nchallenges that have not received adequate\
    \ contextual research considerations [14]:\n1.\nThe agricultural setting is a\
    \ unique area where conventional IoT technologies do\nnot apply. Existing Agri-IoT\
    \ solutions are location-restricted because they are mostly\nbased on Wi-Fi or\
    \ cellular communication technologies and electricity grids with\nconstrained\
    \ coverages in Africa. A typical African agricultural setting lacks access\nto\
    \ reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based technologies,\
    \ and the\nintended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income earners\
    \ with limited\ntechnological expertise. Common Agri-IoT applications mainly utilize\
    \ architecture-\nrestricted, high-resource-demanding routing techniques (e.g.,\
    \ routing over low-power\nand lossy networks protocol (RPL)) and communication\
    \ standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Zig-\nBee, LoRa, Wi-FI, and long-term evolution (LTE))\
    \ [15], which are difﬁcult to access\nin typical African farms. Consequently,\
    \ Agri-IoT users in Africa expect a context-\nrelevant solution that is affordable,\
    \ simple to deploy and operate by non-experts,\nlocation-unrestricted, supportive\
    \ of large-scale farm management, and based on freely\navailable technologies\
    \ that do not require licensing. Thus, they are unlike popular IoT\nuse cases\
    \ such as medical, vehicular, and industrial IoT, whose designs are mainly\naffected\
    \ by critical factors including security, stable connectivity, and interference,\n\
    respectively, Agri-IoT is compelled to drive on affordable battery-powered SNs,\
    \ which\nmake architecture, low-power communication technology, power optimization,\
    \ cost,\nfault tolerance, multihop routing, scalability, and environmental impact\
    \ critical design\nfactors in order to address its resource or deployment-induced\
    \ challenges [12,16,17].\n2.\nHigh susceptibility to faults and failures: Agri-IoT\
    \ networks are vulnerable to faults\nand failures since the resource-constrained\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in hostile envi-\nronments to autonomously operate\
    \ via a network supervisory protocol with limited\npost-deployment maintenance\
    \ services. This supervisory protocol must incorporate\nsufﬁcient power optimization,\
    \ auto-fault management (FM), and self-adaptability\ntechniques in order to achieve\
    \ the desired performance expectation. Due to the lack of\nan in-depth and context-relevant\
    \ tutorial that bridges the gap between theoretical tax-\nonomies and real-world\
    \ designs, most canon Agri-IoT testbed solutions, such as those\nauthored in [1,10,11,17–20],\
    \ suffered abrupt failures during outdoor deployments.\n3.\nAgri-IoT technology\
    \ lacks comprehensive context-based synthesis from SN de-\nsign to ﬁeld deployment.\n\
    The power- and resource-constrained SNs that form\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT network\
    \ in the aforementioned context require limited\ndata transmission rates, computational\
    \ capabilities, memory capacities, commu-\nnication distance, and operational\
    \ stability. Consequently, the associated routing\nprotocol [9,12,17,21], communication\
    \ technology, and routing architecture [22–24]\nmust support mechanisms that ensure\
    \ packet size and communication distance mod-\neration [16], efﬁcient channel\
    \ access management (CAM), and SN’s tasks manage-\nment. It is not a mere application\
    \ of conventional IoT to a farm, as many authors\nattempted [1,10–12,17–20,23,25,26],\
    \ which lacked application-speciﬁc requirements\nsuch as dense network inter-connectivity,\
    \ higher information perceptibility, compre-\nIoT 2023, 4\n268\nhensive intelligence\
    \ services, remote monitoring, smart decision making, and the\nexecution of precise\
    \ control/actuation actions on the farm.\n4.\nSuperﬁcial consideration of desired\
    \ communication technologies of Agri-IoT with-\nout considering the cluster-based\
    \ architecture: To date, Agri-IoT-related surveys and\ntutorials focused on high-power-demanding\
    \ communication technologies (Wi-Fi and\ncellular-based technologies), the centralized\
    \ architecture-constrained ZigBee standard,\nand the operation principles of conventional\
    \ IoT as authored in [1,10,11,14,18,19]\nwithout an in-depth consideration of\
    \ the unique case of Agri-IoT. It is well estab-\nlished that the cluster-based\
    \ architecture is the best candidate for Agri-IoT applica-\ntion [12,16,17,24];\
    \ however, there are no systematic evaluations to cement this fact.\nFor instance,\
    \ most benchmarking WSN-based IoT testbed solutions are founded on the\nZigBee\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard and high-resource-demanding Wi-Fi,\ncellular-based,\
    \ and 6LoWPAN/IPv6 routing standards. These standards also thrive on\nwired or\
    \ ﬁxed IP-based infrastructural backbones, total Internet/electricity coverage,\n\
    and highly complex graph-based and centralized routing protocols [1,10,11,14,18,19],\n\
    leading to a lack of global signiﬁcance because Africa, which is the focus of\
    \ this study,\nhas less than 50% electricity/Internet coverage [27]. Also, ZigBee,\
    \ Wi-Fi and cellular-\nbased communication technologies with centralized or ﬂooding-based\
    \ routing archi-\ntecture [1,10,11,14,18,19] are capital-intensive, complex to\
    \ manage, location-restricted,\nenergy-inefﬁcient, and over-reliant on ﬁxed supporting\
    \ infrastructure. Therefore,\nan in-depth contextual assessment of how low-power\
    \ communication standards such\nas LoRa, SigFox, and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\
    \ evolve in cluster-based Agri-IoT\n(CA-IoT) networks can be of immeasurable beneﬁts\
    \ to the IoT community and farmers.\n5.\nThe role of Agri-IoT in eliminating food\
    \ insecurity, improving crop quality, alle-\nviating global poverty, and increasing\
    \ agricultural production volumes has been\nunderestimated [2,7,8,10,16,28,29].\
    \ The agricultural sector, which has been hindered\nby climate change, is the\
    \ largest global employer [3]. To revitalize this sector, CA-IoT\nhas emerged\
    \ with the most promising opportunities to address food and employ-\nment insecurity\
    \ issues and improve crop quality and economic conditions for the\nfarmers. However,\
    \ these beneﬁts have not been fully realized due to insufﬁcient\nresearch publicity.\n\
    To the best of our knowledge, no survey or tutorial articles have sufﬁciently\
    \ consid-\nered these technical issues and provided sufﬁcient technical guidelines\
    \ for the designers of\nAgri-IoT systems to make well-informed decisions in order\
    \ to achieve satisfactory network\nperformance. Additional realistic research\
    \ is needed regarding the contextual evaluation\nof SN design and deployment factors,\
    \ fundamental network design concepts and require-\nments, multi-objective optimization\
    \ (MOO) analysis of the parameters for designing the\nassociated routing protocol,\
    \ and efﬁcient operational metrics of the WSN sublayer of the\nAgri-IoT using\
    \ the cluster-based architecture. In addition, the assessment of the possibil-\n\
    ity of using low-power and accessible wireless communication technologies such\
    \ as BLE\nvia cluster-based architecture to achieve a complete infrastructure-less,\
    \ cheaper, energy-\nefﬁcient, self-healing, adaptive, and robust Agri-IoT network\
    \ is imperative. Furthermore,\na broader contextual overview covering all vital\
    \ aspects such as the fundamental concepts\nof Agri-IoT, technical design requirements\
    \ of SNs and WSN-based Agri-IoT, surveys of the\nbenchmarking communication standards,\
    \ routing protocols, and testbed solutions, and an\nin-depth case study on how\
    \ to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, adaptive, and CA-IoT\nbased on the\
    \ performance and users expectations are illustrated in Figure 2. Such a refer-\n\
    ence document can help support researchers when they attempt to accurately model\
    \ and\noptimize the performance of Agri-IoT [14] so that the performance gap between\
    \ the simu-\nlated networks and the realized Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1] can\
    \ be addressed. By way of\naddressing these technical challenges, this tutorial\
    \ presents the following contributions:\n•\nPerform an in-depth synthesis and\
    \ review (1) the basic concepts of Agri-IoT, (2) the\ncomprehensive design considerations\
    \ of these networks, (3) the technical design re-\nIoT 2023, 4\n269\nquirements\

    \ root faults and possible remedies in the WSN sublayer, derive a generalized\n\
    taxonomy of routing architectures, and deﬁne appropriate routing paradigms for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT using the core PHY layer design metrics: affordability, self-\n\
    healing capacity, energy-efﬁciency, location independence, and network adaptability.\n\
    •\nSystematic synthesis of canon cluster-based routing protocols to uncover the\
    \ plethora\nof possible research gaps, derive a realistic taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ and propose\npossible MOO remedies that can be implemented using CA-IoT routing\

    \ designers to build adaptive, robust, fault-tolerant, energy-efﬁcient, affordable,\n\
    and optimized CA-IoT networks in both simulation and real-world implementations.\n\
    Overall, this tutorial is motivated to provide a contextualized, in-depth understanding\n\
    of this technology and assist the reader in designing robust, affordable, and\
    \ optimized Agri-\nIoT networks that can act as reliable game-changers to avert\
    \ the stipulated challenges. Also,\nthe critical design, deployment, and QoS requirements\
    \ of WSN-based Agri-IoT networks\nfrom theoretical modeling to real-world deployment\
    \ are unveiled in order to bridge the\nexisting gap between the theory and practice\
    \ of this technology [1,14].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized into the\
    \ following sections: Section 2\nprovides a brief background comparative overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT technologies,\nwhile Section 3 focuses on their components,\
    \ protocols, architectural layers, and proposed\narchitectural layers for WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT technology. Section 4 presents the detailed\ncontextual design and\
    \ implementation requirements of Agri-IoT networks, while Section V\ndeduces the\
    \ unique characteristics, challenges, and proposed performance expectations of\n\
    the associated routing protocols for the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. Sections 6–8\
    \ present\nsystematic surveys on routing protocols, FM techniques, and the canon\
    \ real-world testbed\nimplementations of WSN-based Agri-IoT solutions. Section\
    \ 9 examines how the above\ndiscussions have evolved using a case study of cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) for precision\nirrigation.Section 10 unveils open issues and\
    \ future works, while Section 11 concludes\nthe paper.\n1.1. Comparative Overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT Technologies\nA comparative overview of the underlying\
    \ technologies (i.e., WSN, IoT, and Agri-\nIoT) forming the WSN-based Agri-IoT\
    \ are compared from the perspective of architectural\nvariations, users’ expectations,\
    \ and design and implementational differences in Table 1.\nAs depicted in Figure\
    \ 3, WSNs are formed by spatially distributed, autonomous,\nresource-constrained\
    \ SNs that wirelessly interconnect to communicate their sampled data\nto a BS\
    \ for further monitoring or event tracking purposes without necessarily requiring\n\
    the Internet. The main components of the WSN are the SNs, the BS/gateway, and\
    \ the\nevent sampling/routing software that supervises the entire network process.\
    \ A node\nmay route data directly or via relay SNs to the BS based on its location\
    \ and assigned\ntasks. The BS locally takes actionable decisions and execution\
    \ of the actuation actions.\nAlthough the WSNs are resource-constrained and fault-vulnerable,\
    \ they constitute the\ninevitable part of this technology [2] and the underlying\
    \ innovation of the WSN-based\nAgri-IoT framework. In contrast, classic IoT consists\
    \ of IoT devices that sense and transmit\ntheir sampled information directly or\
    \ via telemetry to the Internet for monitoring or event-\ntracking purposes, mostly\
    \ via the centralized routing architecture. Like BS in WSNs, IoT\ndevices can\
    \ connect to the Internet/IoT cloud via ﬁxed-line (thus, for a factory), 5G/4G/LTE\n\
    cellular/mobile networks, or Wi-Fi for further processing, storage, and decisions/actions.\n\

    The main hardware components of an Agri-IoT framework, as presented in Figure\
    \ 3\nand Table 2, include the WSN (i.e., comprising the ﬁeld-deployed SNs or IoT\
    \ devices),\na base station (BS) or gateway or actuator controller, cloud servers,\
    \ and the user’s monitor-\ning/control devices. The on-farm participants (e.g.,\
    \ SNs and BS) in Agri-IoT are mostly\nbattery-powered and must be equipped with\
    \ sensing, computing, and communication\nabilities to form infrastructure-less,\
    \ robust, self-healing, and self-conﬁgured WSNs for data\ncollection and event\
    \ management [33]. The core units of the SNs in Figure 3c and the BS\nare compared\
    \ and contrasted in Table 2. As the framework in Figure 3a depicts, the IoT\n\
    devices can sense, process, and transmit their sampled data directly to the Internet\
    \ or IoT\ncloud without a gateway, whereas the SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT perform\
    \ likewise via\na BS. This resource-sufﬁcient BS interfaces between the IoT cloud/user\
    \ and the WSN or\nactuator control system. It can also process the received data\
    \ and locally execute actionable\ndecisions via the actuator of the farm event\
    \ being monitored. The received data can also be\nrelayed to the analytical data\
    \ engines in the IoT cloud via a wired and wireless medium for\nfurther processing\
    \ and actions [13]. The resource-constrained WSN sublayer mainly uses\ndata-centric\
    \ protocols due to the SNs’ high deployment densities, high network dynamics,\n\
    and limited power supply of SNs. Although data-centric protocols are fragile and\
    \ not\nstandardized, they are more suitable than the high resource-demanding ID-based\
    \ IPv4 or\nIPv6 protocols in the addressing space of the WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n\

    \ WSN and IoT technologies into contextualized intelligent farm\nmanagement systems\
    \ to achieve higher event data quality and offer remote monitoring\nand control.\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT consists of the WSN sublayer, the gateways, the cloud\nservers,\
    \ and the remote interface application, as illustrated in Figures 3a and 5. Uniquely,\n\
    the current trends of Agri-IoT mandate that both intra-SN and BS–cloud communication\n\
    are based on low-power, ubiquitous, and freely available wireless standards [2].\
    \ Also,\nmost Agri-IoT solutions support bidirectional communications between\
    \ the BS/gateway\nand the cloud/users, whereby the BS updates the cloud/user database\
    \ and receives ac-\ntionable/control remote messages from the user or cloud analytical\
    \ decision results for\nactuation purposes. The WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most\
    \ dominant technology in the global\nsmart farming use cases in the agricultural\
    \ sector. The core tasks of SNs in a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT application, which are\
    \ frequently supervised by the associated routing protocol,\ninclude network construction/management,\
    \ data sensing, data processing/aggregation,\nfault tolerance, and communication\
    \ [9,12]. Also, the routing architecture must be supported\nby the associated\
    \ communication platform and the application-speciﬁc requirements of\nthe network.\n\

    \ WSN-based\nAgri-IoT requires holistic integrations of the expectations in Figure\
    \ 2.\n1.2. Classiﬁcations of IoT Applications and Speciﬁc Roles of Agri-IoT\n\
    Generally, IoT technology is application-speciﬁc. However, it has limitless applications\n\
    and roles in the smart world agenda. Based on their intended purpose, WSN-based\
    \ IoT sys-\ntems can be broadly classiﬁed into condition monitoring and event-tracking\
    \ categories [34],\nas illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe monitoring-based applications\
    \ involve real-time event data collection and analysis,\nsupervision, and operational\
    \ control of systems. In contrast, tracking-based applications\ntrack changes\
    \ in the phenomenon of interest, such as the locations of objects, persons,\n\
    transported goods, animals, and vehicles. Both application domains can be subdivided\n\
    into industrial, environmental, and societal IoT applications in Figure 6, where\
    \ speciﬁc\nexamples are provided for each application domain. For instance, monitoring-based\
    \ ap-\nplications may include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [6], industrial\
    \ process\nmonitoring [5,29], process control [2], greenhouse automation [7],\
    \ precision agriculture\n(e.g., irrigation management, crop disease prediction,\
    \ prediction of production quality,\nIoT 2023, 4\n274\nand pest and disease control)\
    \ [2,8], biomedical or health monitoring [8], electrical grid net-\nwork monitoring/control\
    \ [12,29], military location monitoring [9], and so forth. Conversely,\nspecific\
    \ examples of tracking-based applications may include habitat tracking, traffic\
    \ tracking,\nplant/animal condition tracking, and military target tracking, as\
    \ outlined in Figure 6.\n1/21/22, 10:55 AM\n701.svg\nEcology: Wildlife Tracking\n\

    \ \nFigure 6. Generalized taxonomy of IoT applications.\n1.3. Agri-IoT Roles and\
    \ Use-Cases\nThe concept of intelligent farming involves data acquisition, data\
    \ processing/planning,\nand smart control using the WSN and IoT technologies,\
    \ big data, and cloud computing\ntechniques to provide proﬁtable solutions, as\
    \ presented in Figure 7. These principal roles\nin Figure 7 deﬁne their use cases.\
    \ For instance, monitoring the state of crops or the\nclimate of the ﬁeld using\
    \ Agri-IoT technology can allow farmers to know precisely the\namount of pesticides,\
    \ water, and fertilizers required to attain optimal crop quality and\nproduction\
    \ volume. However, the QoS requirements, the routing techniques, architectural\n\
    requirements, and the operational dynamics differ from one use case to another.\
    \ This\ntutorial focused on the critical and unique design requirements of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT,\nwhich is the backbone of the smart agricultural initiative [35].\
    \ The resulting use-cases in\nFigure 7 can be explained as follows:\n1.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Climate Condition or Agronomical Monitoring: This Agri-IoT system mostly\n\
    comprises BS (i.e., weather stations) and a deployed WSN. The analytical data\
    \ engines\nmine the sampled climate or crop condition data in the cloud to predict\
    \ future climate\nconditions and farm automation plans. The most suitable crop\
    \ and precise farming\npractices can then be predeﬁned to improve agriculture\
    \ production capacity and\nquality.\n2.\nAgri-IoT for Precision Farming: This\
    \ is the most famous application of Agri-IoT, whereby\nfarming practices (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer application, etc.) are precisely and accu-\nrately controlled\
    \ to optimize these resources. Here, the SNs are mostly ﬁtted with soil\nsensors\
    \ to collect a vast array of microclimatic data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and salinity) that can enable farmers to estimate optimal amounts of water, fertiliz-\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n275\ners, and pesticides needed by the crops to minimize resources’\
    \ costs and produce\nhealthier crops. Additionally, the BS controls the event\
    \ actuation system via accurate\ndata-driven real-time decisions on the crops\
    \ using climate data, crop growth data,\nand disease infection data.\n3.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Greenhouse Automation: The Agri-IoT-based approach provides more accu-\n\
    rate real-time information on greenhouse conditions, such as lighting, temperature,\n\
    soil condition, and humidity, unlike manual greenhouse management. This allows\n\
    precise remote monitoring and control or automation of all farming practices.\n\
    4.\nAgri-IoT for Livestock Monitoring and Management: In this system, SNs are\
    \ attached\nto livestock to monitor their real-time health, track their physical\
    \ location, and log\ntheir performance. This helps the farmer identify and isolate\
    \ sick animals to avoid\ncontamination and reduce stafﬁng expenses.\n5.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Predictive Analytics: This Agri-IoT system provides highly relevant real-\n\
    time data that can be analyzed to make essential predictions, such as crop harvesting\n\
    time, risk of disease infection, yield volume, yield quality, and yield vulnerability,\n\
    for proper planning.\n6.\nAgricultural Drones (Agri-Drones): Agri-Drones, such\
    \ as DroneSeed, are ﬁtted with\nmobile SNs and farming tools to collect agricultural\
    \ data or perform activities such\nas ﬁeld surveillance, crop planting, pest control,\
    \ farm spraying, crop monitoring, etc.\nFor example, for Agri-Drones, all the\
    \ above use cases utilize the WSN-based Agri-IoT\nframework.\n1/21/22, 11:01 AM\n\

    \ established that the existing real-world attempts of Agri-IoT could\nnot meet\
    \ both performance and user users’ expectations because they are founded on the\n\
    fundamental concepts and the operational principles of classic IoT and WSN technologies.\n\
    To effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative to conduct\
    \ a systematic\nassessment of the related architectural layers in classic IoT\
    \ and propose a suitable option for\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem. Generally,\
    \ the conventional IoT ecosystem consists\nof the network architectural layers\
    \ and the data management platforms [2,7,8], which\nare further grouped into devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators, and gateways/BS), network (BS to\ncloud), platforms/applications’\
    \ cloud, and agents/users. Due to the domain-speciﬁc\nrequirements of IoT applications\
    \ and the incorporation of numerous heterogeneous devices\nIoT 2023, 4\n276\n\
    with application-speciﬁc requirements, there are generally no uniﬁed or standardized\n\
    IoT architectural layers. Therefore, most application-defined layers are frequently\
    \ adapted\nfrom the canon architectural layers, which include the three-layer\
    \ [5], the cloud-based [7],\nthe service-oriented architecture (SOA) [2,7], and\
    \ the fog-based [2,7,29], as illustrated in\nFigure 8.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n714.svg\n\

    \ in the state of the art of IoT ecosystem.\nThe fog-based architecture was adapted\
    \ from the three-layer parent architecture to in-\nclude cloud computing by offering\
    \ computing, storage, and network information between\nthe clients and the cloud\
    \ services [29] in a decentralized manner. Here, cloud computing\nand fog/edge\
    \ computing architectures only differ in where data computing occurs. These\n\
    layers are not uniﬁed because the respective network layers do not cover all underlying\n\
    technologies that transfer data to all IoT platforms [5]. Additionally, they are\
    \ based on com-\nplicated centralized and ﬂooding-based routing architectures,\
    \ high-resource-demanding\nand capital-intensive Wi-Fi/cellular-based communication\
    \ technologies. As well, they\nrequire wired infrastructural support in the farm,\
    \ which is too complex, location-restricted,\nand capital-intensive for most low-income\
    \ and non-expert farmers to implement and\nmanage. Consequently, they are unsuitable\
    \ candidates for the resource-constrained SNs\nin WSN-based Agri-IoT. By implication,\
    \ there are no reference guidelines for designing\nAgri-IoT participants and supervisory\
    \ protocols, controlling the speed of packet delivery,\nsmoothing out SN’s integration,\
    \ unifying technology, and creating standardized Agri-\nIoT reference models,\
    \ among other considerations. In contrast, an Agri-IoT ecosystem,\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 3, consists of:\n1.\nAgri-IoT network architectural layers: This shows\
    \ how the physical network elements,\nnetwork operation principles, and operational\
    \ techniques interact throughout the\nentire ecosystem.\n2.\nNetwork supervisory\
    \ software/routing protocol and routing architectures: This con-\ntains the virtual\
    \ arrangement of multiple network elements [8] and the event sam-\npling/routing\
    \ protocol that constructs the routing architecture, supervises sampling\nand\
    \ moderates all communications in the PHY layer.\n3.\nData management platform:\
    \ It hosts all high-resource-demanding data analytic en-\ngines, event databases,\
    \ and remote control algorithms in a cloud model.\n2.1. Proposed Architectural\
    \ Layers for WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nIn designing an efﬁcient Agri-IoT system of global\
    \ signiﬁcance, it is imperative to\npropose suitable architectural layers and\
    \ evaluate how the various components interact in\nthese layers. With the emerging\
    \ advances in low-power, freely available, and boundless\ncommunication standards\
    \ (e.g., BLE) and unfulﬁlled potentials of CA-IoT network [12,16],\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n277\na new framework of cluster-based architectural layers for the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT ecosys-\ntem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5. The center portion\
    \ of Figure 5 presents the key\ncomponents/technologies required in each layer,\
    \ while the Things taxonomies of hardware\ncomponents from the related literature\
    \ [4,8,29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5.\nThe underlying layers\
    \ in our four-tier layers in Figure 5 can be elaborated on as follows:\n1.\nIntegrated\
    \ Application and Management Layer: This operates all agriculture-related\napplications\
    \ that interface between the user (for example, farmer) and the Agri-IoT\nsystem\
    \ to make decisions and execute remote actions to keep their crops or animals\n\
    healthy. This layer manages the entire Agri-IoT system and its application-speciﬁc\n\
    functionality, high-resource-demanding applications, and core business model in\
    \ the\ncloud. This layer’s security requirements are crucial to the next sublayer;\
    \ however,\nthese are beyond the scope of this research. The business or management\
    \ sublayer\nmaintains end-to-end data integrity and security by ensuring that\
    \ data are transferred\nto the correct user. It also ensures that the correct\
    \ user executes the actuation.\n2.\nInformation Management Layer: This handles\
    \ data processing, storage, and other special-\nized cloud services and functionality\
    \ that make precise, actionable decisions. In Agri-\nIoT, the sensory data are\
    \ preprocessed locally to optimize communication power\nbut can be further processed\
    \ using analytic engines in the cloud for better decision\nmaking and remote monitoring\
    \ and control. This layer can be embedded in the above\napplication layers and\
    \ hosted in the cloud in a typical Agri-IoT ecosystem.\n3.\nNetwork Management\
    \ Layer: This layer discovers, connects, and translates devices over\na network,\
    \ and it coordinates with the above application layers. It also contains the\n\
    BS, which interfaces the resource-constrained WSN and cloud information network.\n\
    By convention, the WSN sublayer must utilize low-power communication standards\n\
    such as Zigbee, SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Z-Wave, SigFox, and IEEE P802.11ah (low-power\n\
    Wi-Fi), while the BS-to-Cloud connectivity can be achieved via the traditional\
    \ cellular\nnetworks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, LAN, WAN, and LoRa, among others.\
    \ Unlike clas-\nsic IoT, Agri-IoT requires that the BS-to-Cloud connectivity utilize\
    \ low-power commu-\nnication standards. Also, since every communication standard\
    \ for the resource-limited\nWSN sublayer comes with unique resource speciﬁcations\
    \ and design tradeoffs be-\ntween power consumption, routing architectural constraints,\
    \ and bandwidth [4,14,17],\nthe best connectivity option must be selected to achieve\
    \ the desired application goals.\nConsequently, the stated WSN-based connectivity\
    \ technologies can be classiﬁed using\nseveral distinct parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption rates, uplink/downlink data\nrates, packet size, SN-count per BS\
    \ (gateway), network routing topology, the SNs’\nsensing range, the SNs’ transmitter/receiver\
    \ power, frequency bandwidth, channel\nwidth, etc. (refer to the right portion\
    \ of Figure 5).\n4.\nPhysical/Perception/Things Layer: This layer refers to the\
    \ ﬁeld and all devices such as\nSNs, actuators, RFID tags, sensors, and edge devices\
    \ that interact with the environment.\nThis layer senses and collects the necessary\
    \ information from the connected devices in\nthe WSN sublayer to the BS. In Agri-IoT\
    \ networks, the sampled microclimatic data\ncan be processed and stored on the\
    \ local BS, the cloud, or both. The activities in the\ncloud or application layers\
    \ are beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n2.2. Associated Hardware Components\
    \ and Technologies Required in the Proposed Architectural Layers\nTo precisely\
    \ model and design an Agri-IoT network of desired expectations (refer to\nFigure\
    \ 2) using the proposed architectural layers shown in Figure 5, the knowledge\
    \ of the\nprincipal components and technologies used in each of these layers and\
    \ how they interact\nand adapt for their intended functions is imperative. As\
    \ depicted in the middle of Figure 5,\nthe Agri-IoT ecosystem is composed of the\
    \ following core components/technologies:\n1.\nThings: The Things unit is the\
    \ physical interface between the tracked/monitored asset\nand the BS or actuator\
    \ controller, which aligns with the physical or perception layer. It\ncomprises\
    \ the monitored/tracked asset (for example, ﬁeld, crop, or animal), the SNs,\n\
    or the entire IoT devices making up the WSN (for example, SNs, actuators, IoT-enabled\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n278\ndevices, WSNs, and other smart devices), the event sampling,\
    \ and routing technology\nin the WSN. Since the SNs constituting this unit are\
    \ resource-constrained, freely\navailable communication standards such as Zigbee,\
    \ BLE, Z-Wave, and IEEE P802.11ah\n(low-power Wi-Fi) are the most suitable for\
    \ both SN–SN and SN–BS communications.\nThe Things unit accesses the cloud/Internet\
    \ via gateways (BS).\n2.\nGateway (BS): The BS interfaces the WSN out in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the applications situated\nin the cloud servers. This unit aligns with the\
    \ network management and actuator\ncontrol layer shown in the middle of Figure\
    \ 5. The WSN sublayer may have more\nthan one BS(s), each with the capacity to\
    \ handle most resource-demanding com-\nputational tasks besides actuation execution,\
    \ network construction, scheduling of\nevent sampling, and network supervision\
    \ services. They may also allow bidirectional\ncommunication with the cloud/user\
    \ and WSN. Similar to standalone IoT devices,\nthe BS can be equipped with 4G/5G/LTE/NB-IoT,\
    \ cellular-based, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN,\nor wired ethernet communication technologies\
    \ to interact with the cloud, and low-\npower communication standards such as\
    \ LoRa, low-power Wi-Fi, SIGFOX, UMTS,\nBLE, and Zigbee (Figure 5) to communicate\
    \ with the sensor ﬁeld. However, Agri-IoT\nnetworks require that both upper-layer\
    \ and lower-layer communication technolo-\ngies of the BS should be low-power,\
    \ freely available, easy to deploy and manage,\nand platform-independent. The\
    \ BS may preprocess or relay the raw data to the cloud\nfor remote data processing.\
    \ The BS(s) locations are strategically chosen to optimize\nnetwork communication\
    \ costs.\n3.\nIoT Cloud: The Cloud unit aligns with the applications layer. It\
    \ consists of an on-\npremises or remote server farm that hosts the applications\
    \ layer, event data analytic\nengines, security protocols, robust IoT applications,\
    \ user interface, and event database.\nThe high resource-demanding data-processing\
    \ tasks are mostly executed by well-\nequipped cloud-hosted applications to manage\
    \ and store huge amounts of data,\nprovide monitoring and data analytical services,\
    \ enable communication with devices,\nand manage information access. The merits\
    \ of edge computing can be exploited to\nensure that large amounts of data are\
    \ post-processed off-device to reduce the response\ntimes of the cloud.\n4.\n\
    User Interface: With the aid of a web or mobile app, the user or farmer can live-\n\
    monitor the farm’s conditions and execute control actions. Additionally, a presentation\n\
    or business intelligence layer may be added to coordinate the activities of non-technical\n\
    business users through dashboards and reports rather than with the application\n\
    layer itself.\n2.3. Quality Expectations of Agri-IoT’s Architectural Layers\n\
    Although there is no uniﬁed, certiﬁed, and ﬂexible Agri-IoT architecture layer,\
    \ any\nsuitable options deduced from the benchmarking architectures in Figure\
    \ 8 must satisfy\ncertain quality requirements, including:\n1.\nSimultaneous data\
    \ acquisition, analysis, and control from many sensors or actuators.\n2.\nMinimization\
    \ of huge raw data transmissions via data aggregation techniques to\nmaximize\
    \ actionable information quality.\n3.\nProvision of reliable network architecture\
    \ that supports energy-efﬁcient routing, sta-\nble connectivity, self-adaptability,\
    \ fault tolerance, operational simplicity/ﬂexibility,\nplatform independence,\
    \ affordability, and location independence of Agri-IoT designs.\n4.\nSupport for\
    \ automated/remote device management and updates.\n5.\nEasy integration of each\
    \ layer with existing applications and other IoT solutions via\nspeciﬁed APIs.\n\
    6.\nUtilization of freely available, location-unrestricted, cheap, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ and simple\nto deploy and manage by non-experts [4,29] underlying communication\
    \ technologies\nin the PHY and network layers as well as based on open standards\
    \ to guarantee\ninteroperability.\nIoT 2023, 4\n279\n3. Design and Implementation\
    \ of Agri-IoT Networks\nDespite the technical challenges associated with the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT, its potential\ncontributions in the agricultural sector largely surpass\
    \ the least complex, capital-intensive,\npure IoT-based solutions, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3b and 7. Due to the broader applicability\nand higher signiﬁcance\
    \ of the WSN-based Agri-IoT networks relative to the classic IoT\nnetworks, this\
    \ study focuses on the former technology whose design and implementation\ninvolve\
    \ four crucial phases, namely:\n1.\nCustom-building of robust, affordable, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ location-independent, and\nadaptive SNs and a BS that can form an infrastructure-less\
    \ and easily manageable WSN.\nThe SNs and the BS must consist of cost-effective,\
    \ architecture-deﬁned, and context-\ndeﬁned components so that the system operates\
    \ stably and efﬁciently, becomes afford-\nable to farmers, and easily integrates\
    \ to any real-world scenario without any expensive,\nﬁxed/wired backbone connections.\
    \ The low-power capabilities of the SNs help to\neasily integrate them into any\
    \ precision farms and greenhouses to operate over the\nentire crop season without\
    \ many technical hindrances.\n2.\nPhysical deployment of the SNs in the ﬁeld,\
    \ selection of the WSN’s communication\ntechnology, and design of a suitable supervisory\
    \ protocol to coordinate the construc-\ntion of appropriate event routing architecture,\
    \ the duty-cycle schedule of event sam-\npling to the BS, fault management, data\
    \ management, and network maintenance.\nAdditionally, a range of techniques such\
    \ as network participant mobility, cross-layer\ndesign, MAC techniques, data aggregation,\
    \ self-healing techniques, nodes’ duty-cycle\nschedule, security measures, localization,\
    \ and communication speciﬁcations of the\nSNs can also be exploited in the associated\
    \ routing protocols.\n3.\nSelection of appropriate BS/gateway communication technology\
    \ and design of a\nsuitable higher protocol to update the cloud database and execute\
    \ the actuation\nactions based on users’ requests or decisions on processed event\
    \ data.\n4.\nDesign of data analytical engines and applications in the cloud and\
    \ users’ remote\nmonitoring and control interface app, which is beyond the scope\
    \ of this tutorial.\nThese call for a systematic application-speciﬁc assessment\
    \ of the hardware components\nselected for every use case.\n3.1. Sensor Nodes\
    \ Design Considerations\nAs illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3, a node for\
    \ the WSN-based Agri-IoT network\nconsists of four main units, which include the\
    \ following:\n1.\nSensing Unit: This unit interfaces with the physical environment\
    \ and records the\nphysical phenomenon of interest. The type of sensor is application-speciﬁc\
    \ and can\nbe contact-based or non-contact-based. For instance, the STEMMA soil\
    \ moisture\nsensor and the DHT22 sensor can be used to sample environmental temperature\
    \ and\nhumidity (refer to Figure 3c).\n2.\nController Unit: This unit hosts the\
    \ processor, storage, and connection pins for the\nother units and all auxiliary\
    \ peripherals. The suitable controllers for building Agri-IoT\nSNs are Arduino-based\
    \ and Raspberry-Pi-based (refer to the bottom of Figure 3) due\nto their ability\
    \ to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, other off-the-shelf,\napplication-speciﬁc\
    \ controllers such as the ProPlant Seed Rate Controller, John Deere\nGreenStar\
    \ Rate Controller, Viper Pro multi-function ﬁeld computer, Radion 8140,\nTrimble\
    \ Field-IQ, etc. are also available.\n3.\nCommunication Unit: This unit is the\
    \ principal determinant of the node’s power\nconsumption, operational stability,\
    \ and affordability, as well as the routing architecture\nin the associated supervisory\
    \ protocol. The bottom of Figure 3 shows the available\ncommunication technologies,\
    \ but an Agri-IoT-based SN demands an energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, freely available,\
    \ simple, and reliable communication standard. Conse-\nquently, LoRa, BLE, ZigBee,\
    \ LoRaWan, and SigFox are the best candidates based on\nIoT 2023, 4\n280\nthe\
    \ support of the routing architecture of the resulting WSN, but the selection\
    \ must be\njustiﬁed from the technology requirement metrics via a decision matrix.\n\
    4.\nPower Unit: Since the SNs are mostly battery-powered, the appropriate battery\
    \ size\nand probable energy-harvesting techniques must be determined during the\
    \ SNs’\ndesign according to the intended network lifespan and stability requirements.\
    \ Modern\ntrends in battery power banks with integrated solar-based energy-harvesting\
    \ systems\nand power ratings above 30,000 Ah are available.\nWhen selecting hardware\
    \ components, adequate caution should be taken to avoid unit\nincompatibility,\
    \ high operational complexities, unsuitable operational thresholds, and high\n\
    energy consumption, among others. This implies that high component survivability\
    \ and op-\nerational stability under different environmental conditions and the\
    \ application speciﬁcities\nare vital to monitor.\n3.2. Wireless Spectrum and\

    \ (EM) spectrum, which has invisible, ﬁnite radio fre-\nquencies for wireless\

    (ISM) frequency band (e.g., Bluetooth classic, BLE, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRaWAN)\
    \ is an\nunlicensed microwave frequency band clustered around 2.4 GHz and globally\

    \ SNs and Designing the Supervisory\nSampling/Routing Protocol\nAfter custom-building\
    \ or selecting off-the-shelf SNs, the next activity is to deploy\nthe SNs on the\
    \ ﬁeld and design a contextualized supervisory protocol to coordinate the\naforementioned\
    \ network’s activities. The SNs’ deployment in the ﬁeld can be either random\n\
    or deterministic. Both options require different methods to optimize the resulting\
    \ network’s\nperformance. For instance, under the deterministic approach, the\
    \ optimal parameters such\nas node uniformity and density must be predeﬁned based\
    \ on the distance thresholds of the\nassociated communication technology (i.e.,\
    \ connectivity/distance range), the SNs’ resource\noptimization mechanisms, the\
    \ type of routing architecture, and the sensing range of the\nphysical parameter\
    \ to be measured. Since communication is the principal power consumer,\nthe best\
    \ ways to conserve power are to minimize communication distance and data sizes\
    \ as\nwell as operate the SNs in the appropriate sleep–active duty cycles using\
    \ a cluster-based\nrouting architecture [9,24,26].\nBeyond the physical installation\
    \ of the SNs at their most suitable in-range locations,\nthe remaining activities,\
    \ such as network construction, event sensing, data management, FM,\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n281\nnetwork maintenance, sleep–active duty-cycle scheduling of SNs for sampling,\
    \ network adapt-\nability to turbulent and scalable conditions, power-optimization\
    \ mechanisms, and network\nreconfiguration, among others, are controlled by the\
    \ associated routing protocol [12,16,17,26,36].\nThis places crucial merits on\
    \ the physical locations of the SNs in the ﬁeld, thorough synthe-\nsis of network\
    \ design factors, and assessment of available routing architectures/techniques,\n\
    since this protocol manages all post-deployment tasks. This can be summarized\
    \ into\nthe core objectives of the routing protocol and its architecture, which\
    \ include power op-\ntimization, self-healing of any faults without the obstruction\
    \ of its normal operation,\nand self-adaptability to all turbulent and scalable\
    \ conditions. From the analysis above,\nwe can derive the critical primary factors\
    \ to consider when designing a routing protocol\nfor Agri-IoT networks, which\
    \ are presented in Figure 9 and grouped into the following\ncategories: SNs speciﬁcations,\
    \ security issues, application-speciﬁc factors, communication\nstandard compatibility\
    \ and capacities, and other auxiliary factors. At the PHY layer level,\nwhich\
    \ is the focus of this tutorial, these critical factors can translate into the\
    \ stipulated core\ndesign objectives, which can be addressed via phase-based multi-objective\
    \ optimization\n(MOO) formulation frameworks [12,23,24,37].\n1/21/22, 10:18 AM\n\

    \ 2023, 4\n283\nCost or Affordability of the Resulting Agri-IoT System: In addition\
    \ to being\ninfrastructure-less, ﬂexible, self-healing, adaptive, and energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT must consist of cost-effective hardware and software components\
    \ so that the\nsystem is affordable for farmers, since existing real-world solutions\
    \ are too expensive and\ncomplicated [1,14]. Additionally, the installation, operational,\
    \ and maintenance costs of\nthe resulting WSN-based Agri-IoT network must be kept\
    \ to a minimum so that it can be\neasily acquired.\nSecurity Issues in Agri-IoT:\
    \ Security is still a challenge in classic IoT systems that\nhandle sensitive\
    \ information, especially during cloud communications. Although Agri-\nIoT networks\
    \ lack the requisite resource capacities in most large-scale, broadcast-based,\n\
    distributed, and infrastructure-less WSN systems to achieve adequate data conﬁdentiality,\n\
    authenticity, integrity, and other security requirements, the security of the\
    \ agricultural\ndata is rarely a priority [2,4]. Nevertheless, the associated\
    \ routing architecture, such as\nthe clustering architecture, has an embedded\
    \ capacity to resolve on-site security issues.\nIn addition, both on-site and\
    \ remote information access types (e.g., via a smartphone or\ndesktop computer)\
    \ must be selected based on solid internal infrastructure and security\nprecautions\
    \ to secure unwanted access to sensitive information.\nThe Application-Speciﬁc\
    \ Factors: As indicated in Figure 9, the application-deﬁned\nfactors vary based\
    \ on the Agri-IoT application, the ﬁeld settings, network maintenance prac-\n\
    tices, intended event routing architecture, and network participants’ mobility,\
    \ among other\nfactors. However, the routing protocol must incorporate all relevant\
    \ operational efﬁciency\nfactors of the routing software design objectives. Since\
    \ the collected ﬁeld data itself cannot\nmake sense without using analytic data\
    \ engines and predictive algorithms in machine learn-\ning, the BS or the application\
    \ layer in the cloud should deﬁne appropriate data-processing\nframeworks to obtain\
    \ accurate, actionable decisions from the collected data.\nCommunication Standards\
    \ of Agri-IoT Devices: The power-constrained WSN sub-\nlayer of Agri-IoT network\
    \ places hard restrictions on operational states of SNs’ radio\ntransceivers,\
    \ code space, and processing cycles as well as memory capacities of SNs to\nenhance\
    \ power savings [9,12,23]. The type of communication technology selected for a\n\
    typical Agri-IoT is the principal predictor of its routing architecture, affordability,\
    \ simplicity,\nadaptability, power-saving capacity, location independence, self-healing\
    \ capacity, and event\ndata quality [12,16]. Consequently, power and routing architectural\
    \ limitations constrain\nthe network design requirements. Despite the aforementioned\
    \ technical challenges on\nthe network’s operational efﬁciency, interconnected\
    \ SNs that form the WSN are expected\nto withstand extra operational disruptions\
    \ caused by unfavorable weather conditions in\nthe ﬁeld [2,4]. Consequently, the\
    \ de facto PHY-layer communication standards for this\nlow-power, low bandwidth,\
    \ and distance-limited communication Agri-IoT devices/SNs\nhave been the energy-efﬁcient\
    \ platforms such as BLE, LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Also, a suit-\nable MAC technique\
    \ is imperative in the routing architecture to curb all channel access\nchallenges.\
    \ For instance, the ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard focuses on the physical and\n\
    the MAC layer speciﬁcations for WSNs, and it also supports the sleep–active or\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduled operation modes of SNs to enhance energy savings in centralized\
    \ or mesh-based\narchitectures. BLE does likewise in the highly endowed cluster-based\
    \ routing architecture.\nConsequently, Agri-IoT network designers must make the\
    \ most appropriate and critical de-\ncisions regarding the network’s communication\
    \ requirements when designing the routing\nprotocol. Using Table 4, WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT designers can make realistic design decisions\nregarding energy-efﬁcient\
    \ multihop routing, architectural requirements of routing proto-\ncol, bandwidth,\
    \ routing table capacities, total communication cost, and the desired MAC\ntechnique.\
    \ Additionally, the physical conditions within the agricultural environment such\n\
    as atmospheric dust concentration, physical obstruction to wireless signal transmissions,\n\
    and the terrain need to be considered.\nAuxiliary Factors and Available Software\
    \ Tool: Finally, the auxiliary factors can be\nnon-exhaustive depending on the\
    \ designer’s ﬁnancial capacity, user interface, information\nrequisition model,\
    \ cloud activities, operational expectations, and the available software\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n284\ntools. Additionally, an assortment of PHY-Layer design software\
    \ tools for Agri-IoT exper-\niments (thus, in both simulations and real-world\
    \ testbed deployments) that can be used\ninclude NS-3 [9,38], OMNeT++, MATLAB/Simulink\
    \ [9,12,39], Python [16], PAWiS [39],\nGloMoSim/QualNet [39,40], OPNET [12,39],\
    \ SENSE [37,39], J-Sim [39], Ptolemy II [39],\nShawn [9,39], and PiccSIM [12,39,41],\
    \ among others. The key features that are frequently\nconsidered when selecting\
    \ any of these software platforms include Python or MAT-\nLAB/Simulink compatibility\
    \ for software model and hardware prototype integration\nduring real-world operation,\
    \ compatibility with low-power communication standards\n(e.g., BLE, LoRa, ZigBee,\
    \ and SIGFOX), operating system support, programming lan-\nguage implementation,\
    \ the density of simultaneously simulated or ﬁeld-deployed SNs,\nco-simulation\
    \ with other hardware, documentation, easy access to upgraded versions,\nand installation\
    \ challenges [39]. MATLAB/Simulink and Python are the most commonly\nused experimental\
    \ tools, since these software tools are well-equipped with the stipu-\nlated features.\n\
    4. Unique Characteristics and Challenges of WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nUnlike the\
    \ traditional IoT, which generally relies on ﬁxed hardware to route network\n\
    trafﬁc, a WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT combines automated sensing, computation, actua-\n\
    tion, and wireless communication tasks into the SNs that are spatially distributed\
    \ across\nthe farm to autonomously form an infrastructure-less WSN [31]. A node\
    \ may perform\nadditional tasks such as local data processing (data aggregation),\
    \ network construction,\ndata redundancy, error control, data routing (e.g., in\
    \ multihop networks), and network\nmaintenance practices based on the network\
    \ size, application speciﬁcity, and associated\nrouting techniques. Also, the\
    \ WSN can be equipped to observe heterogeneous conditions\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ humidity, sound, color, location, light, vibration, and motion, using a\nwide\
    \ variety of sensors contained within a task-scalable SN. Therefore, assuming\
    \ that the\naccuracy and precision of event data in upper layers are preserved,\
    \ the Agri-IoT’s lifespan\nand its operational efﬁciency are rooted in the WSN’s\
    \ robustness. Thus, a deeper contextual\nexegesis into the design and maintenance\
    \ of this sublayer is imperative. As opposed to con-\nventional IoT and wireless\
    \ ad hoc communication networks, the operational efﬁciency of\nthe WSN sublayer,\
    \ as well as Agri-IoT, hinge upon some application-speciﬁc characteristics\nand\
    \ resource-constrained factors such as:\n•\nHigher SN Deployment Densities: Generally,\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in either a deter-\nministic or random manner to provide\
    \ the desired redundancies, spatial variability of\nsoil, topography, distributed\
    \ monitoring and processing, accurate and precise event\nreporting, and fault\
    \ tolerance. However, this mostly leads to undesirable transmission\noverlaps,\
    \ data redundancies from the simultaneous reporting of the same data, routing\n\
    interferences, and packet collisions due to connectivity issues and the coexistence\
    \ of\ncommon standards in the ISM band [42].\n•\nLimited Power Supply: The SNs\
    \ are frequently battery-powered, which does not only\nconstrain their data transmission\
    \ rate, computational capabilities, and communication\ndistance but also subjects\
    \ Agri-IoT to possible SN-out-of-service and data outlier\nfaults due to rapid\
    \ power depletion beyond certain thresholds [26,43]. Consequently,\nnetwork power\
    \ management through data-management-related, architectural-related,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters has been one of the principal research focuses\nin WSN-based IoT\
    \ applications to improve network lifetime.\n•\nFault Management (FM) (i.e., fault\
    \ detection, fault tolerance, or fault avoidance): The\nresource-constrained WSN\
    \ is highly vulnerable to faults and failures due to high\ndeployment densities\
    \ and a lack of post-deployment maintenance services [25]. Al-\nthough faults\
    \ are inevitable in Agri-IoT for the stipulated reasons, their occurrence\nrates\
    \ and effects on the network’s functionality can be minimized, avoided, or tolerated\n\
    without hindering the normal functionality of the network if the associated WSN’s\
    \ rout-\ning protocol is well-equipped with efﬁcient self-healing and fault-avoidance\
    \ (power-\nsaving) mechanisms [12].\nIoT 2023, 4\n285\n•\nSelf-Adaptability and\
    \ Scalability: Although WSNs are application-speciﬁc, the topologi-\ncal dynamism\
    \ is inevitable due to node failures, node mobility, and scalable conditions.\n\
    Therefore, the associated routing protocol and network architecture must adapt\
    \ to\nthese dynamic conditions using apt auto-reconﬁguration and reactive multihop\
    \ event\nrouting techniques [44,45].\n•\nNetwork Architecture: The underlying\
    \ routing protocol of the WSN sublayer constructs\na network architecture that\
    \ can be ﬂat, hierarchical (e.g., clustering, chain-based,\nand tree architectures)\
    \ or location-based. This routing architecture prescribes the\npossible measures\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient local data processing, network maintenance,\nscalability,\
    \ minimized communication overhead, prolonged network lifespan, and re-\nduced\
    \ network management complexities [25,36]. Therefore, a suitable network\ntopology\
    \ indirectly determines the resulting network’s ﬂexibility, scalability, reliability,\n\
    communication strategy/costs, and the quality of the reported event data [12].\n\
    •\nMostly Requires On-site Actuation: Regardless of where data are managed in\
    \ a typical\nWSN-based Agri-IoT, the actionable decision signal must be sent to\
    \ execute on-farm\nactuation.\nProposed Design Objectives of WSN-Based Routing\
    \ Protocols for Agri-IoT and\nRealization Mechanisms\nFrom the systematic evaluation\
    \ of the unique characteristics and challenges of the\nWSN sublayer, a three-tier\
    \ cluster-based framework that constitutes the condensed ex-\npected core design\
    \ objectives and their corresponding remedial strategies of WSN-based\nrouting\
    \ protocols for Agri-IoT applications is demonstrated in Figure 10. Suppose the\
    \ corre-\nsponding remedies in Figure 10 are implemented in the associated routing\
    \ protocol. In that\ncase, the desired power optimization, self-healing, and auto-adaptability\

    \ and strategies of WSN-based Agri-IoT routing protocols.\nThe importance of this\
    \ three-tier framework can be expanded on as follows:\n•\nAn adaptive and scalable\
    \ WSN-based routing protocol, as proposed in Figure 10, normally\nconstructs a\
    \ routing architecture that supports multihop routing, self-reconfiguration,\n\
    self-healing, and local network administration at a minimal routing table size,\
    \ commu-\nnication cost, and and control message complexity requirement. Since\
    \ communication\nIoT 2023, 4\n286\nis the principal power consumer, the operation\
    \ of the routing protocol must invlove\nfewer control messages. Also, it must\
    \ adapt to network turbulence due to SN failures.\nThe cluster-based architecture\
    \ exhibits the highest potential compared to related ar-\nchitectures [9,16,17,26].\
    \ The cluster heads (CHs) efﬁciently coordinate these activities\nby registering\
    \ and tolerating all dynamism resulting from SN-out-of-service faults,\nincreasing\
    \ the network size and SN density.\n•\nDue to the high vulnerability of SNs to\
    \ faults and failures, it is imperative to deploy\nsuitable FM techniques that\
    \ can detect, tolerate, or avoid possible root faults such\nas SN-out-of-service\
    \ and data outliers [25]. The adaptive clustering approach can\neffectively resolve\
    \ SN-out-of-service faults, while the threshold-based decision theory\nat the\
    \ local nodes and global levels can be suitable candidates for event data outlier\n\
    detection and correction in the PHY layer. Since power mismanagement is the root\n\
    cause of most faults and failures, the best fault-avoidance techniques optimize\
    \ the\nnodes’ power consumption rates.\n•\nFigure 10 also outlines the suitable\
    \ measures for power optimization in the WSN\nsublayer of Agri-IoT. In clustering\
    \ approaches, power consumption in the constrained\nWSN can be managed via message\
    \ complexity control, connectivity-related metrics,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters by exploiting the clustering architecture [46].\nIn addition to local\
    \ data processing (data aggregation, data redundancy, and error\nchecks) and local\
    \ network administration (FM, adaptability to network dynamics),\nsuitable MOO\
    \ and multihop routing frameworks can be derived using the clustering\narchitecture,\
    \ total communication cost, and optimal cluster quality metrics to serve as\n\
    a design optimization guide for the simulation and real-world implementations\
    \ of the\nWSN phase of Agri-IoT.\nTo achieve the expectations in Figure 10, there\
    \ is a need for an architecture-speciﬁc\nmulti-objective assessment of the WSN’s\
    \ design cycle; from this, the associated parameters\nand theoretical models can\
    \ be derived and then theoretically optimized and validated\nexperimentally. A\
    \ novel holistic MOO framework can help realize these expected goals in\nboth\
    \ simulation and real-world Agri-IoT implementations. Consequently, there exists\
    \ the\nneed to carry out a systematic survey and assessment on existing routing\
    \ architectures, FM\nschemes, and routing protocols, and how these evolved in\
    \ existing real-world realization\ntestbeds of Agri-IoT. Such an in-depth literature\

    In Agri-IoT, it is not simply a matter of applying IoT to a farm; contextual due\
    \ diligence\non architecture, communication standard, cost, actuator, performance\
    \ stability, control,\nand environmental impacts augment the routing protocol\
    \ requirements. This section\npresents a systematic synthesis of WSN-applicable\
    \ routing protocols under network ar-\nchitecture, the route discovery process,\
    \ and protocol operation as illustrated in Figure 11.\nTo help Agri-IoT designers\
    \ make well-informed decisions concerning architectural selection,\nwe classiﬁed\
    \ the canon protocols based on routing architecture, route-discovery process,\n\
    and operations in order to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and contextual\
    \ reasons why\nthey can be adopted for Agri-IoT applications. Generally, event\
    \ routing in every protocol\ncan either be source-initiated or destination-initiated,\
    \ and the optimal path selection from\nthe constructed routing architecture can\
    \ also be broadcast-based, probabilistic, cluster-\nbased, or parameter-determined\
    \ using location-related, weight-based, and content-based\nmetrics [13]. Also,\
    \ routing protocols must commonly resist link failures using mechanisms\nthat\
    \ ensure balanced network-wide power depletion rates, energy-efﬁcient multihop\
    \ rout-\ning, and effective implementation of the indispensable QoS metrics presented\
    \ in Figure 10.\nThe related routing protocols can be classiﬁed as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 11.\nIoT 2023, 4\n287\nfile:///C:/Users/emman/Downloads/704.svg\n\

    This class of protocols presented in Figures 11 and 12 can be sub-grouped into\
    \ ﬂat-\nbased centralized or direct communication and decentralized [47] (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂooding/peer-\nto-peer/graphical/mesh-like architectures), hierarchical/cluster-based/tree\
    \ architectures,\nand the location-based protocols [37].\n1/21/22, 11:11 AM\n\

    \ Sample network architectures: centralized-data-centric, cluster-based, and graph/ﬂooding-\n\
    based architectural frameworks of WSN sublayer.\nIoT 2023, 4\n288\nThe centralized\
    \ protocols route data to the BS via single-hop routing, while the ﬂooding\nand\
    \ graph-based protocols ﬂood data through multihop routing. The graph-based routing\n\
    protocols construct a reactive or proactive graphical routing architecture with\
    \ G(V, E)\nwhere a node and path represent the vertex and edges, respectively.\
    \ This method relies\non resource-intensive routing techniques from graph theory\
    \ used in classic IoT and ad\nhoc networks to transmit event data to the BS. In\
    \ contrast, the clustering/tree topology\ndepicted in Figure 12 groups the SNs\
    \ into either static or dynamic clusters, each with an\noptimally selected CH\
    \ to minimize the communication distances of the cluster’s member\nnodes (MN).\
    \ The CH is then tasked with aggregating the received readings from its MNs,\n\
    executing error and measurement redundancy checks, and communicating directly\
    \ (single-\nhop routing) or via a relay CH (RCH) using a multihop routing technique\
    \ to the sink\nnode or BS. However, the RCHs must be assigned fewer MNs to balance\
    \ the network’s\npower depletion rates, since aggregated packet forwarding inﬂicts\
    \ extra energy burden\non the RCHs [37]. Additionally, the CH can be equipped\
    \ to perform extra roles such as\nFM, coordination of the reclustering process,\
    \ network maintenance, relaying of aggregated\npackets in large-scale networks,\
    \ and management of network dynamism [12]. In general,\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocols differ in terms of CH selection methods and coincide in\nterms of\
    \ intra-cluster and inter-cluster multihop routing, local data processing by the\
    \ CHs,\nand CH role rotation [47], which ensure balanced network-wide power depletion,\
    \ prevent\nabrupt power exhaustion, and lead to exponential energy savings [37].\n\
    Although the ﬂat-based architectures, such as centralized and ﬂooding (see Figure\
    \ 12),\ncan be easily implemented in real-world small-scale Agri-IoT networks,\
    \ they suffer severe\npacket collisions, communication bottlenecking at the BS,\
    \ and high inaptness for scalable\nor turbulent large-scale WSNs where energy\
    \ efﬁciency is a priority. Again, an optimized\nclustering approach can provide\
    \ an ideal topology for addressing the proposed expectations\nin Figure 10, and\
    \ it can also offer extra beneﬁts such as minimized communication cost,\nstabilized\
    \ network topology, efﬁcient load management, improved network maintenance,\n\
    and improved network trafﬁc and channel access management [37,48]. The main challenge\n\
    of the clustering method is how to achieve the desired cluster quality (e.g.,\
    \ optimal cluster\ncount and cluster size) so that the computational, bandwidth,\
    \ memory, and routing table\ncapacities of the resource-constrained CHs are not\
    \ exceeded. Typical examples of clustering\nprotocols are the LEACH family of\
    \ protocols, which include RCEEFT, ESAA, DEEC, SEP,\nand PEGASIS in [12].\nIn\
    \ location-based routing architectures, routing decisions are made either reactively\n\
    (e.g., Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector—AODV) or proactively (e.g., RPL—Routing\n\
    over Low-Power and Lossy Networks protocol), using the SNs’ location information.\
    \ This\nnormally results in a decentralized, graphical architecture. Since the\
    \ SNs that form the\nWSN are spatially deployed in the ﬁeld without any IP-addressing\
    \ schemes, location\ninformation is needed in order to establish communication\
    \ between the nodes in a location-\nbased architecture. The location information\
    \ helps eliminate unwanted transmissions by\ncollecting data from a speciﬁc region\
    \ of interest. This architecture suffers from routing\ndelays, high infrastructural\
    \ cost, extreme difﬁculties in deployment and management,\nand high energy waste\
    \ due to SNs’ long idling durations. However, they are the most\ncommonly used\
    \ protocol in existing ZigBee-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1,10,14,17].\n\
    Since this approach yields non-energy-aware architectures, it is not suitable\
    \ for Agri-IoT\napplications [12].\nIt is evident from the above discussions that\
    \ Agri-IoT-based network architectures\nmust be deﬁned by the associated routing\
    \ protocol using the design requirements in Figure 9\nas well as the application-deﬁned\
    \ requirements [49] in order to enhance the performance\nexpectations in Figure\
    \ 10. In addition, the routing architecture must not compromise on\nthe quality,\
    \ precision, and accuracy of the event information. It must be in unison with\
    \ the\napplication-speciﬁc requirements to address possible deployments- and network-induced\n\
    challenges, such as network turbulence and SN mobility.\nIoT 2023, 4\n289\n5.2.\
    \ Route Discovery-Based Protocols\nAs shown in Figure 11, route discovery-based\
    \ protocols focus on when the route for\ndata transmission is built and can be\
    \ grouped into proactive, reactive, and hybrid protocols.\nIn proactive routing\
    \ protocols, the routes are pre-created before they are needed.\nThese protocols\
    \ are table-driven, since every node stores a large routing table containing a\n\
    list of all possible destinations, next-hop neighbors to those destinations, and\
    \ the associated\ncosts of all next-hop options. Proactive protocols such as the\
    \ RPL and the APTEEN family of\nprotocols [15] make local routing decisions using\
    \ the routing table’s content. For instance,\nthe RPL operates as a distant-vector\
    \ protocol for IPv6 low-power devices, utilizes the\nZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard\
    \ on established IP infrastructure, and also supports the\n6LoWPAN adaptation\
    \ layer. RPL creates a multihop tree routing hierarchy of SNs, such\nthat nodes\
    \ can send data through their respective parent nodes to the BS/sink node in a\n\
    ﬂooded manner (Figure 12). Similarly, the BS or sink node can send a unicast message\
    \ to a\nspeciﬁc SN in order to complete a bidirectional operational framework\
    \ of RPL. The optimal\ncommunication costs and routes are estimated by ranking\
    \ the associated objective function\n(OF) metrics, which can be single-objective\
    \ optimization, SOO metrics, or MOO metrics.\nThis routing over LLNs (RoLL) restricts\
    \ densely deployed and resource-limited SNs to\ncommunicate using peer-to-peer\
    \ or extended star network topologies [13]. Technically,\nRPL builds a directed\
    \ acyclic graph (DAG) with no outgoing edges from the root element\n(e.g., BS)\
    \ to eliminate loops. RPL is the primary underlying routing protocol in most failed\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed attempts. Although the proactive or RPL-based family of protocols\
    \ are\nrobust, reliable, scalable, and can relatively operate at minimized control\
    \ messages with the\nhelp of timers, they are not suitable for Agri-IoT networks\
    \ due to these technical challenges:\n•\nThe core of RPL/proactive protocols still\
    \ suffers from key challenges such as en-\nergy wastage, a lack of adaptability/scalability,\
    \ reliability, congestion, and security\nissues. Speciﬁcally, the energy expended\
    \ by RPL-inherited protocols to create routes\n(e.g., establish and maintain routing\
    \ tables) and transmit data can be too high for\nresource-constrained SNs in recent\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n•\nThe underlying technology of RPL (e.g., ZigBee, 6LoWPAN,\
    \ or IPv6) was designed\nfor energy-sufﬁcient devices with high processing and\
    \ memory capacities. Therefore,\nRPL is inapt for typical resourced-constrained\
    \ Agri-IoT networks (refer to Table 5).\n•\nThey require costly ﬁxed IP infrastructural\
    \ supports and utilize the centralized routing\narchitecture, which becomes practically\
    \ impossible to manage as the network scales.\nConversely, the source-initiated\
    \ reactive or on-demand routing protocols only create\nthe routes on-demand by\
    \ a source to send data to a receiver. Reactive protocols (e.g., Ad hoc\nOn-demand\
    \ Distance Vector, AODV Protocol [13]) have no speciﬁc procedures for creating\n\
    and updating routing tables with route information at regular intervals. For instance,\n\
    the AODV is a loop-free, self-starting, and reactive routing protocol meant for\
    \ LLNs\n(e.g., WSN-based IoT) that are characterized by node mobility, link failures,\
    \ and packet\nlosses. AODV mainly consists of the route discovery process (RREQ\
    \ and RREP messages)\nand route maintenance (RERR and HELLO messages). Although\
    \ reactive or AODV-based\nprotocols can adapt to network dynamics and eliminate\
    \ periodic updates, the associated\nﬂooding-based route–search process incurs\
    \ severe overheads resulting in high control\nmessage complexity, high route acquisition\
    \ latency, and high energy wastages due to longer\nSN idling periods. Consequently,\
    \ these protocols are unsuitable for power-constrained\nWSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n\
    The hybrid-based routing protocols merge the features of both reactive and proactive\n\
    routing processes. However, hybrid protocols such as APTEEN [13] also require\
    \ expensive\nﬁxed infrastructural support, which renders them unsuitable for Agri-IoT,\
    \ even if the\ncombined merits of reactive and proactive protocols are exploited.\n\
    A comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the parent WSN-based\n\
    routing protocols for Agri-IoT applications is illustrated in Table 5.\nIoT 2023,\

    \ and\nmaintenance)\n5.3. Operation-Based Routing Protocols\nFinally, routing\
    \ protocols can be classiﬁed based on the operation or communication\nmodel employed,\
    \ which may include:\n•\nNegotiation-Based Protocols: These protocols exchange\
    \ negotiation messages or use\nmeta-data negotiations between neighboring SNs\
    \ before the actual data transfers to\nreduce redundant transmissions in the network.\
    \ A typical example is the SPIN family\nof protocols [13].\n•\nMultipath-Based\
    \ Protocols: These use multiple routes simultaneously to accomplish\nhigher resilience\
    \ to route failure (i.e., fault tolerance) and load balancing.\n•\nQuery-Based\
    \ Routing Protocols: These are receiver-initiated protocols whereby a desti-\n\
    nation node broadcasts a query to initiate a data-sensing task from a node through\
    \ the\nnetwork. A node having the data being queried sends it in response to the\
    \ query.\n•\nCoherent and Non-Coherent Protocols: The coherent routing method\
    \ forwards data for\naggregation after a minimum local pre-processing. However,\
    \ in non-coherent routing,\nthe nodes locally process the raw data before routing\
    \ to the BS for further processing.\n•\nQoS-Based Routing Protocols: These protocols’\
    \ purpose is to satisfy a speciﬁc QoS metric\nor multiple QoS metrics such as\
    \ low latency, energy efﬁciency, or low packet loss.\nThese protocols ensure a\
    \ balance between energy consumption and data quality in\nevery event-reporting\
    \ task.\nIn addition to route architectural construction and data transmission,\
    \ efﬁcient MAC\nmust be embedded in the routing protocol to manage the wireless\
    \ medium access and the\nduty-cycle/sampling schedules of the deployed SNs in\
    \ Agri-IoT networks. As opposed\nto classic IoT, the MAC techniques in Agri-IoT\
    \ are architecture-deﬁned by the associated\nrouting protocol to meet the energy\
    \ efﬁciency requirements of the network via channel\naccess management (CAM) and\
    \ the moderation of the active–sleep duty cycles of the\ndeployed SNs to save\
    \ extra energy. The next subsection presents a concise overview of\nMAC techniques\
    \ and their roles in WSN-based Agri-IoT networks.\n5.4. MAC Techniques and Requirements\
    \ for Agri-IoT\nNext to node deployment, the routing protocol deﬁnes the network\
    \ architecture and\nselects a suitable MAC technique and a communication pattern\
    \ for the routing architec-\nture. Unlike classic IoT, requirements for Agri-IoT\
    \ applications include a low control\nIoT 2023, 4\n291\nmessage complexity and\
    \ low latency MAC technique that moderates sampling schedules,\naccess to a shared\
    \ medium, transceiver operation modes, (e.g., packet transmission and\nreception,\
    \ retransmission, collision, over-hearing, overhead handling, and idle listening)\n\
    active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs, and transceiver channels. Thus,\
    \ an MAC\nprotocol for WSN-based Agri-IoT applications must be architecture-speciﬁc\
    \ and adaptive\nto network dynamics such as data transmission errors, interferences/packet\
    \ collisions,\nand regular interfacing of the active–sleep duty-cycled schedules\
    \ of the SNs’ transceiver\nstates (e.g., transmitting state, receiving state,\
    \ idle state, and sleep state [52]) during packet\ntransmission and reception\
    \ in order to improve network throughput, energy efﬁciency,\nlatency, and other\
    \ QoS metrics.\nUnlike MAC protocols for classic IoT, an efﬁcient MAC technique\
    \ for Agri-IoT must\nensure exponential energy savings via channel assignment\
    \ management (CAM) and active–\nsleep duty-cycle coordination in both time and\
    \ channel perspectives. Based on these\ncommon dual tasks of Agri-IoT-based MAC\
    \ (thus, duty-cycle optimization—DCO and\nchannel access management—CAM), existing\
    \ IoT-based MAC techniques can be classiﬁed\nas illustrated in Figure 13 and the\

    \ surveyed core Agri-IoT-based routing protocols and evalu-\nated the parent protocols\
    \ (i.e., RPL, AODV, and LEACH/cluster-based families of protocols)\nfor classic\
    \ WSN-based IoT networks, of which LEACH-based methods are the best candi-\ndates\
    \ for the resource-limited WSN-based Agri-IoT. However, the RPL and AODV have\n\
    received more research considerations in terms of realizations in both simulations\
    \ and prac-\ntice [9,12,21]. Although the cluster-based architecture has unique\
    \ endowments for realizing\nthe proposed expectations in Figures 2 and 10, it\
    \ lacks an in-depth design synthesis in the\ncurrent state of the art that can\
    \ uncover its contextualized performance optimization modal-\nities for real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT applications. In addition, the deployment requirements with\ntrending\
    \ technologies such as BLE, LoRaWAN, SigFox, 5G, LoRa via Satellite, and NB-IoT\n\
    under both simulation and real-world operational conditions is imperative. Consequently,\n\
    the following sections present in-depth overviews on FM, the benchmarking of WSN-based\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed solutions, clustering methods in the existing state of the art,\
    \ and how\nthe possible deductions from these syntheses can evolve in a typical\
    \ case-study such as a\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT routing protocol for precision irrigation.\n\
    6. State of the Art on FM Techniques for Classic WSN Sublayer of IoT\nSince faults\
    \ and failures are inevitable in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks (refer\n\
    to Figure 10), it is imperative to reevaluate the faults, causes, types, strengths/weaknesses\n\
    of existing FM (i.e., fault detection—FD, fault tolerance—FT, and fault-avoidance—FA)\n\
    schemes, revisit their founding assumptions [71], and make appropriate recommendations\n\
    for Agri-IoT network designers. In this section, we establish the root source/cause(s)\
    \ of\nfaults in the WSN sublayer by assessing the behaviors of the different fault\
    \ types, examining\nthe extent to which the existing FM schemes address these\
    \ root faults, and exploring\nhow these schemes will evolve in realistic WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks based on their\ncore assumptions, control message overheads/complexities,\
    \ and energy-saving capacities.\nFrom this thorough assessment, this section proposes\
    \ practical fault-avoidance-based FM\ntechniques for the next generation of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT.\n6.1. Systematic Overview of Faults, Sources, and Taxonomy of Faults\
    \ in Agri-IoT\nAccording to the fault–error–failure cycle depicted in Figure 14,\
    \ a fault can be defined as\nany impairment that causes a system to produce erroneous\
    \ results or leads to the failure of the\nentire system or specific components\
    \ [72]. The prevalence of faults in WSN-based Agri-IoT\nis primarily due to the\
    \ SN component malfunction, lack of post-deployment maintenance,\nor resource\
    \ exhaustion [73], which can lead to either impaired event data quality (thus,\
    \ sensory\ndata error/outlier) or SN-out-of-service (thus, the shortened lifespan\
    \ of SNs) [25].\nDue to the high susceptibility of WSNs to faults, the supervisory\
    \ routing protocol is\nexpected to incorporate efﬁcient FM mechanisms that can\
    \ guarantee optimum event data\nquality and network availability. By implication,\
    \ FM algorithms for WSNs must not be\nstand-alone as currently seen in the state\
    \ of the art [73]; instead, they must be an integral\naspect of the routing protocol\
    \ that agrees with the core participants of the PHY layer, such as\nthe SN, wireless\
    \ communication medium, and the BS. As illustrated on the left of Figure 15,\n\
    the WSN sublayer is the most prevalent source of faults in the Agri-IoT ecosystem,\
    \ in which\nthe SNs are the central origin of faults that can propagate to the\
    \ upper layers [25,43,73].\nThis is because the BS is resource-sufﬁcient mainly,\
    \ and the link’s reliability also hinges\nupon the SNs’ availability, as indicated\
    \ in Figure 15. At the local SN’s level, each unit\ndepicted at the bottom of\
    \ Figure 3 is a potential source of fault/failure, but the degree of\nprevalence\
    \ is frequently accelerated whenever power consumption is mismanaged through\n\
    the disregard of any of the network design requirements and deployment conditions\n\
    presented in later sections.\nThe different taxonomies of faults in the state\
    \ of the art of the WSN sublayer [44,71,73–77],\nas illustrated on the left side\
    \ of Figure 16, can be compared as follows:\nIoT 2023, 4\n295\n•\nHard or permanent\
    \ fault refers to the inability of a node to stay active and communicate\ndue\
    \ to resource exhaustion or component malfunction, while in soft or static faults,\n\
    nodes continue to work and communicate with other nodes, but they sense, process,\n\
    or transmit erroneous data [44,74].\n•\nThe authors in [75,78] categorized faults\
    \ as permanent (refers to SN-out-of-service\nfaults), transient (caused by temporary\
    \ conditions), intermittent (shows sporadic\nmanifestations due to unstable behavior\
    \ of hardware and software), and potential\n(due to depletion of hardware resources\
    \ [78]).\n•\nData inconsistency faults can also result from faulty sensing, processing,\
    \ and communi-\ncation, which is frequently caused by power depletion below a\
    \ certain threshold, while\npower failure occurs when a node exhausts its battery\
    \ power completely [43,77,79].\n•\nThe authors in [73] classiﬁed faults into software\
    \ and hardware faults based on soft-\nware and hardware impairments, respectively.\n\
    •\nAccording to [71], faults can be either time-based, due to the depreciation\
    \ of hardware\ncomponents with time, or behavioral-based, due to SNs’ inability\
    \ to cope with harsh\nenvironmental and operating conditions.\n1/20/22, 8:48 PM\n\

    \ in the state of the art and proposed fault taxonomies for WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT.\n\
    From the above deﬁnitions and the fault taxonomies on the left side of Figure\
    \ 16, it can\nbe deduced that hard, permanent, and static faults are practically\
    \ manifested as SN-out-of-\nservice, while soft, dynamic, and data-inconsistency\
    \ faults can be observed as data outliers.\nBoth SN-out-of-service and data outliers\
    \ are consequences of unit malfunction or resource\nexhaustion and can be permanent\
    \ or intermittent in behavior. Both conditions can impair\nthe quality of event\
    \ data and the global actionable decisions of the network. Therefore,\nthe quality\
    \ of FM schemes can be evaluated based on their capacities to effectively detect,\n\
    tolerate, or avoid SN-out-of-service and data outlier faults. In summary, most\
    \ FM schemes\nin the state of the art focus on their effects, instead of the root\
    \ faults, which are the ﬂaws in\nexisting FM schemes [25]. Additionally, since\
    \ the SN is the sole network device responsible\nIoT 2023, 4\n297\nfor event sensing,\
    \ data computation, packet forwarding, and communication in the WSN\nsublayer\
    \ of Agri-IoT, it is the principal source of faults in Agri-IoT networks. A new\
    \ fault\nclassiﬁcation framework shown in Figure 16 can be deduced from the above\
    \ analysis.\nSecondly, it is discernible that SNs’ power mismanagement is the\
    \ most prevalent\norigin of faults [43,80,81], which then propagate to the backend\
    \ or application level (refer\nto the right side of Figure 15). For instance,\
    \ communication, sensing, and computational\naccuracies of a node can be impaired\
    \ when the battery energy falls below certain thresh-\nolds [43]. Also, network\
    \ faults can be traced to power exhaustion and node failures, which\ncreate holes\
    \ in the topology that divide the network into multiple disjointed segments [43].\n\
    On that account, faults can be avoided in WSN-based Agri-IoT if the energy-saving\
    \ strate-\ngies presented in Figures 9 and 10 are effectively implemented.\nAdditionally,\
    \ any FM scheme or fault-monitoring mechanism, be it proactive, reactive,\npassive,\
    \ or active, must incorporate the following underlying qualities: thresholds that\n\
    represent the probable fault conditions without false alarms, fault discovery,\
    \ minimized\nmessage/time complexities, and self-healing and self-reconﬁguration\
    \ to neutralize the\neffects of the faults [43].\nFM Framework and Architectures\
    \ in WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nAs illustrated in Figure 17, every FM scheme consists\
    \ of three main steps, which\ninclude fault detection (FD), fault diagnosis, and\
    \ fault recovery/tolerance (FT) [82,83],\nwhich always require input information.\
    \ These steps are implemented in a decision-making\nframework that involves four\
    \ major processes: data/information collection, FD model\nformulation, FD decision\
    \ and fault classiﬁcation, and tolerance of its effects using any of\nthe FT mechanisms\
    \ shown in Figure 17. Thus, the FD model detects the fault, the fault\ndiscovery\
    \ technique distinguishes that fault from false alarms, while the FT mechanism\n\
    helps to auto-heal and recover from the faults or failures [84]. Mainly, SN-out-of-service\n\
    faults are detected and tolerated using self-reconﬁguration techniques, whereas\
    \ data outlier\nfaults must strictly follow Figure 17.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n4.svg\n\

    Figure 17. FM framework in WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.\nIn addition, FM schemes\
    \ can be implemented using either a centralized or distributed\narchitecture [44,85,86].\
    \ In a centralized scheme, the FD/FT protocol is hosted and managed\non the BS,\
    \ whereas the distributed scheme hosts and manages this algorithm on the local\n\
    SNs [87,88] (see Figure 17). The centralized approach is simpler for small-scaled\
    \ networks\nbut suffers many technical challenges, such as common point failure\
    \ due to heavy message\ntrafﬁc at the BS and high SN energy waste. In contrast,\
    \ the distributed approach saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc on the BS\
    \ because it allows local decision and self-\nIoT 2023, 4\n298\nFD/FT with or\
    \ without neighboring. According to Figure 17, the distributed architecture\n\
    can be implemented in three major ways [43,89–91], which include self-detection,\
    \ neighbor\ncoordination, and the clustering approach. Since the basic design\
    \ requirement of a WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT is to maintain the healthy functionality\
    \ and longevity of the SNs and the\nBS, any post-deployment impairments that cannot\
    \ be self-ﬁxed must be tolerated to not\ninterfere with the core function of the\
    \ network. Therefore, any automated FT mechanism\nthat can be achieved through\
    \ the self-reconﬁguration and self-management for enhanced\nnetwork availability,\
    \ reliability, and dependability is encouraged in the WSN sublayer [92].\nAccording\
    \ to Figure 17, an efﬁcient WSN-based Agri-IoT, therefore, requires a calculated\n\
    mix of FT mechanisms based on the intended application.\n6.2. Systematic Survey\
    \ of Fault Management Schemes in WSN-Based IoT\nFM in Agri-IoT networks has not\
    \ received adequate conceptualized research con-\nsiderations. As a result, existing\
    \ Agri-IoT solutions inherit the FM propositions from\nthe traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT networks, which have proven to be unsuitable [14]. This\nsubsection presents\
    \ a concise overview of these FM schemes, including their strengths,\nweaknesses,\
    \ and underlying theories/concepts. It then proposes a more suitable remedy for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. In canon centralized FM schemes (see references\
    \ in [93–97]),\nthe underlying FM algorithm is hosted and managed on the BS, while\
    \ the local SNs host\nand manage the FM algorithm in distributed architectures\
    \ [87,88]. Although the centralized\napproach is simpler for small-scale networks,\
    \ it suffers many technical challenges, such\nas common point failure due to heavy\
    \ message trafﬁc at the BS, management difﬁculties,\nand high energy wastages\
    \ on distant routing. This clearly explains why most outdoor\nAgri-IoT testbed\
    \ experiments in [1,10,11,14,18,19] experienced severe FM complications to\nthe\
    \ extent that the networks became infeasible to operate or manage at higher scalability\n\
    levels. However, the distributed approach (see references in [74,76,77,91,98–103])\
    \ saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc and workload on the BS because it allows\
    \ local decisions\nas well as local-FD/FT with or without neighboring nodes. The\
    \ distributed FD/FT scheme\ncan also be self-executed, neighbor-coordinated, or\
    \ clustering-aided [89–91]. Although the\nclustering-based FM architecture has\
    \ promising potential to improve energy conservation,\nnetwork adaptability, and\
    \ ease of implementation, it has not been extensively researched\nand exploited.\n\
    Again, distributed FD schemes are mainly established on the assumption that the\n\
    failure of SNs is spatially uncorrelated, while event information is spatially\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, the FD’s decision framework is frequently modeled using\
    \ sensory data or statis-\ntical properties of the spatial or temporally correlated\
    \ SNs [79,104–106] from the immediate\nneighborhood of a node [74,103] or data\
    \ from farther SNs [107]. To date, the applicabil-\nity of these solutions to\
    \ the Agri-IoT context has attracted several technical challenges.\nConsequently,\
    \ the strengths and weaknesses of the main results of the benchmarking FM\nschemes,\
    \ their underlying assumptions, and how they addressed the critical fault-afﬁnity\n\
    factors such as energy conservation, FT/FA, control message complexity, and processor\n\

    \ and Their Shortcomings\nThe conceptual models/theories of the canon FD decision\
    \ frameworks and the associ-\nated shortcomings can be expressed as follows:\n\
    •\nStatistical approaches such as Neyman–Pearson formulation [116], Bayesian statis-\n\
    tics [77,103], and normal distribution test types (e.g., Thompson Tau statistical\
    \ test [105])\nare high-resource-demanding techniques that may apply to classic\
    \ IoT. Still, they are\nunsuitable for power-constrained Agri-IoT devices or SNs.\
    \ In addition to being stand-\nalone and without application speciﬁcity, these\
    \ methods operate at high computational\nand control message complexities. Their\
    \ operational efﬁciencies increase with increas-\ning data dimensionality and\
    \ also require a priori knowledge of data distribution,\nwhich is not possible\
    \ in many real-life applications of Agri-IoT networks. Additionally,\nthey rely\
    \ on predeﬁned thresholds to make local and global FD decisions. Therefore,\n\
    regardless of the extensive research considerations of these methods, they are\
    \ generally\nnot suitable for low-power IoT applications, of which Agri-IoT is\
    \ no exception.\n•\nGraph-based FM techniques lack precise criteria for outlier\
    \ detections [83,109], suffer\nhigher computational complexities, and also make\
    \ unrealistic assumptions about the\ndata distribution. In addition, these approaches\
    \ (e.g., De Bruijn graph theory [109]\nand depth-based techniques) are unsuitable\
    \ for multidimensional and huge datasets.\n•\nMachine learning decision concepts\
    \ such as the k-out-of-n and majority decision\nrule concepts [93], naive Bayes,\
    \ iterative algorithms [107], and neural network-based\ntechniques, among others,\
    \ are susceptible to high dimensional datasets, suffer high\ncomputational cost,\
    \ and rely on sensitive model parameters.\nIn addition to the stipulated shortcomings,\
    \ these benchmarking FM methods usually\nignore the sensory data correlation (i.e.,\
    \ attribute correlation, spatial correlation, and tem-\nporal correlation) properties\
    \ of SNs, require high communication overhead with high FD\ndelays [83], and normally\
    \ operate in an ofﬂine manner, which is inconsistent with the\nmodus operandi\
    \ of typical Agri-IoT. Hence, they are unsuitable for the recent low-power\nAgri-IoT\
    \ applications.\n6.4. Open Issues on Existing FM Solutions for Classic WSN-Based\
    \ IoT Networks and\nRecommended Design Guidelines for Achieving Efﬁcient FM in\
    \ WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nA fault in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks can be\
    \ manifested as a data outlier\nand SN-out-of-service or node failure, both of\
    \ which must be detected and resolved locally\nor globally using the spatially\
    \ correlated event information and efﬁcient threshold-based\ndecision frameworks.\
    \ Although there has been extensive research concerning FM schemes\nfor the WSN\
    \ sublayer, several technical challenges that require urgent contextual research\n\
    considerations exist. They include the following:\n1.\nMost faults in the PHY\
    \ layer of Agri-IoT originate from the SNs’ power exhaustion,\nwhich implies that\
    \ the best fault-avoidance techniques are those that optimize power\nconsumption.\
    \ However, most FM schemes waste more energy and make the net-\nwork prone to\
    \ more faults/failures via high control messages and computational\ncomplexities.\n\
    2.\nMost FM schemes exist as stand-alone frameworks without architectural consider-\n\
    ations and are founded on unrealistic assumptions, which make them difﬁcult to\n\
    incorporate into existing routing protocols.\n3.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture\
    \ is endowed with many untapped local/global FM\npotentials and fault-avoidance\
    \ capacities for the next-generation Agri-IoT. However, these\npromising potentials\
    \ have received the least contextualized research considerations.\nExisting FM\
    \ solutions are meant for resource-sufﬁcient and expensive classic WSN-\nbased\
    \ IoT, not resource-constrained, context-speciﬁc use cases like Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    Regarding these technical challenges, this tutorial presents the following design\
    \ guidelines\nfor building efﬁcient and realistic FM schemes for WSN-based Agri-IoT:\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n302\n1.\nFM schemes must rely on realistic and contextual assumptions\
    \ in order to detect and\nauto-tolerate sensory data outliers and SN-out-of-service\
    \ faults in real-time routing\nprotocols with minimal message, computational,\
    \ and memory complexities. Such FM\nschemes will be suitable for all power-constrained\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n2.\nFuture works on FM schemes must be embedded\
    \ into speciﬁc routing protocols so\nthat their adaptability to topological dynamism\
    \ and scalability in terms of network\nsizes and node densities can be assessed\
    \ in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, fault\ndetection and fault-tolerance schemes\
    \ based on simple threshold-based theories are\nthe best candidates for this context,\
    \ since the threshold boundaries of agronomical\nmetrics can be accurately computed\
    \ from the historical data of the location.\n3.\nFM schemes must incorporate redundancy\
    \ check mechanisms by exploiting spatial\nand temporal correlations among sensory\
    \ data.\n4.\nFM schemes should maintain a good balance between local and global\

    \ well documented that WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most reliable remedy for mitigat-\n\
    ing the negative impacts climate change has had on agricultural production, for\
    \ which many\narchitectural designs and testbed prototypes have been proposed\
    \ [12,36]. In addition, since\nthe autonomous, resource-constrained SNs in Agri-IoT\
    \ are expected to operate without\npost-deployment maintenance checks, the issues\
    \ of FM, power optimization, and self-\norganization during SN design and network\
    \ deployment cannot be ignored in existing\ntestbed solutions [12,117]. Essentially,\
    \ the results from most research projects on Agri-IoT\nrelied on simulation experiments\
    \ [1,10,14], which have retained the gap between the phi-\nlosophy of this technology\
    \ and the comprehension of its real-world behavior for a more ac-\ncurate performance\
    \ assessment. This section presents a systematic performance assessment\nof the\
    \ few real-world WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions currently based on the classic\n\
    WSN-based IoT principles. To understand how the benchmarking realization testbeds\
    \ of\nAgri-IoT in [1,10,11,14,18,19] fared in real-world operational conditions,\
    \ the results from\ntheir respective performances are systematically evaluated\
    \ and summarized in Table 8. It\nwas discovered that the current benchmarking\
    \ testbed solutions in [1,10,11,14,18,19] are\ncapital-intensive because they\
    \ are reliant on ﬁxed/location-restricted backbone infrastruc-\ntures (see the\
    \ middle of Figure 3), too complicated to deploy and manage by even expert\nusers,\
    \ based on unrealistic indoor conditions which do not commensurate real-world\
    \ envi-\nronmental conditions, and based on the high- power-demanding centralized\
    \ or ﬂooding\narchitectures which further complicate network manageability when\
    \ up-scaled. A concise\nand systematic survey of these benchmarking real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT networks and their ﬂaws\nin the state of the art is summarized in Table\
    \ 8.\nAdditionally, it can be established from the comparative assessment of the\
    \ benchmark-\ning Agri-IoT testbeds in Table 8 [10,11,18,19] that the embedded\
    \ communication technology,\nevent routing architecture, and the SNs’ power management\
    \ are the core factors that made\nthem capital-intensive and complicated to both\
    \ experts and low-income farmers. Addi-\ntionally, self-healing, reconﬁgurability,\
    \ and adaptability mechanisms to faults were not\ndeployed [1,14,17]; hence, faulty\
    \ and turbulent conditions could not be tolerated. Further-\nmore, since the battery-powered\
    \ SNs rely on expensive Wi-Fi and cellular communication\ntechnologies that are\
    \ not freely accessible at all locations, the SNs exhausted their battery\nsupply\
    \ a few days after deployment. Similarly, those that relied on ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.\
    \ 4\ncommunication technologies with power-intensive 6LoWPAN or IPv6 protocols\
    \ restricted\nthe resulting network to drive on the problematic centralized or\
    \ ﬂooding architectures\nwithout any efﬁcient FM techniques. As a result, these\
    \ solutions used costly ﬁxed IP\ninfrastructural supports and the centralized\
    \ routing architecture, making them practically\nimpossible to manage as the networks\
    \ scaled. This is why the SNs unstably exhausted their\nbattery power and abruptly\
    \ abridged network lifespans [1,10,11,14,18,19].\nIoT 2023, 4\n303\nTable 8. Comparative\

    Therefore, the freely available low-power wireless technologies (e.g., LoRa, BLE,\
    \ 5G,\nZ-wave, NB-IoT, and SigFox) that are founded on a suitable routing topology\
    \ are the best\ncandidates for making this ubiquitous application [1,16] cheap\
    \ [1,20] and simple for all\nusers. Thus, the cluster-based topology is more pivotal\
    \ to addressing the above challenges\nof Agri-IoT [10,17] than the traditional\
    \ cellular and WiFi technologies that are inaccessible\nin many farms, depending\
    \ on their locations [10,20]. However, besides distance-power\nconstraints, architectural\
    \ support, and network manageability challenges, these freely\naccessible wireless\
    \ communication technologies have speciﬁc limitations, which include:\n1.\nZigBee\
    \ technology achieves the desired power savings only when deployed in star or\n\
    centralized topology [14], and it operates at its low-power distance range (10–100\
    \ m)\nin line-of-sight mode depending on the environmental characteristics.\n\
    2.\nLoRa is limited to low-density and ﬁxed network sizes (non-scalable), a low\
    \ data rate,\nand a low message capacity [14]. It may require registration and\
    \ expensive antennae,\ndepending on its operation location.\n3.\nSigFox supports\
    \ a very low data rate and requires registration. LoRa and SigFox\npossess complex\
    \ implementations because they both require speciﬁc modules to\nfunction and gateways.\n\
    4.\nWiFi, GPRS, cellular technologies, and NB-IoT are high power consumption standards\n\
    and location-/architecture-restricted.\n5.\nBLE has a short communication range\
    \ but supports clustering architecture, which is the\nmost optimal architecture\
    \ for ensuring the best operational efﬁciency of WSN-based\nAgri-IoT deployments,\
    \ since this architecture allows cluster isolation and management.\nTherefore,\
    \ a research opportunity exists for a ﬂexible, ubiquitous, realistic, energy-\n\
    efﬁcient, self-healing, simple, low-cost, cluster-based, and wireless outdoor-based\
    \ testbed\nthat consists of infrastructure-less, task-scalable, and wirelessly\
    \ conﬁgurable experimental\nSNs and a BS. It should also be deployed, re-deployed,\
    \ monitored, controlled, and managed\nby non-experts to operate stably throughout\
    \ the entire crop-growing season.\n8. Case Study: Cluster-Based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\
    \ for Precision Irrigation\nAs earlier established in Figure 2, the design and\
    \ implementation of Agri-IoT networks\nare driven by unique critical factors,\
    \ which are mainly determined by the associated\nrouting architecture, communication\
    \ technology, actuation management mechanisms,\nand environmental impacts. In\
    \ the operation phase, these factors constitute the speciﬁc\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10, which the supervisory routing protocol must address in order\nto optimize\
    \ performance efﬁciency and stability. As systematically established above,\n\
    the LEACH-inherited cluster-based architecture has the most promising potential\
    \ to address\nIoT 2023, 4\n304\nthese technical challenges. It helps to attain\
    \ high power optimization via communication\ndistance and packet minimization,\
    \ efficient network administration/adaptability, high event\ndata quality through\
    \ auto-FM, and local data quality management, as indicated in Figure 10.\nSo,\
    \ this section presents a systematic analysis of how the merits of this architecture\
    \ evolve\nin CA-IoT for precision irrigation use cases. Using the framework in\
    \ Figure 12, the cluster-\nbased architecture was pre-examined to uncover how\
    \ the fundamental Agri-IoT design\nrequirements and goals presented in the reference\
    \ frameworks in Figures 2, 9 and 10 can\nunfold into realistic multi-parametric\
    \ optimization metrics.\nThe conceptual architectural framework of the proposed\
    \ network, as illustrated in\nFigure 18, can be implemented using Arduino-based\
    \ or Raspberry Pi(RPi)-based micro-\ncontrollers, BLE and LoRa for intra-cluster,\
    \ inter-cluster, and BS–cloud communications,\nrespectively, and DHT22/STEMMA\
    \ soil moisture sensors for measuring the respective\nambient and soil microclimatic\
    \ parameters. Also, a unit cluster from Figure 18 detailing\nthe key network components\
    \ of MNs, CH, BS, and the ﬁeld-deployed precision irrigation\nsystem is shown\
    \ in Figure 19. It is assumed that the core units constituting the MNs, CH,\n\
    and BS, as illustrated in Figure 19, are optimally selected and designed after\
    \ Figure 2. Using\nFigures 18 and 19 as the reference architectural frameworks\
    \ for achieving our contextualized\nobjectives, this section presents an in-depth\
    \ systematic assessment and characterization\nof the scores of canon cluster-based\
    \ routing protocols of conventional WSN-based IoT\napplications so that the desired\
    \ MOO metrics can be appropriately deduced and adapted\nfor the design of the\

    \ 20a, the cluster features deﬁne the underlying connectivity\nissues, such as\
    \ cluster quality indices (thus, cluster count, cluster size) and intra-cluster\n\
    and inter-cluster communication types (thus, single-hop or multihop or both) [23,24].\n\
    From the network design viewpoint, the cluster quality depends on the optimality\
    \ of the\nCH count and cluster sizes, which in turn rely on the core design parameters,\
    \ such as the\nspatial density and uniformity of the deployed nodes, the speciﬁcation\
    \ of the wireless\ncommunication standard, the routing architecture, and the size\
    \ of the network [47]. Since\nthe deployment of SNs in a typical Agri-IoT can\
    \ be controlled, the stipulated cluster quality\nproperties can be optimized to\
    \ resolve connectivity issues in Figure 20b. In a randomly\ndeployed ﬁeld, these\
    \ cluster quality parameters can be optimized using a pairing-based SN\nduty-scheduling\
    \ mechanisms [9,12].\nSecondly, the CH features can be static, mobile, or role-rotated\
    \ in both homogeneous\nor heterogeneous networks [9,12] based on the SNs’ resource\
    \ hierarchy. Additionally,\nthe CHs can be assigned different tasks, such as data\
    \ aggregation, FM, coordinating\nnetwork reconﬁguration or duty cycling, and network\
    \ maintenance, depending on their\nresource capacities and network requirements.\
    \ This case study is based on static SNs and\nthe distributed network construction\
    \ approach (see references in [9,12,33,126–132]), where\nthe SNs locally manage\
    \ the entire clustering process, and a CH is elected without the entire\nnetwork’s\
    \ information.\nAs shown in Figure 20a, the clustering process can be characterized\
    \ by the clustering\nmethod/network type (thus, centralized or distributed), the\
    \ CH selection method, recluster-\ning or network adaptability to topological\
    \ or scalable conditions, and the complexities (thus,\ncontrol message and computational\
    \ complexities) of the entire network operation cycle.\nUnlike the static approach\
    \ with ﬁxed CH, the adaptive clustering approach selects CH\nbased on the current\
    \ network conditions and rotates this role. However, both approaches\ncan incorporate\
    \ self-reclustering techniques to self-heal SN-out-of-service faults. Data\noutlier\
    \ faults can be best detected and corrected using threshold-based decision theory\
    \ or\nspatial correlation methods with the least complexities. Due to the large-scale\
    \ and high\ndeployment densities of WSN-based Agri-IoT, the distributed clustering\
    \ process is more\nsuitable for enhancing local FM, scalability, network management,\
    \ and power optimization\nthan the centralized approaches [37,47].\nGenerally,\
    \ the CA-IoT network can be optimized by formulating the deduced optimal\ndecision\
    \ metrics in Figure 20a into a MOO framework and multihop routing model in\norder\
    \ to provide the guidelines for the design of the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. From\
    \ the\ncomparative evaluations of Figures 10 and 20a, a taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ for designing\nan efﬁcient WSN-based CA-IoT network is proposed in Figure 20b.\
    \ To enhance the clarity\nof the state of the art on cluster-based protocols and\
    \ justify the need for the proposed MOO\nmetrics, a comparative summary based\
    \ on the characterization parameters is presented in\nTable 9.\n8.2. CH Election\
    \ Techniques\nA CH selection process is very critical to the resulting network’s\
    \ performance efﬁciency.\nIn addition to centralized networks and the computationally\
    \ expensive fuzzy-based clus-\ntering approaches [133,134], the efﬁciencies of\
    \ all LEACH-inherited protocols are mainly\ndependent on their CH selection techniques\
    \ [47,49]. Therefore, the correct estimation of\nthe cluster quality metrics (i.e.,\
    \ CHs count and cluster size) is pivotal in attaining the\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10. With the aid of nodes’ residual energy and location metrics, the op-\ntimal\
    \ CH count and cluster size can be preset before network deployment. Currently,\n\
    these metrics are randomly selected using a probabilistic approach in LEACH-inherited\n\
    protocol [9,21] or derived using a deterministic or an attribute-based method\
    \ [47,135].\nHowever, the probabilistic clustering, such as the LEACH-inherited\
    \ protocols, is expected\nto perform better in terms of network lifespan, minimal\
    \ clustering overhead, improved\nconnectivity, network/coverage stability, low\
    \ latency, collision-free routing, load balanc-\ning, high network stability span,\
    \ and algorithmic simplicity if the optimal CH count was\nIoT 2023, 4\n308\npredeﬁned\
    \ correctly [136]. However, the CH count is randomly predeﬁned in these proto-\n\
    cols [9,21], which undermines the CH’s stability and the resulting architecture’s\
    \ optimality.\nThis challenge can be addressed via common CH selection metrics\
    \ including Euclidean\ndistance, intra-cluster/inter-cluster communication costs,\
    \ energy-harvesting capacities,\nand probabilistic factors. To date, the related\
    \ attempts in [49,126,137–139] only relied on\nthe SNs’ residual energy and location\
    \ information to re-elect CHs after the initial CH count\nis deﬁned, which cannot\
    \ be ideal for WSN-based Agri-IoT.\nFor instance, an active SN in a particular\
    \ round decides whether or not to become\na CH by choosing a random number (rn)\
    \ ranging between 0 and 1 and comparing the\nnumber with a speciﬁed threshold\
    \ Th. A node, therefore, becomes a CH for that round if\nrn < Th, where Th is\
    \ expressed as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd×(( f irst−round)mod 1\npd\n,\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(1)\nwhere pd is the desired percentage of CHs or CH count per round,\
    \ and G is the number of\nSNs that have not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds.\n\
    The authors in [119] proposed a three-layered LEACH (TL-LEACH) that operates in\n\
    three functional phases—CH election, MN recruitment, and data transfer—to enhance\
    \ the\nenergy efﬁciency of LEACH. Their ﬁrst-level CH election approach modiﬁed\
    \ Equation (1)\ninto an enhanced threshold T(i), which is expressed as:\nT(i)\
    \ =\n(\n(r + 1) × mod( 1\np × p),\nif i ∈ G\n0,\notherwise\n(2)\nwhere p is the\
    \ CH count, r is the current round number, and G is the number of SNs that\nhave\
    \ not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds. The second-level CHs are selected\
    \ from\nthe ﬁrst-level CHs based on the shortest distance to the BS to function\
    \ as aggregated packet\nforwarders or relay CHs (RCHs).\nThe authors in [120]\
    \ introduced energy (E(i)) and distance (D(i)) attributes into Equa-\ntion (1)\
    \ to improve the load-balancing merit of LEACH. The resulting Th is expressed\
    \ as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd[r×mod 1\npd ] × [E(i) + (1 − D(i))],\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(3)\nMultihop routing via relay CHs (RCHs) was recommended for distant\
    \ CHs in the\nfuture scope of [120].\nIn the LEACH presented with a distance-based\
    \ threshold (LEACH-DT) algorithm\nin [121], the probability of becoming a CH depends\
    \ on the relative distance between a\nnode and the BS. This algorithm differs\
    \ from the LEACH algorithm because the desired\npercentage of CHs (pi) is predeﬁned\
    \ using Equation (5), while the threshold T(I, r) is\nexpressed as:\nT(i, r) =\n\
    (\npi\n1−pi×[r×mod 1\npi ],\nif Gi(r) = 0\n0,\nif Gi(r) = 1\n(4)\nNote that the\
    \ terms retain their usual deﬁnitions, namely:\np(i) = k\nξi\n∑N\nj=1 ξj\n, 0\
    \ ≤ pi ≤ 1,\n(5)\nwhere\nξi = 1/ECH × di − Enon−CH,\n(6)\nThe variable di depicts\
    \ the distance between node i and the BS, and ECH and Enon−CH\nare the average\
    \ residual energies in CHs and non-CHs, respectively. The authors further\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n309\nestablished the need for a multihop routing approach in simulations\
    \ and real-world WSNs\nto validate the countless theoretical propositions and\
    \ beneﬁts.\nIn the decentralized energy-efﬁcient hierarchical cluster-based routing\
    \ algorithm\n(DHCR) [123], SNs compete to become CHs. First, the BS broadcasts\
    \ a trigger message at a\nspeciﬁc range. The receiving nodes then compete to become\
    \ a CH by disseminating a new\nmessage containing their residual energies and\
    \ distances from the BS. Using this informa-\ntion, a neighboring node i within\
    \ the target range receives the message and calculates its\nCHSn f uni as:\nCHSn\
    \ f uni = a × Erei\nEmax\n+ b ×\n1\nDis − To − BSi\n,\n(7)\nwhere Erei and Emax\
    \ are the residual and initial energy levels of node i, respectively;\nDis − To\
    \ − BSi is the distance between node i and the BS, and a and b are real random\n\
    values between 0 and 1 such that a + b = 1. The values of Dis − To − BSi of node\
    \ i\nand its neighbors are compared, and the node with the highest Dis − To −\
    \ BSi value is\nselected as the CH. A ﬁrst-level CH broadcasts its residual energy,\
    \ neighboring node count,\nand distance from the BS via a speciﬁc route. The next-level\
    \ CHs receive the information\nand similarly repeat the procedure to ensure that\
    \ every node determines a redistributor\nCH to the BS at the same time. A redistributor\
    \ CH has more energy and fewer neighbors\n(neighboring degrees).\nHowever, the\
    \ Hamilton energy-efﬁcient routing protocol (HEER) [124] creates an\nentire cluster\
    \ of nodes, aggregates data, and transmits them to the BS via a Hamiltonian\n\
    path that has been created by the entire cluster of nodes and controls the cluster\
    \ size by\nselecting one node as the CH using the probability function p, which\
    \ can be expressed as:\np = Lmessage\nFmax\n(8)\nwhere Lmessage is the size of\
    \ every node, and Fmax is the maximum size of a frame. The\nHEER protocol creates\
    \ the clusters only once in the ﬁrst round based on LEACH, and it\nrole-rotates\
    \ the CHs per the energy on the Hamiltonian path after a determined period.\n\
    Similarly, the two-phased EAMR protocol [125] randomly preselects the CH. A CH\n\
    also selects its closest CH as its redistributor CH. The clusters are static over\
    \ the entire\nnetwork lifetime, and the CH role rotates randomly within the clusters\
    \ according to a cluster\nreplacement threshold. The new CH inherits the redistributor\
    \ role if the old CH had one.\nOverall, since the node location, residual energy,\
    \ and sleep schedule are indispensable in the\nCH selection process, the CH selection\
    \ methods proposed by the authors in [9,12,36,120,140]\nare recommended WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n8.3. Challenges of Existing MOO Frameworks and Recommended\
    \ Future Works\nAs Figures 9 and 10 illustrate, the performance efﬁciency of an\
    \ infrastructure-less\nWSN-based Agri-IoT mainly depends on the embedded MOO remedies\
    \ in the associated\nsupervisory routing protocol [12]. Several MOO frameworks\
    \ have been researched since\nAgri-IoT networks are subjected to multiple design\
    \ and operational constraints. A MOO\nframework is expected to formulate multiple\
    \ objective functions from a set of MOO metrics\nto simultaneously optimize these\
    \ multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy savings,\nhighest connectivity,\
    \ best latency, highest reliability, and balanced SN power depletion\nrates across\
    \ the network. Although the MOO methods are the best candidates for Agri-IoT,\n\
    the existing MOO solutions used in Agri-IoT are adopted from traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT\nwithout any contextual evaluation [12,16,26]. Consequently, they have not\
    \ fulﬁlled their\nintended purposes due to several technical challenges, including\
    \ the following:\n1.\nThey are limited to non-cluster-based network architectures,\
    \ which implies that the promis-\ning potentials of the clustering architecture\
    \ are not adequately exploited [9,12,50,51].\n2.\nThey are frequently implemented\
    \ in the operational phase of the network, which\nmakes it challenging to ﬁnd\
    \ global optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nIoT 2023, 4\n310\n\
    conﬂicting objective functions. The performance optimality of the Agri-IoT network\n\
    starts from the SN design.\n3.\nThey rely on high-resource-demanding algorithms,\
    \ such as mathematical programming-\nbased scalarization methods, multi-objective\
    \ genetic algorithms (MOGAs), heuristics/\nmetaheuristics-based optimization algorithms,\
    \ and other advanced optimization\ntechniques [23,26,48], making them unsuitable\
    \ for the battery-powered SNs in Agri-IoT.\n4.\nThere are no contextual MOO guidelines\
    \ based on Figure 20 to govern the PHY-layer\ndesign of Agri-IoT to achieve global\
    \ optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nconﬂicting objectives. Consequently,\
    \ there are conﬂicting scenarios in existing MOO\nsolutions [50].\nTherefore,\
    \ there is an urgent demand for a realistic low-power MOO framework for\nCA-IoT\
    \ networks that is founded on the core WSN design metrics and MOO taxonomy\nmetrics\
    \ in Figure 10 and the top of Figure 20, respectively. The following section assesses\n\
    how evaluations and deductions evolve in a typical event sampling and routing\
    \ protocol\nin a CA-IoT network for precision irrigation system management.\n\
    9. Design of WSN-Speciﬁc CA-IoT Routing Protocol\nThis section proposes a CA-IoT-based\
    \ supervisory routing protocol that supports\nstatic SNs, rotatable/ﬁxed CH roles,\
    \ and enhanced SN resource management under the\ndeterministic deployment approach.\
    \ This can improve energy savings, connectivity, dis-\ntance moderation, and multihop\
    \ inter-cluster communication in the resulting network.\nThe operational cycle\
    \ and the embedded activities of our WSN-based CA-IoT protocol for\nprecision\
    \ irrigation application, as illustrated in Figure 21, include the following:\n\
    1.\nNetwork Construction or Setup Phase: This phase involves network modeling,\
    \ CH election,\nand cluster formation, which is explained in Figure 21. The active–sleep\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduling ensures the SNs only switch to active mode during their\
    \ scheduled sampling\ndurations. In randomly deployed WSNs, redundant event reporting\
    \ can be avoided\nusing a correlated pairing-based active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling\
    \ approach in [12].\nThe optimal CH count and cluster size must be predeﬁned from\
    \ the resource capacities\nof the SNs. After the initial CH election, the MNs\
    \ are recruited and assigned their\nrespective sampling and intra-cluster communication\
    \ timeslots.\n2.\nSampling, Data Management, and Transmission Phase: The tasks\
    \ executed in this phase\ninclude event sampling, intra-cluster and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmissions, data outlier\nFM, and event data redundancy management.\
    \ Since microclimatic soil parameters do\nnot change swiftly [1,14], sampling\
    \ can only be scheduled during the day at 3-hourly\ntime intervals. In addition\
    \ to power optimization, the clustering approach provides\nsuperb potential for\
    \ both local and global FM using threshold-based FM theory and\nspatial correlation\
    \ techniques. Based on the architecture in Figure 19 and the resource\nlimitations\
    \ of the SNs, it is recommended that the communication beyond the BS or\ngateway\
    \ can utilize LoRa or Wi-Fi AirBox, whereas the intra-cluster and inter-cluster\n\
    communications must be the freely available low-power BLE technology, since it\
    \ is\nthe most suitable for the clustering architecture.\n3.\nNetwork Maintenance\
    \ and Reclustering Phase: This phase resolves all unforeseen topolog-\nical dynamics\
    \ caused by the SNs’ failures, network scalability, node mobility, and un-\nexpected\
    \ operational ﬂaws, without interfering with the normal network functionality\n\
    via adaptive reclustering, self-healing, and multihop routing techniques [12,23,24].\n\
    Here, a parent CH coordinates the election of child CHs (CCHs). While all non-CCHs\n\
    switch to sleep mode, the CCHs recruit new MNs using location and residual energy\n\
    parameters, assign them their respective sampling timeslots, and repeat Phase\
    \ 2 after-\nward, as shown in Figure 21. SN-out-of-service faults are auto-detected\
    \ and tolerated\nin this phase.\nIoT 2023, 4\n311\nCA-IoT  \nOperational\nCycle\n\

    \ FM/data redundancy scheme, network construc-\ntion/maintenance, and cluster\
    \ quality measures that can ensure unprecedented energy\nsavings and event data\
    \ quality. This clustering approach can further minimize energy\nwastage via a\
    \ suitable MAC method, a low-power wireless communication standard, data\naggregation\
    \ with data redundancy checks, and CH role rotation, among other factors.\nAlthough\
    \ the various sections of the deduced MOO metrics have been implemented in our\n\
    CA-IoT operational cycle, the most desired performance can be optimally attained\
    \ when\nthe MOO metrics are modeled into their respective objective functions,\
    \ and their optimal\nvalues are determined and implemented in both simulation\
    \ and testbed experiments in\nfuture works. Also, a realistic multihop routing\
    \ framework can also be inculcated into this\nprotocol for large-scale applications.\n\
    10. Open Issues and Future Works: Cluster-Based WSN-Speciﬁc Agri-IoT Networks\n\
    This tutorial has ﬁrmly established that the WSN-based Agri-IoT is an indispens-\n\
    able component of smart or precision farming and greenhouses, despite its resource-\
    \ and\ndeployment-induced challenges [12,26,141]. Unlike the conventional IoT,\
    \ Agri-IoT is com-\npelled to drive on batteries and affordable task-scalable\
    \ SNs. However, it must meet the\nexpectations in Figure 2 to guarantee a stable\
    \ performance. The cluster-based routing\ntechnique has emerged with promising\
    \ potential to mitigate these challenges. However,\nresults from existing testbed\
    \ solutions in this study show otherwise due to the absence of a\ncontextualized\
    \ in-depth overview of Agri-IoT as well as the following open issues which\nhave\
    \ not received extensive contextual research considerations in Agri-IoT applications:\n\
    1.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture for WSN-based Agri-IoT has not received\
    \ holistic\nand practical research considerations as far as FM, power optimization,\
    \ and network\nadaptability are concerned. Therefore, there is a demand for multi-parametric\
    \ optimiza-\ntion frameworks and guidelines for designing and implementing the\
    \ WSN sublayer.\n2.\nConcerning FM, most proposed schemes in the canon state of\
    \ the art are stand-\nalone, have high control message and computational complexities\
    \ (energy-inefﬁcient),\nand are mostly incompatible with the clustering architecture\
    \ [25,52]. The desired\nFM schemes for CA-IoT applications should be equipped\
    \ with fault-avoidance mech-\nIoT 2023, 4\n312\nanisms and the capacity to detect\
    \ and self-heal root faults (SN-out-of-service and\nsensory data outliers [25]),\
    \ not their effects.\n3.\nMultihop routing, which is a requirement to attain the\
    \ desired energy savings and\nnetwork adaptability in large-scale CA-IoT networks,\
    \ is asserted to be more energy-\nefﬁcient only in simulation experiments [33,120,121,123–125,128–130]\
    \ but not in real-\nworld implementation [22–24]. This imbalance is due to a lack\
    \ of a comprehensive\nand reliable theoretical multihop routing framework that\
    \ is based on the total commu-\nnication costs of multihop routing.\n4.\nThere\
    \ is a demand for a more realistic and holistic MOO framework that can op-\ntimize\
    \ the operational efﬁciency metrics such as cluster size, cluster counts, den-\n\
    sity/uniformity of nodes, communication distance, and activity schedule/duration,\n\
    right from the network design phase to the operational phase of Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    5.\nAlthough the current literature supports adaptive clustering with CH role\
    \ rotation\nideology, there exists the need for an optimal initial CH-count estimator\
    \ in order to\nimprove the stability of CH elections and the architecture. Thus,\
    \ the cluster quality\nindices (e.g., optimal cluster count and size) must be\
    \ predetermined before deﬁning\nthem in the associated CH election method, since\
    \ CH stability is compromised in most\nclustering methods [9,21,119–121,123,124].\n\
    6.\nMost protocols in the state of the art rely on perfect homogeneous networks,\
    \ which is\nunrealistic due to variations in modular specifications and resource\
    \ utilization and the\nfact that different SNs may have different communication\
    \ and data computational roles.\nTherefore, a more realistic, contextualized,\
    \ and adaptive clustering approach that leverages\nthe gap between the philosophy\
    \ and practice of Agri-IoT applications is needed.\n7.\nIn addition to the parent\
    \ LEACH protocol [21,61] which is a complete suite application\ncomprising routing,\
    \ MAC, and physical characteristics for wireless communication in\nWSNs, most\
    \ benchmarking MAC protocols purposed for traditional IoT applications\nare shelved,\
    \ since they are developed in solitude without application speciﬁcity and\nnetwork\
    \ architectural considerations. A custom-built and holistic protocol suite for\n\
    Agri-IoT remains a research opportunity.\n11. Conclusion and Future Works\nThis\
    \ tutorial presented: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts, tech-\n\
    nologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the tech-\nnical design requirements of a robust, ubiquitous, self-healing,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, adaptive,\nand affordable Agri-IoT; (3) a comprehensive survey\
    \ of the benchmarking FM techniques,\ncommunication standards, routing protocols,\
    \ MMAC protocols, and WSN-based testbed\nsolutions; and (4) an in-depth case study\
    \ on how to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, adaptive, stable,\
    \ and cluster-based WSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\ntaxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ that can guarantee optimized network performance. Further-\nmore, this tutorial\
    \ established new taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO\nmetrics\
    \ for CA-IoT networks. Using the open technical issues, it recommended application-\n\
    speciﬁc requirements of Agri-IoT, general design expectations, and remedial measures,\n\
    and it evaluated them in CA-IoT for precision irrigation in order to optimally\
    \ exploit the\nproposed MOO metrics in a typical CA-IoT design in both simulation\
    \ and real-world\ndeployment scenarios. Overall, this tutorial can serve as a\
    \ new reference document for the\nIoT community and Agri-IoT designers, since\
    \ it adequately examined all critical aspects of\nWSN-based Agri-IoT networks\
    \ from theoretical modeling to real-world implementation.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Tutorial on Agricultural IoT: Fundamental Concepts, Architectures, Routing, and
    Optimization. IoT 2023, 4, 265-318. Copy Abstract This paper presents an in-depth
    contextualized tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), covering the fundamental
    concepts, assessment of routing architectures and protocols, and performance optimization
    techniques via systematic survey and synthesis of related literature. The negative
    impacts of climate change and the increasing global population on food security
    and unemployment threats have motivated the adoption of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an indispensable underlying technology in precision agriculture
    and greenhouses to improve food production capacities and quality. However, most
    related Agri-IoT testbed solutions have failed to achieve their performance expectations
    due to the lack of an in-depth and contextualized reference tutorial that provides
    a holistic overview of communication technologies, routing architectures, and
    performance optimization modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although
    IoT applications are founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT)
    varies based on specific performance and users expectations as well as its technological,
    architectural, and deployment requirements. Likewise, the agricultural setting
    is a unique and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not apply,
    hence the need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these
    via the following contributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental
    concepts, technologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2)
    an evaluation of the technical design requirements of a robust, location-independent,
    and affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking fault
    tolerance techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control
    (MAC) protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth
    case study on how to design a self-healing, energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive,
    stable, autonomous, and cluster-based WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy
    of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics that can guarantee an optimized
    network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new taxonomies of
    faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)
    networks and a 3-tier objective framework with remedial measures for designing
    an efficient associated supervisory protocol for cluster-based Agri-IoT networks.

    \ Université Laval, Québec City, QC, Canada,\n2Department of Civil Engineering,\
    \ University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nReal-time soil matric potential measurements\
    \ for determining potato production’s\nwater availability are currently used in\
    \ precision irrigation. It is well known that\nmanaging irrigation based on soil\
    \ matric potential (SMP) helps increase water use\nefciency and reduce crop environmental\
    \ impact. Yet, SMP monitoring presents\nchallenges and sometimes leads to gaps\
    \ in the collected data. This research\nsought to address these data gaps in the\
    \ SMP time series. Using meteorological\nand ﬁeld measurements, we developed a\
    \ ﬁltering and imputation algorithm by\nimplementing three prominent predictive\
    \ models in the algorithm to estimate\nmissing values. Over 2 months, we gathered\
    \ hourly SMP values from a ﬁeld\nnorth of the Péribonka River in Lac-Saint-Jean,\
    \ Québec, Canada. Our study\nevaluated various data input combinations, including\
    \ only meteorological data,\nSMP measurements, or a mix of both. The Extreme Learning\
    \ Machine (ELM)\nmodel proved the most efective among the tested models. It outperformed\n\
    the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model and the Evolutionary Optimized Inverse\nDistance\
    \ Method (gaIDW). The ELM model, with ﬁve inputs comprising SMP\nmeasurements,\
    \ achieved a correlation coefcient of 0.992, a root-mean-square\nerror of 0.164\
    \ cm, a mean absolute error of 0.122 cm, and a Nash-Sutclife\nefciency of 0.983.\
    \ The ELM model requires at least ﬁve inputs to achieve the\nbest results in the\
    \ study context. These can be meteorological inputs like relative\nhumidity, dew\
    \ temperature, land inputs, or a combination of both. The results\nwere within\
    \ 5% of the best-performing input combination we identiﬁed earlier. To\nmitigate\
    \ the computational demands of these models, a quicker baseline model\ncan be\
    \ used for initial input ﬁltering. With this method, we expect the output\nfrom\
    \ simpler models such as gaIDW and kNN to vary by no more than 20%.\nNevertheless,\
    \ this discrepancy can be efciently managed by leveraging more\nsophisticated\
    \ models.\nKEYWORDS\nimputation, machine learning, modeling, hydro-informatics,\
    \ soil matric potential, water\nmanagement\n1. Introduction\nWater scarcity continues\
    \ to be a signiﬁcant barrier to agricultural productivity.\nEnhancing the eﬃciency\
    \ of water use in agriculture is a crucial challenge to achieve higher\ncrop yields\
    \ (Molden et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2018; Matteau et al., 2021). Despite agriculture\n\
    being the primary consumer of the Earth’s freshwater, competition from other sectors\
    \ is\nintensifying. Governments frequently advocate for improved irrigation eﬃciency\
    \ to balance\nthis demand (FAO, 2008).\nFrontiers in Water\n01\nfrontiersin.org\n\
    Zeynoddin et al.\n10.3389/frwa.2023.1237592\nReal-time Soil Matric Potential (SMP)\
    \ measurements are\nessential in this context. Irrigation management strategies\
    \ based on\nSMP can enhance water productivity and increase yield (Matteau\net\
    \ al., 2021, 2022b). However, crops’ optimal irrigation thresholds\nbased on SMP\
    \ vary (Rekika et al., 2014; Létourneau et al.,\n2015; Périard et al., 2015).\
    \ Consequently, personalized irrigation\nstrategies based on crop-speciﬁc SMP\
    \ ranges can help prevent over-\nirrigation or water deﬁciency (Matteau et al.,\
    \ 2022a). Yet, SMP\nreal-time measurements can generate unstructured and messy\
    \ data\nimpairing decision-making and predictive modeling performance\n(Kamilaris\
    \ and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018). These unstructured and\nmissing data (UMD) impede\
    \ the eﬀective implementation of data-\ndriven methods, like precision agriculture\
    \ and machine learning,\nleading to less-than-optimal farming strategies and ineﬃcient\n\
    resource utilization. This issue is especially pressing given the need\nfor sustainable\
    \ farming practices to meet increasing global food\ndemand while minimizing environmental\
    \ impacts (Godfray et al.,\n2010).\nUMD, often a result of equipment failure,\
    \ data entry errors,\nor data loss, is another pressing issue, particularly given\
    \ that\nmeasurements are taken under conditions heavily inﬂuenced by\nnatural\
    \ environmental circumstances (Di Piazza, 2011; Fountas\net al., 2015; Wolfert\
    \ et al., 2017; Bleidorn et al., 2022). Dealing\nwith missing data eﬀectively\
    \ reduces estimation bias and improves\nparameter accuracy (Rouzinov and Berchtold,\
    \ 2022).\nSeveral strategies exist to address UMD. The primary strategy\nis deletion\
    \ when data are missing at random and unrelated to the\nvariable itself (Allison,\
    \ 2003) or the missing rate is <5% (Dong and\nPeng, 2013). However, when the missing\
    \ rate surpasses 10%, biased\nresults are likely (Bennett, 2001). In such situations,\
    \ statistical\nand artiﬁcial estimation methods prove useful. For instance, in\n\
    environmental research, it is often assumed that neighboring sites\ncan signiﬁcantly\
    \ contribute to data reconstruction (Cheng and Lu,\n2017). Therefore, spatial\
    \ and temporal interpolation methods are\ncommonly used (Tonini et al., 2016;\
    \ Tipton et al., 2017).\nNotably, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), kriging, and\n\
    cokriging methods, along with their variants, are widely adopted\nfor this purpose\
    \ (Eskelson et al., 2009; Bhattacharjee et al., 2014).\nAmong them, IDW methods\
    \ like harmony search-IDW, genetic\nalgorithm (ga)-IDW, and particle swarm-IDW\
    \ are the most reliable\nfor estimating missing environmental data (Chang et al.,\
    \ 2005;\nGholipour et al., 2013; Li and Wang, 2013; Barbulescu et al., 2020).\n\
    E.g., Bárbulescu et al. (2021) aﬃrmed the reliability of gaIDW,\ndemonstrating\
    \ that its accuracy surpassed other methods in 70%\nof study cases.\nOther statistical\
    \ methods for imputation include seasonal\nand nonseasonal autoregressive integrated\
    \ moving average models\n(Yozgatligil et al., 2013), autoregressive models with\
    \ exogenous\nvariables (Bidwell, 2005), principal component regression, and\n\
    maximum likelihood methods (Enders and Bandalos, 2001). The\nk-Nearest Neighbors\
    \ (kNN) model, a popular statistical space-\nbased model, has proven robust, reliable,\
    \ and simple-structured\nand surpasses many average-based methods in dealing with\
    \ missing\nvalues (Troyanskaya et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2004; Cordeiro et al.,\n\
    2022).\nIn artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), many methods have been\ndeveloped for\
    \ imputing missing data. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\n(ANNs), evolutionary polynomial\
    \ regression, vector autoregressive\nimputation methods, and complex deep learning\
    \ models like\nrecurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and\n\
    long-short term memory models (Zhou and Zhang, 2022) are\nstandard AI methods\
    \ used in this ﬁeld. Among these, the Extreme\nLearning Machine (ELM) is unique\
    \ due to its simple structure, ease\nof parameter tuning, fast training process,\
    \ and better scalability\nand generalizability than other AI methods, such as\
    \ support vector\nmachines. It can generate accurate results with minimal data\n\
    (Huang et al., 2012; Huang, 2015; Evans et al., 2020).\nGiven the signiﬁcance\
    \ of SMP in agricultural practices and the\nimperative of managing UMD data, this\
    \ research seeks to develop\nand compare models and an algorithm that chooses\
    \ optimal inputs\nfor modeling UMD data. We intend to review diﬀerent inputs\n\
    used in deterministic and AI methods and interpret the results\nof our algorithm,\
    \ which assesses and selects the best input-model\ncombination. Considering the\
    \ extensive literature review, features\nof the models, and comprehensive research\
    \ on optimal input\nselection, gaIDW, kNN, and ELM were chosen for imputing the\n\
    SMP dataset in this study. These models are fast, widely used, and\nhave demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy. Notably, apart from kNN,\nwhich was used in Cordeiro et al.\
    \ (2022), these methods have yet\nto be previously employed for imputing SMPs\
    \ or compared against\neach other.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Extreme learning\
    \ machine\nThe feed-forward neural network (FFNN) with the integrated\nbackpropagation\
    \ (BP) training method is a popular neural network\nused in research due to its\
    \ impressive ability to solve complex\nnon-linear problems. This combination allows\
    \ for the eﬀective\noptimization of network weight and bias, non-linear mapping\
    \ over\ninput/output parameters, and the creation of ﬂexible models, which\nis\
    \ not achievable with traditional regression approaches. However,\nthis method\
    \ is known for its time-consuming training process,\nthe potential to become trapped\
    \ in local minima, and numerous\nconﬁgurable model parameters. This approach’s\
    \ drawbacks were\nnoted in previous studies (Bonakdari et al., 2020a,b).\nTo address\
    \ the limitations of the FFNN approach, a new\napproach called the extreme learning\
    \ machine (ELM) was\nintroduced. The ELM is a single-neuron training approach\
    \ for\nFFNNs, where a hidden neuron bias and input weights are chosen\nstochastically,\
    \ and the output weights are determined by solving a\nlinear problem. The change\
    \ from a non-linear system to a linear\nsystem accelerates the training speed\
    \ of the ELM. Additionally,\nthe only variable in this strategy is the number\
    \ of hidden neurons\n(Zeynoddin et al., 2018). The single-layer FFNN ELM formula\
    \ is\nas follows:\nTVi=\nXh\nj=1 OpWj f (IpWj.INVi+bi), i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , s\n\
    (1)\nIn the present study, the activation function is denoted by f(.), the\noutput\
    \ weight matrix is represented by OPWj, h is the number of\nhidden neurons, the\
    \ input weights matrix is IpWj, TVi refers to the\ntarget parameter, s represents\
    \ the number of input variables, and\nFrontiers in Water\n02\nfrontiersin.org\n\
    Zeynoddin et al.\n10.3389/frwa.2023.1237592\nINVi denotes the input variables.\
    \ The sigmoid activation function\nis chosen in this investigation based on its\
    \ strong performance\nin previous studies reviewed in the literature. The function\
    \ is\ndescribed as follows (Azimi et al., 2017; Yaseen et al., 2018; Ebtehaj\n\
    et al., 2019):\nfα (TVi) =\n1\n1 + e−TVi\n(2)\nTo enhance the generalizability\
    \ of the ELM model and minimize\nthe impact of randomly selected input weights\
    \ and bias, the\niterative procedure outlined by Ebtehaj et al. (2021) is employed\n\
    in this study. One thousand iterations were also used to ﬁnd the\noptimal weights.\n\
    2.2. Optimized inverse distance weighted\nmethod\n2.2.1. Inverse distance weighted\
    \ method\nProblems associated with data measurement most commonly\nresult in missing\
    \ observations. These problems include insuﬃcient\nmeasurement tools, site access\
    \ limitations, systematic or operator-\nsourced errors, and expenditures. Using\
    \ two broad categories of\ndeterministic and geostatistical methodologies, researchers\
    \ have\nworked to create mathematical and statistical strategies to address\n\
    these ﬂaws and represent hydrological events with models that\ncan be understood\
    \ and interpreted. Regarding mathematical\nequations and measured points, deterministic\
    \ techniques such\nas the inverse distance weight (IDW), splines, local polynomial\n\
    interpolation, radial basis functions, natural neighbors, and the\nThiessen technique\
    \ have been established, which are based on\nstatistical notions and geostatistical\
    \ approaches (Azari et al., 2021).\nThe IDW approach was used in the present investigation\
    \ to impute\ndata from measurement points with missing data. The relationship\n\
    used in this method is as follows:\nTVi, j =\nPN\ni=1\n\x10 INVi, j\nDα\ni\n\x11\
    \nPN\ni=1\n\x10\n1\nDα\ni\n\x11\n(3)\nwhere TVi,j,τ is the imputed value, INVi,j,τ\
    \ denotes the target\nvariable at point TVi at time step j, Di is the distance\
    \ of points\nwith available data at the same time step as the target point, N\
    \ is\nthe length of each sample, and α is the weighting parameter. The\nparameter\
    \ α determines the quantity of available data depending on\ntheir distance from\
    \ the location with missing data. In this way, for\nα larger than one, closer\
    \ sites receive greater weights than faraway\nsites. The normal range for the\
    \ parameter α is [0, 2], where 0\nindicates a simple average without aﬀecting\
    \ the distance feature and\n2 indicates that greater weights are used for close\
    \ sites (Ly et al.,\n2011; Azari et al., 2021). Its value is generally determined\
    \ based\non trial and error and evaluation criteria such as cross-validation.\n\
    This method is limited to land data, and other inputs, such as\nmeteorological\
    \ variables, cannot be used.\n2.2.2. Optimization process\nIn this study, a reliable\
    \ evolutionary optimization approach\nis used to approximate the most accurate\
    \ α by taking historical\nvalues into account. For this purpose, a genetic algorithm\
    \ (ga) is\nused to optimize α. Darwin’s idea of evolution, which enhances\nsurvival\
    \ via reproduction, crossover, and gene mutation, inspired\nthe genetic algorithm.\
    \ Population solutions, such as natural\nchromosomes, are used to start the algorithm.\
    \ Gene encoding, the\ninitial stage of using a ga, is a technique for building\
    \ decision\nvariables equivalent to the genes in chromosomes. The ga imitates\n\
    reproduction, crossover, and mutation to sustain superior solutions\nand create\
    \ better oﬀspring to get closer to the objective function.\nThis technique helps\
    \ select and create a new population. The\nobjective function ranks the generated\
    \ population. Gene evolution\neliminates the worst individuals and selects better\
    \ individuals that\nﬁt the objective function. Accordingly, the GA simpliﬁes power\n\
    parameter tuning. Diﬀerent values for tuning the GA parameters\nare used to optimize\
    \ the IDW method. For instance, Chang\net al. (2005) used a population size of\
    \ 20, an α search space of\n[0, 10], and 150 maximum generations. Bárbulescu et\
    \ al. (2021)\ninvestigated diﬀerent values of the population size [10, 80], number\n\
    of generations (maximum 10), mutation rate (<0.1), and crossover\nrate [0.6, 1].\
    \ They reported that high values of the population\ndo not aﬀect the model outcomes\
    \ signiﬁcantly. The fewest errors\nwere generated with a population size of [35,\
    \ 45], between 5 and\n9 generations, a mutation rate within [0.04, 0.08], and\
    \ a crossover\nrate within [0.6, 0.8] for diﬀerent crossover/mutation methods.\n\
    According to the reported values and with the aim of increasing\nthe search space,\
    \ the search space for feasible values of α is\n>0 (1e−5) with feasible adaptive\
    \ mutation, a maximum of 100\ngenerations, a population of 50, and a crossover\
    \ rate of 0.8. The\nmean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME), and root-mean-\n\
    square error (MAE) are the conventional objective functions used\n(Chang et al.,\
    \ 2005). Consequently, the RMSE is also set as the\nobjective function.\n2.3.\
    \ k-nearest neighbors\nk-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a widely used reliable technique\n\
    among data imputation methods (Troyanskaya et al., 2001; Kim\net al., 2004; Cordeiro\
    \ et al., 2022). This method is similar\nin its basic ideas to IDW. When using\
    \ the kNN technique,\nmissing time steps are ﬁlled in using data from the next\n\
    neighboring site/column dataset. To approximate the degree\nto which two values\
    \ are close to one another, the Euclidean\ndistance is utilized. Each neighbor’s\
    \ compared value must have\nthe same dimension and time step. The missing value\
    \ is\nimputed using the weighted average of the k-nearest values\nin the relevant\
    \ column. The weights are calculated by the\nfollowing equation:\nkWi =\n1i, j\n\
    EDi\nPN\ni=1\n\x10\n1\nEDi\n\x11\n(4)\nwhere\nkWi\ndenotes\nthe\nweights\napplied\n\
    to\nthe\nk-nearest\ncolumn\nto\nimpute\nthe\ndata,\nand\nEDi\nis\nthe\nEuclidean\n\
    distance between the target datasets and the other datasets\nwith the same time\
    \ stamp. A limitation of this method\nFrontiers in Water\n03\nfrontiersin.org\n\
    Zeynoddin et al.\n10.3389/frwa.2023.1237592\nis that there should be at least\
    \ one row of datasets with\naccurate values.\n3. Method analysis and workﬂow\n\
    The advantage of the kNN method compared to the other\ntwo methods is the simplicity\
    \ and the low degree of freedom\nof the model. However, the main problem with\
    \ IDW and kNN\nmethods is the uncertainty in choosing the number of neighbors\n\
    or, in other words, the number of model inputs. These methods\nare deterministic\
    \ and are less ﬂexible than other methods when\nreceiving diﬀerent inputs of diﬀerent\
    \ natures and establishing\na meaningful relationship between these inputs and\
    \ the target\nvariable. In addition to the problem of the uncertainty of input\n\
    selection, the IDW model faces the problem of the uncertainty of\nthe α tuning\
    \ parameter. Although this problem can be solved by\nadding an optimization technique,\
    \ the parameters of the optimizer\nadd further complexity.\nThe ELM model has\
    \ more complexity in terms of structure and\napplicability than the other two\
    \ models. This characteristic makes\nthe model much better than the other two\
    \ methods at establishing\na relationship between the inputs and target values.\
    \ However,\nthis method also has the problem of uncertain inputs, along\nwith\
    \ uncertain model tuning parameters, and is computationally\nexpensive compared\
    \ to the other two methods.\nTherefore, in this research, the aim is to compare\
    \ the models\nand develop an algorithm based on which diﬀerent inputs to\nthe\
    \ models are checked, where the best ones are ﬁltered out\nafter modeling based\
    \ on evaluation criteria. The possibility of\nusing diﬀerent inputs when reconstructing\
    \ UMD data for the\ndeterministic methods introduced is reviewed. Finally, the\
    \ results of\nthe developed algorithm, which produces all possible combinations\n\
    of inputs for the models and selects the best input and model,\nare interpreted\
    \ and evaluated. All the models and the search\nalgorithm are coded in the MATLAB\
    \ environment. Figure 1 shows\nthe workﬂow of this research.\n4. Evaluation criteria\n\
    To assess the eﬀectiveness of the models and contrast the\nresults, a thorough\
    \ assessment of the models is carried out utilizing\ncorrelation, absolute and\
    \ relative error, complexity indices, and\nother visual metrics. The root-mean-square\
    \ error (RMSE), mean\nabsolute error (MAE), and correlation coeﬃcient (R) are\
    \ calculated\naccordingly. Another method for calculating model diﬀerences\nis\
    \ the Nash-Sutcliﬀe eﬃciency (NSE). This index, a normalized\nmethod, assesses\
    \ the residuals’ variance with respect to a reference\nsample. It ranges from\
    \ –∞ to 1, with 1 being the ideal eﬃciency/ﬁt.\nThe NSE is, in general, comparable\
    \ to the R index. However,\nit assesses the model’s eﬀectiveness and performance\
    \ quality and\nreﬂects more precisely the desirable and undesirable aspects of\n\
    the model under discussion. As a result, it is a useful metric\nfor assessing\
    \ how well a model performs in comparison to a\nbenchmark model.\nR =\n\0Pn\n\

    5. Study ﬁeld and measurement\nmethod\nThe study ﬁeld is located north of the\
    \ Péribonka River, Saint-\nJean Lake, Quebec Province, Canada. The measurement\
    \ sites\nextend from 71.9992◦ to 71.9908◦ west and from 48.7437◦ to\n48.7540◦\
    \ north. There are a total of 12 measurement sites in the\nstudy ﬁeld. The ﬁeld\
    \ and measurement site locations are shown\nin Figure 2. Because of the large\
    \ number of missing values in the\nrecords of one sensor, and to enable consistent\
    \ training and testing\nresearch hypothesis evaluation, the associated recording\
    \ is removed\nfrom the study datasets. Along with the land measurements, four\n\
    meteorological (meteo) variables are also measured for the study\nﬁeld. These\
    \ variables are wind speed (WS), relative humidity\n(RH), dew, and 2 m air temperatures\
    \ (DT and AT) for the\nperiod of the study. These values are measured on an hourly\n\
    basis from July to August 2022. The statistical features of the\nrecords are shown\
    \ in Figure 3. The soil matric potential (SMP)\nwas measured continuously with\
    \ commercial tensiometers (HXM-\n80, Hortau Inc., Lévis, Québec, Canada) connected\
    \ to the same\nST-4 datalogger. The tensiometers were located at the positions\n\
    displayed in Figure 3 at a depth of 15 cm below the ground.\nTo test the methods\
    \ presented in this study, an interval in which\nall time series had reliable\
    \ values was chosen, and the time steps of\nmissing values were removed from all\
    \ time series. Therefore, 678\ndata points for each time series remained. Seventy\
    \ percent of the\ndatasets were used in the training section, and the remaining\
    \ thirty\npercent were used for model evaluation. The size of the test portion\n\
    was selected based on the maximum rate of missing data and was\nchosen randomly\
    \ to simulate real conditions. To choose the target\nsite, the site with the least\
    \ correlation with the others was selected as\nthe target (T) (Figure 3). The\
    \ inputs were standardized before being\nused in the modeling process.\nFrontiers\

    FIGURE 1\nFlowchart of the studied methodology.\n6. Results\nTwo general scenarios\
    \ are deﬁned for imputation, as shown\nin Figure 1. In the ﬁrst scenario, the\
    \ models generate imputations\nbased on all inputs, and each input combination\
    \ is ﬁltered out\nafter modeling based on the indices. The inputs diﬀer based\
    \ on the\nmodel’s structure and the capability of processing inputs of diﬀerent\n\
    natures. Therefore, kNN and the ELM modeled the target with 14\ninputs, including\
    \ all meteo and land measurements. On the other\nhand, gaIDW modeled the target\
    \ only with land measurements.\nAll combinations of these inputs were analyzed\
    \ and ﬁltered out,\nresulting in 16,383 models for the ELM and kNN and 1,023 models\n\
    for gaIDW. These tasks were performed on a computer with an\nIntel Core i7 processor\
    \ and 16 gigabytes of RAM, resulting in\n10.83 h of processing time for the ELM,\
    \ 0.05 h for kNN and 8.42 h\nfor gaIDW.\nA graphical representation of the performance\
    \ of the models\nis shown in Figure 4 for all generated models. The Violin\nplots\
    \ show the distribution and other statistical features of the\ncalculated performance\
    \ indices (R, MSE, etc.) for the models with\nindependent input data. A violin\
    \ plot combines aspects of a box\nplot and a kernel density plot to display model\
    \ distribution and\nsummary statistics. The width of the violin at diﬀerent points\n\
    represents the density or frequency of data values. The high median\nof the ELM\
    \ in terms of R and its low values of RMSE, MAE,\nand NSE suggest better performance\
    \ for this model, followed by\nkNN and gaIDW. The ELM was successful in creating\
    \ relationships\namong all inputs in all combinations. The bimodal distribution\
    \ of\nindices for the ELM and kNN show their higher sensitivity to the\ninputs\
    \ compared to that of gaIDW. The uniform and narrower\nviolin body of gaIDW (in\
    \ RMSE, MAE, and NSE) indicates less\nvariability in the model results. None of\
    \ the models generated\noutlier results, indicating the procedure’s reliability.\
    \ According to\nthese plots, the performance of the ELM model was more accurate,\n\
    followed by kNN and gaIDW, in general.\nAs mentioned earlier, this study aims\
    \ to assess the possibility\nof constructing values of diﬀerent locations in the\
    \ ﬁeld with\nminimum inputs. Therefore, the three subscenarios of modeling\nwith\
    \ meteo+land inputs, land inputs, and meteo inputs are deﬁned.\nAfter assessing\
    \ all models for diﬀerent input groups, the best\ncombinations of each group (for\
    \ instance, 1-input, 2-inputs, ...,\n14-inputs) are ﬁltered out based on the accuracy\
    \ indices for\neach model, and the results of superior combinations are shown\n\
    in Figure 5. This ﬁgure shows the overall performance of the\nthree models with\
    \ diﬀerent input combinations. The detailed\nresults are shown in Tables A1–A3.\
    \ In all three subscenarios, the\nELM performed better than kNN and gaIDW. Following\
    \ relative\nimprovements and alternations of the models for diﬀerent sub-\nscenarios\
    \ are provided. In the chosen 14 superior combinations,\nthe ELM, compared to\
    \ kNN, is on average more accurate, with\nR = 37%, RMSE = −74%, MAE = −76%, and\
    \ NSE = 85%,\nin the meteo+land subscenario. In the meteo subscenario, the\nELM,\
    \ compared to kNN, is, on average, more accurate with R =\n37%, RMSE = −37%, MAE\
    \ = −45%, and NSE = −130%. In the\nlast subscenario (land inputs), the ELM, compared\
    \ to kNN, is on\naverage more accurate, with R = 33%, RMSE = −73%, MAE =\n−76%,\
    \ and NSE = 79%, and compared to gaIDW, it is more precise,\nwith R = 54%, RMSE\
    \ = −77%, MAE = −80%, and NSE = 175%.\nkNN, compared to gaIDW, is also, on average,\
    \ more accurate with\nR = 16%, RMSE = −16%, MAE = −17%, and NSE = 54%.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of estimations for the ELM model increased\nwhen increasing the number of inputs\
    \ to 5, and after that, the\naccuracy decreased slightly with the increase in\
    \ the number of\ninputs. The ELM estimated the target variable most accurately\n\

    \ MAE\n= 0.122, and NSE = 0.983. In the ﬁrst 5 combinations\n(CML\nE 1-CML\nE\
    \ 5), only land measurements were involved, and after\nthat, meteo+land combinations\
    \ yielded slightly more accurate\nresults than the land inputs alone, so they\
    \ can be used\ninterchangeably and are considerably more accurate than only\n\
    meteo inputs. The RH, AT, and DT are more involved in\nthe meteo+land combinations\
    \ than in the other meteo inputs\n(Table A1).\nConversely, the accuracy of estimations\
    \ for the kNN model\ndecreased when increasing the number of inputs in both the\n\
    meteo+land and land subscenarios. The kNN results were obtained\nusing a coeﬃcient\
    \ of one land input, with a maximum accuracy\nof R = 0.937, RMSE = 0.455, MAE\
    \ = 0.336, and NSE =\n0.873. The meteo inputs are involved in 3-input combinations\n\
    and above. With the addition of meteo inputs, kNN generated\nmore accurate estimations\
    \ compared to only land or only\nmeteo inputs. The RH and WS for meteo inputs\
    \ were more\nimportant input variables than the other two meteo variables\nin\
    \ kNN modeling (Table A2). gaIDW also followed the same\naccuracy decrease pattern\
    \ as kNN. The best result for this model\nwas obtained with one input, and using\
    \ all neighbor records\ndecreased the accuracy to half, as demonstrated in the\
    \ results of\nTable A3.\nThe second scenario consists of primary input ﬁltering\
    \ and\nuse in other models. The processing time for diﬀerent models\nwas mentioned\
    \ above, and it was noted that a model such as\ngaIDW or the ELM could be computationally\
    \ expensive. Therefore,\nit is reasonable to use a powerful model to determine\
    \ the best\ninput combinations and use them in other modeling methods for\nfuture\
    \ applications. The ELM model proved to be robust in ﬁnding\nconnections among\
    \ diﬀerent inputs in the previous step, while\nthe other models generated relatively\
    \ naïve results. In this step,\nthe ELM is used as a benchmark model to obtain\
    \ the primary\nestimations and ﬁlter out combinations. Then, these combinations\n\
    are used in the other two models to see how much they deviate from\nthe benchmark\
    \ model and their results in the previous step. The\nresults depicted in Figure\
    \ 6 reveal that a similar pattern of accuracy\nchanges can be observed in the\
    \ ﬁxed-input scenario as the number\nof inputs increases. The gap between the\
    \ three models is almost the\nsame as the previous one.\nFollowing, the comparison\

    for this modeling scenario compared to the previous one. However,\nR and NSE have\
    \ drastic changes in some cases. Figure 7 shows the\nchange rates in the indices\
    \ when a ﬁxed-input scenario is used. It\ncan be seen that both the kNN and gaIDW\
    \ models’ results diﬀer\nby a maximum of 20% in R, RMSE, and MAE, except for models\n\
    with only meteo inputs. However, the eﬃciency of these models has\nconsiderable\
    \ changes, as it can deviate by up to 40% from the base\nmodel in the meteo+land\
    \ subscenario.\nFigure 8 shows the statistical features of the superior models\
    \ for\neach modeling method in both scenarios. A powerful model should\nalso be\
    \ able to reproduce the statistical characteristics of the target\nseries (Zeynoddin\
    \ and Bonakdari, 2022, 2023). It should be able\nto estimate the series’ mean,\
    \ median, and distribution, as well as\nregenerate any outliers. Therefore, box-density\
    \ plots of the target\nand models are presented in Figure 8. It can be observed\
    \ that all\nmodels estimated the core features of the target with a high degree\n\
    of accuracy. The interquartile area and extremes were reproduced\nwith very good\
    \ accuracy. However, only the ELM model was able\nto estimate all the outliers\
    \ of the target series. The scatter plots\nalso show that the chosen models could\
    \ produce a majority of\nestimations of the target with 95% intervals.\nIn all\

    \ target compared to the others,\nas shown in Figure 3. If this input was excluded\
    \ from the input\ncombinations, the best results of the ELM model would be the\
    \ [1,\n3, 7, 11, 13] combination with R = 0.975, RMSE = 0.287, MAE\n= 0.229, and\
    \ NSE = 0.949, which is very close to the best result\nin Table A1. In this combination,\
    \ two meteo inputs (RH and DT)\nand three land measurements are involved. With\
    \ one input, the\nbest results would be [9], with R = 0.655, RMSE = 0.972, MAE\n\
    = 0.808, and NSE = 0.420, which is considerably lower than the\nothers. With two\
    \ inputs, the best ELM results would be [7, 12],\nwith R = 0.885, RMSE = 0. 603,\
    \ MAE = 0. 482, and NSE = 0.\n777, and with three inputs, the best ELM results\
    \ would be [3, 7,\n12], with R = 0. 945, RMSE = 0. 418, MAE = 0. 328, and NSE\
    \ =\n0. 893.\nThe RH and DT meteo input and records at sites 7,\n11, 12, and 13\
    \ are the most important input variables for\nestimating the target. For the ELM\
    \ model to provide the best\nresults with a maximum of 5% diﬀerence compared to\
    \ the\nbest input combination, it needs at least 5 inputs, which can\nbe diﬀerent\
    \ combinations of the meteo and land inputs, as\nshown earlier. With the same\
    \ exclusion assumption (removing\ninput 8), kNN’s best result would be the [4,\
    \ 5, 9] combination,\nwith R = 0.497, RMSE = 1.151, MAE = 0.930, and NSE\n= 0.187.\
    \ Removing input 8 from the combinations greatly\naﬀects the results of kNN. Similar\
    \ to kNN, the gaIDW results\nwould be impacted signiﬁcantly by removing input\
    \ 8. The\noutcome of this model after removing input 8 is R = 0.553,\nRMSE = 1.219,\
    \ MAE = 1.032, and NSE = 0.087. This model\ngenerates almost identical results\
    \ for inputs 5, 9, 11, and\n13, regardless of the number of inputs or the combination\n\
    of them.\n7. Discussion\nUsing the nearest adjacent sites for data reconstruction\
    \ is a\ncommon approach, and it can be eﬀective in certain cases. The\ngeneral\
    \ rule of thumb is based on the assumption that adjacent\nsites are more likely\
    \ to have similar characteristics or behavior,\nwhich makes them potentially suitable\
    \ for imputing missing data.\nHowever, it is important to note that this rule\
    \ may not always\nhold true, and there are several factors to consider when deciding\n\
    whether to use adjacent sites for data reconstruction, such as\nspatial relationships,\
    \ the homogeneity of the study area, temporal\nrelationships, data quality and\
    \ consistency (Eskelson et al., 2009;\nCarvalho et al., 2016; Cheng and Lu, 2017;\
    \ Liu et al., 2020). All these\nconditions apply to the data used. However, the\
    \ adjacent sites were\nless eﬀective than the others in imputing the missing values\
    \ in this\ncase study. Figure 9 shows the aﬀecting inputs for all three models\n\
    with and without input 8. This ﬁgure shows the relative positions\nof the inputs\
    \ to the target.\nThe application of SMP in precision agriculture, water\nmanagement,\
    \ and hydrological studies is extensive. But the\nchallenges in using this parameter\
    \ and handling UMD are\nsigniﬁcant. Following, a few studies are presented that\
    \ encountered\nUMD. Our ﬁndings in the context of these studies, as proper\nimputation\
    \ of SMP by proposed methods, could enhance water\nuse eﬃciency in precision irrigation\
    \ and hydrological assessments.\nBorken et al. (2000), while studying the inﬂuence\
    \ of rainfall on\ndistribution in the CH4 oxidation in an ecosystem, found a strong\n\

    FIGURE 5\nModel results for independent input scenarios, C represents the combinations\
    \ presented in Tables A1–A3.\nSMP measurements in the neighborhood, as discussed\
    \ here, could\nprovide better insight for their study, considering a correlation\n\
    of 0.89 between parameters. Similarly, when Nzokou et al. (2010)\nfaced the problem\
    \ of missing and erroneous data while logging\nSMP for automated irrigation and\
    \ management of trees, they could\ncompensate the UMD by using logged data by\
    \ other wired sensors.\nAI methods’ results are dependent on the inputs and their\
    \ inherent\nerrors. When modeling a soil parameter with these methods, the\nnumber\
    \ of inputs gains importance. So, Cordeiro et al. (2022) could\ndecrease the number\
    \ of inputs in their model by increasing the\naccuracy of the imputed features\
    \ by kNN.\nBased on the results of the ﬁxed-input scenario, 20% changes\nin model\
    \ outcomes such as R, RMSE, and MSE can be expected.\nAs kNN is considerably faster\
    \ than the ELM and gaIDW, it can\nbe used as a ﬁltering model to ﬁnd the best\
    \ input, and the ELM\nor other more complex non-linear models can be used to impute\n\
    the datasets. With this approach, the computational problem can\nbe handled. The\
    \ limitations of this study can be addressed as\nfollows. The models used in this\
    \ study are data-driven and are\ninﬂuenced by the quality of the data, the number\
    \ of inputs, and\nhyperparameters adjustment, like gaIDW. Accordingly, in case\
    \ the\nstructure of the time series varies in diﬀerent timeframes, the\nresults\
    \ will be aﬀected, speciﬁcally in simple-structured models\nlike IDW or kNN. Although\
    \ the proposed ﬁltering algorithm, as\ninvestigating all possible input combinations\
    \ and ﬁltering superior\nones by a fast model and using them in a more complex\
    \ model\nlike ELM, other machine learning methods or even deep learning\nmethods,\
    \ is applicable to all types of time series and diﬀerent\nstructures. Spatial\
    \ models like gaIDW are also limited to in-situ\ninputs. This research studied\
    \ a wide range of diﬀerent combinations\nof inputs of diﬀerent natures. These\
    \ inputs were data that have been\ncommonly examined in various studies and are\
    \ readily available.\nHowever, there might be other relevant variables that were\
    \ not\nconsidered. Based on the addressed limitations, for future studies,\nit\
    \ is suggested that support vector machines, group methods of data\nhandling,\
    \ or even convolutional neural networks, which are more\ncomplicated machine learning\
    \ methods, be considered as other AI\nmethods in SMP imputation. Therefore, a\
    \ comparison of diﬀerent\nAI methods in SMP estimation in diﬀerent climatic conditions\n\
    can also be provided. Adding diﬀerent inputs to the input set\ncan also expand\
    \ the search space for the best input combinations,\nwhich increases the chance\
    \ of ﬁnding other estimation possibilities.\nFrontiers in Water\n09\nfrontiersin.org\n\

    \ scenarios, C represents the combinations presented in Tables A1–A3.\nHowever,\
    \ based on the ﬁndings of this study, exclusively using\nvariables such as meteorological\
    \ data as input for imputation,\nwhich have a diﬀerent nature than the target\
    \ variable, does not yield\naccurate results; instead, they need to be combined\
    \ with land data to\nimprove accuracy, as was observed in the meteo subscenario.\
    \ This\napproach generates more accurate outcomes than only taking land\nmeasurements\
    \ as the inputs.\n8. Conclusion\nWater management is vital for precise irrigation\
    \ guidelines,\nenhancing\npotato\ncrop\nproductivity,\nand\noptimizing\nwater\n\
    consumption. Real-time soil matric potential (SMP) can improve\nwater use eﬃciency.\
    \ However, the ability to record this variable\nis constrained, leading to UMD\
    \ data in the associated time series.\nIn this study, a comparison of three models\
    \ and the development\nof an algorithm were investigated, based on which a thorough\n\
    analysis of inputs was performed to determine the possibility\nof imputing missing\
    \ values in datasets with meteorological or\nﬁeld measurements. Four meteorological\
    \ variables and ten ﬁeld\nmeasurements, constituting 16,383 distinct combinations,\
    \ were\nused to reconstruct the missing values. In these scenarios, sole\nmeteorological,\
    \ sole land, and combinations of both types of\nvariables were investigated. The\
    \ results of applying the ELM, kNN,\nand gaIDW in two diﬀerent scenarios and three\
    \ subscenarios\nshowed that the ELM model outperformed kNN and gaIDW with\n5 inputs\
    \ consisting of land measurements. Based on a search\nof the models’ results for\
    \ input alternatives, it was determined\nthat the ELM model requires a minimum\
    \ of 5 inputs, which\ncan be combinations of RH and DT meteorological variables\
    \ and\nland inputs, to achieve optimal results within 5% of the best\ninput combination\
    \ found earlier. The best kNN outcome was\nobtained for one land input. Combining\
    \ meteorological variables as\nmeteo+land inputs, enhanced the model outputs.\
    \ gaIDW method\nproduced the best results with the same land input as that of\
    \ kNN\nand almost identical indices. It was observed that the adjacent sites\n\
    were not as eﬀective as the others in imputing the missing values,\nFrontiers\

    \ investigated.\nComputational cost is a problem for AI models that was mentioned\n\
    earlier. To solve this problem, a fast base model can be used to\nﬁlter the inputs.\
    \ With this approach, a maximum 20% diﬀerence\nin the results of simple-structured\
    \ models such as gaIDW and kNN\ncould be expected. However, this issue can be\
    \ addressed with more\ncomplex models, such as stochastic models or other AI models,\n\
    like group methods of data handling. Exclusively using variables\nsuch as meteorological\
    \ data as input for imputation, which have\na diﬀerent nature than the target\
    \ variable, does not yield accurate\nresults; instead, they need to be combined\
    \ with land data to improve\naccuracy, as was observed in the meteo subscenario.\n\

    V.R.Q. A Rapid Review on the Use of Free and Open Source Technologies and Software
    Applied to Precision Agriculture Practices. J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2023, 12,
    28. Abstract Agricultural production needs technologies that assist the management
    of natural resources, for example, the collection of real-time data on soil, water,
    weather, crops, and biodiversity conditions. Sensor technology solutions and open-source
    software are appropriate for promoting more sustainable agricultural production.
    Among the advantages of using open-source technologies and software is its potential
    for extension, collaboration, customization, flexibility, maintenance cost, transparency,
    speed, and better security. Given the above, the objective of this research was
    to find, in different electronic databases, exclusively open-source software for
    precision agriculture, offering a systematic review, and addressing considerations
    and challenges. This survey considers up-to-date open-source software available
    in repositories such as GitHub and GitLab, to understand its characteristics and
    application formats. Keywords precision agriculture; open source software; open

    \ this work would not be possible. \nFirstly, thanks to all my family, parents,\
    \ Aurea and Blas,  brothers, Paulo, \nJosé and Celeste, grandparents, uncles,\
    \ cousins, and those families and friends that \nthe blood does not relate us,\
    \ but the souls do it in such as strong bound. Thanks for \nall you shared with\
    \ me, happy moments (and sad moments, I’m sure there are, but \nI do not even\
    \ remember them), knowledge, wisdom, love, and faith in God. \nThanks to the University\
    \ of Valladolid for being the house where the \nknowledge and creativity expressed\
    \ in the past few years. Thanks to the directors of \nthis work, Luis Manuel Navas\
    \ and Luis Hernández for the guide and support to \naccomplish this thesis. Tanks\
    \ to Matilde and Oscar for the support in the last months \nfor the writing of\
    \ the thesis. \nThanks to all the friends who were the closest during the stay\
    \ in this \nstrange but familiar country of what is known as the old continent.\
    \ Thanks to Anais, \nMª. Ángeles, Charo, Ángela R., Alberto, Carmen, Bea, Laura,\

    \ Alfredo, Jorge and Mario. \nA special acknowledgment for whose were not just\
    \ good friends but also \nterrific teachers in these years: Jorge, Gonzalo, Víctor\
    \ and Michel. Once again, it was \nshown that the humblest people are always the\
    \ ones whose more good things have \nto share with you. Thanks for being on the\
    \ train in which we shared fragments of \nthe trip but had different arrival stations.\
    \ \nvi \n \nFor all the people in Spain, maybe I am wrong with this but, a song\
    \ from \nThe Beatles comes into my head when I think about all this ― the lyrics\
    \ sing “… you \nand I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead…”.\

    \ \n \nABSTRACT \n \nxxv \nAbstract \nAgriculture is an essential human activity,\
    \ highly dependent on \nmeteorological conditions and focus of research and innovation\
    \ to afront several \nchallenges. Climate change, global warming, and the degradation\
    \ of agricultural \necosystems are just a few of the problems that humans are\
    \ facing for continuing the \nessential food production. Seeking the innovation\
    \ in the agricultural sector, three \nmain research topics were considered for\
    \ this thesis; such as microalgae production, \nsoil color and fertility, and\
    \ meteorological data acquisition. \nThese subjects have increasing roles in agriculture,\
    \ specifically under the \nuncertainty in the future of food production. Microalgae\
    \ are a healthy alternative \nfor crops fertilization and soil sustainability;\
    \ while the soil fertility parameters need \nto be more studied to aim lower cost\
    \ and faster analysis methods to help the \nmanagement. Agriculture, as a highly\
    \ weather-dependent activity, needs \nmeteorological data to anticipate events,\
    \ planning, and management crops in an \nefficient mode. These topics were selected\
    \ with the purpose to improve the current \nstate of the art, propose new alternatives\
    \ based, mainly, in the application of \nartificial neural networks (ANNs) as\
    \ a novel manner to solve the problems and \ngenerate knowledge of direct application\
    \ in crop systems. ANNs are a useful tool to \nmodeling and solve complex nonlinear\
    \ problems; they are a mathematical model of \nthe animal brain and their ability\
    \ to deal with complicated issues drive the scientific \ncommunity to used them\
    \ to find solutions hardly found with other techniques. \nThe main objective of\
    \ this thesis was to generate ANN models capable of \naddressing agricultural\
    \ related problems as an alternative to traditional and more \nexpensive methods\
    \ for management, analysis, and data acquisition in the crop \nsystems. For the\
    \ microalgae culture experiments, monoalgal and mixed algal culture \nspectral\
    \ signatures from light absorption measurements were analyzed. \nAdditionally,\
    \ an ANN was used alongside the spectral signature in order to create a \nmodel\
    \ capable of classifying the microalgae cultures and determine the species \n\
    present in suspension. The results show that the ANN was capable of distinguishing\
    \ \nbetween monoalgal and mixed algal cultures, identifying the microalgae species\
    \ in \nthe monoalgal cultures and providing the approximate composition of mixed\
    \ algal \ncultures.  \nRegarding the soil study, soil samples were classified\
    \ according to the \nMunsell color notation, and the obtained hues were used to\
    \ group soils and perform \nstatistical analysis over their fertility attributes.\
    \ In addition, RGB and L*a*b* colors \nxxvi \n \nwere used as input in ANNs to\
    \ create models to describe the soil fertility parameters. \nThe RGB and the L*a*b*\
    \ colors were obtained from digital color photographs and \ncomputer software\
    \ programmed to perform quick and accurate measurements. The \nresults showed\
    \ that the soil aggrupation based on the Munsell color hue resulted \nnot efficient\
    \ to separate samples according to fertility levels and to regard the ANNs \n\
    approach to describe soils, the obtained models were not capable of providing\
    \ \naccurate results. \nFinally, for the meteorological data acquisition study,\
    \ daily data from a \nweather station network were used to perform interpolations\
    \ with several methods, \nincluding traditional techniques and ANNs, and the results\
    \ were evaluated to \ncompare the accuracy of the methods. With these interpolations\
    \ algorithms, the \ndevelopment of virtual weather stations (VWS) was proposed.\
    \ A script code to \nautomatically acquire, process and interpolate meteorological\
    \ data was made to \nperform the estimations in different locations where weather\
    \ stations are not \navailable. The results showed that the interpolation methods\
    \ have high accuracies \n― decreasing slightly during summer and winter. From\
    \ a practical perspective, the \nmethods here described could be useful to produce\
    \ meteorological time series data \nwith the VWS. \nIn conclusion, ANNs have proved\
    \ to be a powerful tool to solve \nclassifications, estimations and predictions\
    \ problems. The use of ANN in agricultural \nrelated issues is a critical step\
    \ to find solutions for problems and help the workers \nto make faster and better\
    \ decisions in the productive chain. For instance, in \nmicroalgae commercial\
    \ production, the development method would provide a fast \nand reliable tool\
    \ for managing. In soil fertility, ANNs still have a road to follow to find \n\
    accurate models; this research gave light for new directions to take in this matter.\
    \ \nMoreover, regarding the meteorological data acquisition, the VWS can help\
    \ farmers \nto obtain data of importance for cultures and to plan more efficient\
    \ irrigations. \n \n \nxxvii \nResumen \nLa agricultura es una actividad esencial\
    \ para los humanos, es altamente \ndependiente de las condiciones meteorológicas\
    \ y foco de investigación e innovación \ncon el objetivo de enfrentar diversos\
    \ desafíos. El cambio climático, calentamiento \nglobal y la degradación de los\
    \ ecosistemas agrícolas son sólo algunos de los \nproblemas que los humanos enfrentamos\
    \ para continuar con la esencial producción \nde alimentos. Buscando la innovación\
    \ en el sector agrícola, se consideraron tres \ntópicos principales de investigación\
    \ para esta tesis; la producción de microalgas, el \ncolor del suelo y la fertilidad,\
    \ y la adquisición de datos meteorológicos. \nEstos temas tienen roles cada vez\
    \ más importantes en la agricultura, \nespecialmente bajo la incertidumbre del\
    \ futuro de la producción de alimentos. Las \nmicroalgas son una interesante alternativa\
    \ para la fertilización de cultivos y la \nsostenibilidad del suelo; mientras\
    \ que los parámetros de fertilidad del suelo \nnecesitan ser más estudiados para\
    \ desarrollar métodos de análisis de menor costo \ny más rápidos para ayudar al\
    \ manejo. La agricultura, como actividad altamente \ndependiente del clima, necesita\
    \ de datos meteorológicos para anticipar eventos, \nplanificar y manejar los cultivos\
    \ eficientemente. Estos temas se seleccionaron con el \npropósito de mejorar el\
    \ estado actual de la técnica, proponer nuevas alternativas \nbasadas, principalmente,\
    \ en la aplicación de redes neuronales artificiales (ANN) \ncomo una manera novedosa\
    \ de resolver los problemas y generar conocimiento de \naplicación directa en\
    \ sistemas de cultivos. Las ANNs son una herramienta útil para \nmodelar y resolver\
    \ problemas complejos no lineales; son un modelo matemático del \ncerebro de los\
    \ animales y su capacidad para tratar problemas complicados lleva a la \ncomunidad\
    \ científica a usarlas para encontrar soluciones que difícilmente otras \ntécnicas\
    \ pueden resolver. \nEl objetivo principal de esta tesis fue generar modelos de\
    \ ANNs capaces de \nabordar problemas relacionados con la agricultura, como una\
    \ alternativa a los \nmétodos tradicionales y más costosos empleados en el manejo,\
    \ análisis y \nadquisición de datos en los sistemas agrarios. Para los experimentos\
    \ con cultivos de \nmicroalgas, se analizaron las huellas espectrales provenientes\
    \ mediciones de la \nabsorción de luz de suspensiones monoalgales y cultivos mixtos.\
    \ Además, se utilizó \nuna ANN junto con las huellas espectrales para crear un\
    \ modelo capaz de clasificar \nlos cultivos de microalgas y determinar las especies\
    \ presentes en suspensión. Los \nresultados muestran que la ANN fue capaz de distinguir\
    \ entre cultivos monoalgales \nxxviii \n \ny mixtos, identificando las especies\
    \ de microalgas en los cultivos de monoalgales y \nproporcionando una composición\
    \ aproximada en los cultivos mixtos. \nCon respecto al estudio del suelo, muestras\
    \ de suelo se clasificaron según \nla notación de color Munsell y los tonos obtenidos\
    \ se utilizaron para agrupar los \nsuelos y realizar análisis estadísticos sobre\
    \ sus atributos de fertilidad. Además, los \ncolores RGB y L*a*b* se utilizaron\
    \ como entrada en ANNs para crear modelos que \ndescriban los parámetros de fertilidad\
    \ del suelo. Los colores RGB y L*a*b* se \nobtuvieron a partir de fotografías\
    \ digitales a color y una aplicación informática \nprogramada para realizar mediciones\
    \ rápidas y precisas. Los resultados mostraron \nque la agrupación de suelos basada\
    \ en el tono del color de Munsell no resultó \neficiente para separar las muestras\
    \ según niveles de fertilidad y respecto al enfoque \nde las ANNs para describir\
    \ los suelos, los modelos obtenidos no fueron capaces de \nproporcionar resultados\
    \ precisos. \nFinalmente, para el estudio de adquisición de datos meteorológicos,\
    \ los \ndatos diarios de una red de estaciones meteorológicas se utilizaron para\
    \ realizar \ninterpolaciones con varios métodos, incluidas las técnicas tradicionales\
    \ y ANNs, y los \nresultados fueron evaluaron para comparar la precisión de los\
    \ métodos. Con estos \nalgoritmos de interpolación, se propuso el desarrollo de\
    \ estaciones meteorológicas \nvirtuales (VWS). Se programó un código para adquirir,\
    \ procesar e interpolar \nautomáticamente datos meteorológicos para realizar estimaciones\
    \ en diferentes \nlugares sin disponibilidad de estaciones meteorológicas. Los\
    \ resultados mostraron \nque los métodos de interpolación tienen altas precisiones\
    \ ― estas disminuyen \nligeramente durante el verano y el invierno. Desde una\
    \ perspectiva práctica, los \nmétodos aquí descritos podrían ser útiles para producir\
    \ series de datos \nmeteorológicos con las VWS. \nEn conclusión, las ANNs han\
    \ demostrado ser una herramienta poderosa \npara resolver problemas de clasificación,\
    \ estimación y predicción. El uso de ANNs en \ntemas relacionados con la agricultura\
    \ es un paso crítico para encontrar soluciones a \nlos problemas y ayudar a los\
    \ productores a tomar decisiones más rápidas y mejores \ndurante los procesos\
    \ productivos. Por ejemplo, en la producción comercial de \nmicroalgas, el método\
    \ desarrollado proporcionaría una herramienta rápida y \nconfiable para la gestión.\
    \ En la fertilidad del suelo, las ANNs aún tienen un camino \nque seguir para\
    \ encontrar modelos precisos; esta investigación dio luz a nuevas \ndirecciones\
    \ a tomar en este asunto. Y con respecto a la adquisición de datos \nmeteorológicos,\
    \ las VWS pueden ayudar a los agricultores a obtener datos de \nimportancia para\
    \ los cultivos y para planificar un riego más eficiente. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n\
    \ \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) have\
    \ emerged in the last decades as a \nwide area of new opportunities for academic\
    \ research and applications in many \nfields such as remote sensing, image classification,\
    \ speech recognition, economics, \nrobotics, automotive engineering, web-informatics,\
    \ bio-informatics, intelligent \nmedical diagnosing and treatment and so on. All\
    \ these applications aim to solve \nplenty of real-world problems employing the\
    \ ANNs high capacity to find solutions to \nnon-linear and complex problems (Cheng\
    \ et al., 2018; Kakuda et al., 2019; Li et al., \n2018). ANNs create new chances\
    \ for traditional issues and new technologies related \nmatters by giving new\
    \ approaches to improve techniques and model accuracies \nthrough the capacity\
    \ of ANNs of mapping input variables with a given target value, \nthis ability\
    \ has been used in several studies to make predictions, classifications and \n\
    estimations with higher precisions in comparison with traditional techniques \n\
    (Abrishami et al., 2018; Alanis, 2018; Amrouche and Le Pivert, 2014; Tealab et\
    \ al., \n2017; Tkáč and Verner, 2016). \nThe present work is a compendium of research\
    \ in agricultural related \nissues applying ANNs to solve problems. Therefore,\
    \ three main research topics were \nconsidered, such as microalgae production,\
    \ soil color and fertility, and \nmeteorological data. These represent essential\
    \ roles in crops system, specifically in \nthe future of food production, global\
    \ warming, and sustainability. Microalgae are a \nhealthy alternative for crops\
    \ fertilization and soil fertility sustainability, while the \nsoil fertility\
    \ parameters need to be more studied to aim lower cost and faster \nanalysis methods\
    \ to help the management. Last but not least, agriculture is a highly \nweather-dependent\
    \ activity and needs meteorological data to anticipate events, \nplanning and\
    \ management crops in an efficient mode. \nThese topics were selected with the\
    \ purpose to improve the current state \nof the art, propose new alternatives\
    \ based, mainly, in the application of ANNs as a \nnovel manner to solve the problems\
    \ and generate knowledge of direct application \nin crop systems. In the following\
    \ sections, the research problems and the hypothesis \n(section 1.1), objectives\
    \ (section 1.2) and a summary of the methodology used \n(section 1.3) on this\
    \ thesis will be detailed. Furthermore, the motivation (section \n1.4) and innovative\
    \ aspect (section 1.5) of this research, and an overview of the \nthesis structure\
    \ (section 1.6) are also presented in this chapter. \n \n4 \n \n \n \n1.1 Research\
    \ problems and hypothesis \nThe research topics, as mentioned earlier, microalgae\
    \ production, soil \ncolor and fertility, and meteorological data are a niche\
    \ for innovation, as other fields \nin the agricultural sector. This innovation\
    \ is a crucial concern due to the fact of the \nchallenges for the agricultural\
    \ sector in the present and future scenarios. \nConsidering this, ANNs were applied\
    \ in this research to solve issues in the \nterritory of these topics; in the\
    \ microalgae assessment, the issue was to develop a \nfast and reliable method\
    \ to analyze microalgae cultures; in the soil color and fertility \nstudy, the\
    \ issue was to relate color and fertility in order to find relationships \nbetween\
    \ both. Lastly, in the meteorological data assessment, the matter was to \ngenerate\
    \ a method for data acquisition in locations with no availability of weather \n\
    stations. \nIn this thesis, the hypothesis formulated for the research topics\
    \ were: \n- Microalgae light absorbance analysis through ANNs can elucidate the\
    \ \nbiological culture composition and be used as an alternative for the \nassessment\
    \ of microalgae cultures. \n- Soil color analysis can provide information about\
    \ fertility parameters, and \nANNs can be applied to map this relationship and\
    \ conceive a model for \nrapid soil evaluation. \n- Meteorological data acquisition\
    \ can be performed by using interpolation \ntechniques and ANNs, alongside real\
    \ data from weather stations to \ninterpolate values with high accuracy. \n \n\
    1.2 Objectives \n1.2.1 General objective \nThe general objective of the research\
    \ is to generate ANN models capable \nof addressing agricultural related problems\
    \ as an alternative to traditional and more \nexpensive methods for management,\
    \ analysis, and data acquisition in the crop \nsystems. \n \nIntroduction \n \n\
    5 \n \n \n \n1.2.2 Specific objectives  \nThe specific objectives were separated\
    \ for each of the main research topics \nof the thesis. The established objectives\
    \ are presented below. \n \nIn the microalgae culture study:  \n- Study light\
    \ absorption spectra of the different microalgae species. \n- Evaluate the ability\
    \ of ANN to differentiate between monoalgal and \nmixed algal cultures. \n- Determine\
    \ the feasibility of using ANN to estimate the biological \ncomposition of mixed\
    \ microalgae cultures. \n \nRegarding the soil color and fertility study:  \n\
    - Analyze soil color in order to determinate its capability to group soils \n\
    according to fertility levels. \n- Develop a computer tool for soil color measurement\
    \ and classification. \n- Describe soils fertility parameters using color analysis\
    \ through ANNs. \n \nConcerning the meteorological data acquisition study:  \n\
    - Evaluate and compare the accuracy of several interpolation algorithms \n― including\
    \ the traditionally used and ANNs. \n- Study the seasons and the extreme phenomena\
    \ effects in the \nperformance of interpolation methods. \n- Devise a set of algorithms\
    \ to acquire real meteorological data, process \nthem, and generate accurate estimations\
    \ in distinct locations, \neconomically and straightforwardly. \n \n6 \n \n \n\
    \ \n1.3 Methodology overview \nTo conduct the experimental phase of the thesis,\
    \ three experiments were \ncarried out. For the microalgae experience, monoalgal\
    \ and mixed algal culture \nspectral signatures from light absorption measurements\
    \ were analyzed. \nAdditionally, an ANN was used alongside the spectral signature\
    \ in order to create a \nmodel capable of classifying the microalgae cultures\
    \ and determine the species \npresent in suspension. \nFor the soil study, soil\
    \ samples were classified according to the Munsell \ncolor notation, and the obtained\
    \ hues were used to group soils and perform \nstatistical analysis over the fertility\
    \ parameters. In addition, RGB and L*a*b* colors \nwere used as input in ANNs\
    \ to create models to describe the soil fertility parameters. \nThe RGB and the\
    \ L*a*b* colors were obtained from digital color photographs and \ncomputer software\
    \ programmed to perform quick and accurate measurements. \nFinally, for the meteorological\
    \ data acquisition study, daily data from a \nweather station network were used\
    \ to perform interpolations with several methods, \nincluding ANNs and traditional\
    \ techniques. With these interpolations algorithms, \nthe development of virtual\
    \ weather stations (VWS) was proposed, scripts \nautomatically acquire, and process\
    \ meteorological data were coded, and afterward, \nperform estimations in different\
    \ locations without weather stations availability. \n \n1.4 Motivation for the\
    \ research \nANNs studies are nowadays a multidisciplinary science, a crucial\
    \ factor for \nthat is their application to solving problems in different areas,\
    \ pursuing the \nmodernization of techniques, better prediction of phenomena,\
    \ classification, and \nestimation of everyday and important matters. The room\
    \ for applications of ANN \nare infinitely potential, and the scope of this tool\
    \ is changing the manner scientific \nprocess data and conduct experiments. \n\
    The agriculture is a niche for infinite research since with new days, new \nproblems\
    \ and challenges appear and need solutions, and at the same time, better \nsolutions\
    \ for older problems are also needed. With the aim of solving agricultural \n\
    related subjects, this research was motivated and focused on microalgae culture\
    \ \nanalysis, soil color and fertility studies and meteorological data acquisition\
    \ through \ninterpolation methods. \nIntroduction \n \n7 \n \n \n \nMicroalgae\
    \ are an interesting group of microorganisms, and their \ncultivation is a promising\
    \ tool for carbon sequestration and biomass utilization, for \nexample, as an\
    \ organic soil amendment ― therefore their agricultural and \nenvironmental importance\
    \ will arise in the next few years. Regarding soil fertility, \nthis parameter\
    \ is one of the most important in the production ecosystem, and its \nknowledge\
    \ is vital for the correct and sustainable management of soils. Concerning \n\
    the meteorological data, agriculture as an activity that is highly dependent on\
    \ the \nweather requires the availability of these type of data can be useful\
    \ for improving, \nfor instance, the irrigation calculus and planning, crop phenology,\
    \ pest studies and \nmodeling, among other aspects. \n \n1.5 Innovative aspects\
    \ of the research \nThis thesis was designed with the practical application of\
    \ technologies and \ntechniques in mind, to solve specific problems in agricultural\
    \ disciplines. The \ninnovative aspects and contributions of this research are\
    \ methodologies and tools \nthat can be used directly in culture systems, been\
    \ microalgae or conventional crops. \nThe main contributions are cited below:\
    \ \n- An ANN to elucidate microalgae species in suspensions was made. The \nmodel\
    \ provides a fast and powerful tool for microalgae culture \nmanagement at the\
    \ commercial scale, provides information regarding \nthe biological composition\
    \ of cultures, and approximates the relative \nproportions of species in the suspensions.\
    \ The developed method means \na cheaper and faster analysis method in comparison\
    \ with the typically \nused. \n- A scientific paper with the title “Monoalgal\
    \ and mixed algal cultures \ndiscrimination by using an artificial neural network”\
    \ (Appendix A) was \npublished in the “Algal Research” journal. A Q1 journal in\
    \ Biotechnology \nand applied microbiology journal with an impact factor of 3.75.\
    \ \n- The development of computer software, the DigiCIELAB, which is a \npowerful\
    \ tool to perform the color measurement in a faster and more \naffordable manner\
    \ in comparison with traditional colorimeters. The \nsoftware was selected by\
    \ the University of Valladolid in the “Prometeo” \n2017 program and intellectually\
    \ protected as a result of this selection \n(Appendix B). \n8 \n \n \n \n- The\
    \ development of the VWS algorithms to acquire and process \nmeteorological data\
    \ from weather station networks with the ultimate \npurpose of estimate data where\
    \ no weather station is available. The \nVWS is a feasible alternative for the\
    \ acquisition of meteorological data \nof importance for agricultural activities.\

    \ in each one of these topics \n― is presented in Chapter 2. \nThe materials used\
    \ and the methodology applied in the experimental \nphase for the microalgae,\
    \ soil color, and meteorological data studies are detailed in \nChapter 3. The\

    \ literature to contrast the obtained results are presented, separately by \n\
    research topic, in Chapter 4. The conclusion, the general from the overall research\
    \ \nexperience and the specifics regarding each topic, are illustrated in Chapter\
    \ 5. \nFinally, the cited bibliography is referenced (Chapter 7), and the additional\

    \ \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n \n2. Theoretical Background \nIn this chapter, the theoretical\
    \ background that supports the thesis \ndevelopment will be presented, including\
    \ the basic concepts for the methodology \napplied to seek the research objectives.\
    \ This section will describe a brief agriculture \npanorama, future challenges\
    \ and possible manners to address the issues with \ntechnologies and alternative\
    \ agricultural practices (section 2.1); the microalgae \nproduction and its agriculture\
    \ importance (section 2.2), soil fertility and color \nanalysis (section 2.3)\
    \ and meteorological data for agriculture (section 2.4) are \ntreated as well.\
    \ Finally, an overview of ANNs, concepts, modeling and training \nprocess, and\
    \ applications of this technique (section 2.5). \n \n2.1 Challenges in agriculture\
    \ and new technologies \nAchieving maximum crop yield at minimum cost is one of\
    \ the goals of \nagricultural production from an economic point of view. However,\
    \ since 1950, a \nclimatological transformation is taking place as a consequence\
    \ of several \nphenomena like deforestation, the emissions of greenhouse gases\
    \ (GHG) increment, \nozone loss, the increment of global temperature, change in\
    \ precipitations regimes \nand other climate change effects, with a higher acceleration\
    \ from the 90s (Smith et \nal., 2014; Steffen et al., 2015). These transformations,\
    \ specifically regarding the \nanthropogenic climate change, are considered as\
    \ one of the most significant \nenvironmental, social and economic threats to\
    \ the future world (Ghosh et al., 2019) \nand agriculture is one of the most exposed\
    \ to climatic impacts (Martins et al., 2019; \nTran et al., 2019). \nGlobal food\
    \ demand is expected to increase considerably in the near \nfuture as a result\
    \ of the growing population. Agricultural research needs to step up \nto meet\
    \ a more sustainable development for food production, human nutrition, \nclimate\
    \ change and environmental protection in a world with 9.7 billion people by \n\
    2050 (Thornton et al., 2018). Considering that, with the modernization of \nagriculture,\
    \ high inputs of fertilizers, pesticides, and mechanical energy are \ndemanded\
    \ for labors (Erb et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2017), GHG emissions such as \ncarbon\
    \ dioxide (CO2) (Li et al., 2019), nitrous oxide (NO2) which is one of the most\
    \ \nharmful GHG (Liu et al., 2019; Rowlings et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2017)\
    \ and others \n12 \n \n \n \nsuch as methane (CH4), nitrate (NO3-), ammonia (NH3)\
    \ will increase (Sanz-Cobena et \nal., 2017a). \nIt is estimated that agriculture\
    \ contributes 11% to the anthropogenic GHG \nemissions, approximately 5.3 Gt CO2\
    \ equivalents in 2010 (Figure 1), the trend \nindicates that it will increase\
    \ 9% in 2030 and 18% in 2050 with respect to 2010, or \nup to 37% more considering\
    \ the 90s as base reference (Tubiello et al., 2014). \n \nFigure 1. CO2 emissions\
    \ estimations for the 1990s, 2000s and 2010 and projections \nfor 2030 and 2050\
    \ for agricultural related activities (elaborate from data of Tubiello \net al.,\
    \ 2014). \n \nClimate change is a danger for crops and food production (Fitzgerald\
    \ et al., \n2019; Manners and van Etten, 2018) and risk for smallholder farmers\
    \ and livestock \nsector, particularly in dryland regions  (Hansen et al., 2019;\
    \ Herrero et al., 2015). \nGlobally, annual climate variability accounts for roughly\
    \ a third (32–39%) of the \nobserved crop yield variability (Ray et al., 2015);\
    \ increasing the yield losses in \nwarmer years; it is estimated that for each\
    \ degree Celsius (⁰C) of mean global \ntemperature, there is a reduction in global\
    \ wheat grain production of about 6% \n(Asseng et al., 2015). \nMinimizing and\
    \ preventing environmental degradation is a critical \nsustainability challenge\
    \ of the present and coming decades (Bais-Moleman et al., \n4.6\n5.0\n5.3\n5.8\n\
    6.3\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\n7.0\n1990s\n2000s\n2010\n2030\n2050\n\
    (in Gt CO2) \nEmissions of CO2 equivalent from agricultural related activities\n\
    Theoretical Background \n \n13 \n \n \n \n2019). Climate-smart agriculture (CSA)\
    \ is widely promoted as an approach for \nreorienting agricultural development\
    \ under the realities of climate change (Figure \n2), seeks to meet three challenges:\
    \ improve the adaptation capacity of farming \nsystems to climate change, reduce\
    \ the greenhouse gas emissions of these systems, \nand enhance agricultural productivity\
    \ (Acosta-Alba et al., 2019; Jagustović et al., \n2019; Thornton et al., 2018).\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. Climate-smart agriculture foundations for the development of\
    \ sustainable \nagriculture. \n \nA key reason for the emergence of the CSA concept\
    \ is the recognition that \nagriculture, and related food security issues, require\
    \ a synthesized approach which \nmay not be achieved by tackling climate mitigation\
    \ and adaptation objectives \nseparately (Long et al., 2016). CSA is the combined\
    \ strategies to respond to the \nchallenges of making food security, providing\
    \ public goods and ecosystem services \nto society (Bais-Moleman et al., 2019).\

    Some strategies to achieve the CSA objectives regarding enhance \nagricultural\
    \ productivity (A); promote adaptation (B); and, reduce GHG emissions (C) \nare\
    \ described below: \n \nA. Enhance agricultural productivity \nThe agricultural\
    \ force labor has globally declined from the 19th century \nfrom 75% of the total\
    \ population to levels underneath the 5% in the current \nCentury (Tomich et al.,\
    \ 2019). Less agriculturist produced food for more people; \nthis was possible\
    \ using the technological improvements in the sector. However, \nthe unsustainability\
    \ of agricultural ecosystems under the current techniques \nhave created the need\
    \ for actions to not only to increase the production but \nrather to maintain\
    \ or recovery degraded fields (Ahmad et al., 2017). \nOn the one hand, the progressive\
    \ substitution of mineral fertilizers for \norganic fertilizers can improve soil\
    \ fertility and recover poor soils (Sanz-Cobena \net al., 2017b; Zhang et al.,\
    \ 2019). On the other hand, practices such as no-till of \nlands significantly\
    \ increased yields and improved soil quality, also shifting the \nmicrobial community\
    \ and activity associated with an increase in organic matter, \ncarbon, nitrogen\
    \ and phosphorus cycling (Mbuthia et al., 2015). Understanding \nof trade-offs\
    \ over temporal and spatial scales between the instantaneous short-\nterm gain,\
    \ such as incomes, and the long-term negative impact, such as reduction \nof crop\
    \ yields, is a crucial factor to incentivize agriculturist to adopt new \ntechniques\
    \ (Jagustović et al., 2019). \nIn terms of alternatives for chemical fertilizers,\
    \ microalgae have been \nconsidered potential producers of organic fertilizers\
    \ for many decades and their \npotential is still under scope and development\
    \ today (Benemann, 1979; Morales-\nAmaral et al., 2015). Microalgae are photosynthetic\
    \ microorganism adapted into \nseveral aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Dashkova\
    \ et al., 2016; Feng et al., \n2016) and with a strong presence in agricultural\
    \ fields (Morowvat and Ghasemi, \n2016). \nRecent research activities have demonstrated\
    \ that microalgae extracts \nhave a stimulation effect when used as a foliar product\
    \ on wheat (Shah et al., \n2013) and maize (Zermeño-González et al., 2015). In\
    \ the same way, the \napplication of microalgae on wheat seeds at the time of\
    \ sowing provides benefits \nfor the plant and crop development. The causes can\
    \ be related to the generation \nof phytohormones such as indoleacetic acid (Hussain\
    \ and Hasnain, 2011; Jäger et \nTheoretical Background \n \n15 \n \n \n \nal.,\
    \ 2005; Swarnalakshmi et al., 2013) or the activity of nitrogenase, which \nincreases\
    \ the binding of atmospheric N2 (Abd-Alla et al., 1994). In the current \nmarket,\
    \ microalgae extracts are available in compounds for organic farming \nlabeled\
    \ as bio-stimulators. \nMicroalgae biomass application in soils is beneficial\
    \ for crops and yields \n(Shaaban, 2001), the organic matter, carbon content and\
    \ biological activity in \nsoils increase with these microorganisms (Castro et\
    \ al., 2017; Miralles et al., \n2012; Xie et al., 2007). Microalgae, specifically\
    \ when they are obtained from \nwastewater treatments (De-Bashan and Bashan, 2004),\
    \ contains several \nnutrients removed from the treated sewage. The recycling\
    \ of nutrients by \nmicroalgae is a matter that has been more studied recently\
    \ and tested in \nagricultural applications (Egle et al., 2016; Mukherjee et al.,\
    \ 2015). \n \nB. Promote adaptation \nAugmenting climate resiliency of agricultural\
    \ systems with improved \nvarieties of cultivars is one of the most suitable action\
    \ to adapt agriculture for \nfuture scenarios (Dey et al., 2019). Adaptation to\
    \ climate change is necessary to \nensure food security and protect the livelihoods\
    \ of farmers (Sapkota et al., 2019). \nHowever, assigning a label of “climate\
    \ adaptation” to any promising innovation \nin agriculture is a common flaw. Many\
    \ of these crop varieties do not always arise \nin minimaxing the climate change\
    \ impacts, other than maximizing the profits for \na given technology (Lobell,\
    \ 2014). \nThe major global studies are focused in different adaptation strategies\
    \ \nsuch as changes in planting dates, dynamic irrigation, nutrient management\
    \ or \ntheir combination and also included carbon fertilization effects (Aggarwal\
    \ et al., \n2019). Other adaptation strategies include the calendar days of a\
    \ crop and the \ngrowing degree days, cultivars with more extended growth periods\
    \ and higher \nthermal requirements could partially mitigate the adverse effects\
    \ of global \nwarming (Martins et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2014). \nAdopting other\
    \ productive practices and technologies, such as more \norganic farming, can be\
    \ a powerful mechanism for reducing farm vulnerability \n(Bouttes et al., 2019).\
    \ The adoption of alternative techniques requires \ninterdisciplinary efforts\
    \ to identify real options (Bommarco et al., 2012). For \ninstance, more information\
    \ is required for better irrigation management and \ncrop calendar planning. This\
    \ information includes meteorological data for the \n16 \n \n \n \nestimation\
    \ of water requirements (Allen et al., 1998) or taking actions to prevent \nextreme\
    \ temperatures damage, stress, yield loses, germination problems, pest \nand disease\
    \ affections (Johkan et al., 2011; Pearce, 2001). \n \nC. GHG emission reductions\
    \ \nReducing GHG emissions is a cross effort in distinct areas. New \ntechnologies\
    \ are consigned to study GHG causes, increasing the efficiency of \nmachinery\
    \ and proposing alternative practices are conventional approaches \nnowadays (Echevarria\
    \ and Xiu, 2014; Nejat et al., 2015). \nCarbon sequestration in agricultural soils\
    \ is an exciting alternative against \nGHG (Poeplau and Don, 2015). Increasing\
    \ soil organic carbon (SOC) to store CO2 \namounts into grounds that otherwise\
    \ will reach the atmosphere (Meyer et al., \n2018), also reduces external inputs\
    \ in terms of fertilizers and makes a better \nscenario for crops under variable\
    \ and extreme climate conditions (Pittelkow et \nal., 2015). The changes in SOC\
    \ stocks are a result of the carbon inputs, mainly in \nthe form of dead plant\
    \ material or manure and outputs, mainly caused by \ndecomposition, leaching,\
    \ and erosion (Poeplau and Don, 2015). \nTillage is a significant contributor\
    \ to energy consumption and carbon \nemissary in the sector. Different management\
    \ practices such as non-tillage, \nrotations and cover crops can mitigate GHG\
    \ emissions, especially the ones \nrelated to CO2 and NO2 from savings in fuel\
    \ and nitrogen volatility (Bais-Moleman \net al., 2019; Pratibha et al., 2019;\
    \ Sanz-Cobena et al., 2017b). Non-tillage \ncontributes to organic matter (OM)\
    \ accumulation, increasing the soil water \nretention capacity, biological activity,\
    \ increase the efficiency of fertilization and \nreduces its use (Rusco et al.,\
    \ 2001; Sanz-Cobena et al., 2017b). At the same time, \nno-till produced the highest\
    \ revenues, despite having higher initial and \nproduction costs than conventional\
    \ systems, but the overall balance is positive \nin favor of non-tillage systems\
    \ (Hansen et al., 2019; TerAvest et al., 2019). \nThere is an increasing concern\
    \ about the negative impacts associated with \nthe release of reactive nitrogen\
    \ from fertilizers (Recio et al., 2018). N-source \nchemical fertilizers are the\
    \ main source of NO2 GHG in agriculture (Wolff et al., \n2017). Replacing a part\
    \ of chemical N fertilizer is an excellent strategy to mitigate \nthe negative\
    \ impacts (Jat et al., 2019). However, there are still several limitations \n\
    in the economic and source of alternative fertilizers (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\
    Evidently, chemical fertilization cannot and should not be totally removed from\
    \ \nTheoretical Background \n \n17 \n \n \n \ncrop management tasks, instead,\
    \ better fertilization programs have been \ncarefully elaborated since the efficiency\
    \ of fertilization is a critical issue to reduce \nenvironmental impacts of agricultural\
    \ activities and ensure food production \n(Recio et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015).\
    \ Variable application rates of nitrogen \nachieve lower expenses on supplies,\
    \ higher profits and reduce nitrate leaching \n(Basso et al., 2016); better timing\
    \ for applications (Rowlings et al., 2013) or \nfertigation with nitrate-based\
    \ fertilizers (Abalos et al., 2014) are others \nalternatives for a more efficient\
    \ use of nitrogen fertilizers and address the \nchallenges of environmental degradation\
    \ and climate change. \n \nCSA priorities encompass the adaptation of agricultural\
    \ activities to the \nclimate change for the 1.5 future while reducing the impact\
    \ on the environment. \nThe 1.5 scenario is the estimation where the mean global\
    \ temperature will increase \nby 1.5 ⁰C (Martinez-Baron et al., 2018). As a summary,\
    \ farmers adopt practices and \ntechnologies such as improved varieties, planting\
    \ at optimal times, and enhanced \nwater and fertilizer management (Aggarwal et\
    \ al., 2019) and researchers have to \ndevelop, test and validate those techniques\
    \ to drive present and future situations. \nThere are a bunch of promising technology\
    \ innovations; for instance, \nnanotechnology has proven to improve seed plant\
    \ germination, growth, yields, and \nquality of the harvest. In post-harvest,\
    \ nanotechnology increases the storage period \nfor vegetables and fruits (Huang\
    \ et al., 2015; Prasad et al., 2017). Information and \ncommunication technologies,\
    \ as agro-advisory services, could be highly useful for \ndecision making. However,\
    \ to achieve this objective, more rigorous information is \nneeded, and this warrants\
    \ further work for researchers (Westermann et al., 2018). \nThe implementation\
    \ of these tools at various scales and cases and the amount and \nquality of the\
    \ information needed for making decisions and extract conclusions \npropose a\
    \ big challenge for this approach (Thornton et al., 2018). \nRegarding technologies\
    \ that contribute to achieving CSA challenges, novel \ntechniques to analyze data,\
    \ solving problems, create models, and predict high-\nquality datasets can be\
    \ useful to face CSA objectives. In these terms, artificial neural \nnetworks\
    \ (ANNs) are a promising tool for analyzing data and solve complex and \nnonlinear\
    \ problems, with several potential application in the agricultural sector. \n\
    ANNs are mathematical models that were developed from studying how the animal\
    \ \nbrain works. They consist of interconnected units called artificial neurons,\
    \ which \nhave adaptive parameters that can be used for learning, classifications,\
    \ and \npredictions (Olatunji and Arif, 2016). \n18 \n \n \n \nANNs adoption to\
    \ solve diverse kinds of problems have been taken \nenormous attention in the\
    \ last two decades (Tkáč and Verner, 2016). ANNs can be \nused for classifications\
    \ problems, approximation functions, image analysis, patterns \nanalysis, and\
    \ others (Zurada, 1992). To mention some examples, ANNs are capable \nof estimating\
    \ the status of rotary elements of agricultural machinery by processing \nthe\
    \ signal from accelerometers without other variable analysis (Martínez-Martínez\
    \ \net al., 2015). \nCrop yields predictions based on soil fertility parameters\
    \ and metrological \ndata was possible by using ANNs, thanks to its abstraction\
    \ capability (Dahikar and \nRode, 2014). In plant diseases, an ANN was able to\
    \ estimate the severity of angular \nleaf spot in bean cultures, using leaf and\
    \ canopy hyperspectral reflectance spectra \n(Martínez-Martínez et al., 2018).\
    \ The use of ANNs have a widespread future in the \ndevelopment of new techniques,\
    \ and there is more room for future research and \napplications of ANNs (Darji\
    \ et al., 2015; Ghanbarzadeh et al., 2009; Laaboudi et al., \n2012). \n \n \n\
    \ \nTheoretical Background \n \n19 \n \n \n \n2.2 Microalgae culture \nMicroalgae\
    \ include prokaryotic and eukaryotic microscopic unicellular and \nmulticellular\
    \ photosynthetic organisms (Soni et al., 2017). These organisms are a \npromising\
    \ tool to fight climate change by capturing CO2 (Bai et al., 2017) and also in\
    \ \nagriculture as fertilizers (Abdel-Raouf N, 2012). Microalgae contain several\
    \ \nnutrients, especially those removed from the treated sewage for their recycling\
    \ (De-\nBashan and Bashan, 2004) and generating biomass in a fast and efficient\
    \ way \ncompared to other photosynthetic organisms, being up to 10 times more\
    \ \nphotosynthetic efficient than plants (Singh and Ahluwalia, 2013). \nConsidering\
    \ that CSA is oriented to reduce GHG emissions and enhance \nthe productivity\
    \ of agricultural ecosystems, microalgae culture and production can \nbe a decisive\
    \ factor for future scenarios. Several experiments were conducted to \nstudy the\
    \ benefits of microalgae in agriculture, from the fertility perspective (Mulbry\
    \ \net al., 2005; Raposo and Morais, 2011; Renuka et al., 2016; Shaaban, 2001)\
    \ to the \nenvironmental approach (Castro et al., 2017; Egle et al., 2016; Renuka\
    \ et al., 2016). \nMicroalgae technology for production is under continuous development,\
    \ \nand there is a place for improvements. This section of the text is focused\
    \ on \ndescribing the microalgae and its production, emphasizing the management\
    \ and the \nneed for controlling the production systems in terms of biological\
    \ composition. \n \n2.2.1 Microalgae overview \nMicroalgae are diverse, unicellular\
    \ microorganisms that grow in multiple \nenvironments. The three most important\
    \ classes of microalgae in terms of \nabundance are the diatoms (Bacillariophyceae),\
    \ the green algae (Chlorophyceae), \nand the golden algae (Chrysophyceae). All\
    \ these microalgae are eukaryotes \ndistinguished by the presence of a nucleus\
    \ and separate organelles for \nphotosynthesis, the chloroplasts, and for respiration,\
    \ mitochondria. Likewise, some \nprokaryote organisms are also considered as microalgae\
    \ for their photosynthesis \ncapacity, the cyanobacteria, or as commonly known,\
    \ blue-green algae \n(Cyanophyceae). The cyanobacteria are part of the eubacteria,\
    \ and as a prokaryote, \nis lacking a membrane-bounded nucleus. There are thousands\
    \ of different species \nof microalgae considering this classification (Enzing\
    \ et al., 2014). \n20 \n \n \n \nFrom all these thousands of species, only a few\
    \ are being produced \ncommercially today, primarily for high-value products (Rickman\
    \ et al., 2013). \nMicroalgae have been proposed for a wide range of applications,\
    \ from the \nproduction of foods and animal feed, cosmetics, biofuels and wastewater\
    \ treatment \nprocesses (Borowitzka, 2013; Chisti, 2007; Enzing et al., 2014;\
    \ Olguín, 2012). \nMicroalgae are cultivated at an industrial scale in two widespread\
    \ systems, \nthe open-culture systems and the closed-culture systems (Figure 3).\
    \ Open-culture \nsystems, for example, open ponds and raceways, are the simplest\
    \ and less expensive \nin comparison to closed-culture systems. Open-culture systems\
    \ are almost always \nlocated outdoors and rely on natural light for illumination.\
    \ Unfortunately, the \nmicroalgae culture can be easily contaminated, and little\
    \ control of the operating \nconditions can be made on such systems (De Andrade\
    \ et al., 2016). Closed-culture \nsystems, such as tubular photobioreactors, allow\
    \ a certain control level of operating \nconditions and to avoid contamination,\
    \ being possible to obtain high-value algal \nproducts. Closed photobioreactors\
    \ may be located indoors or outdoors, but the \noutdoor location is more common\
    \ because it can make use of free sunlight (Molina \nGrima et al., 2003). \n \n\

    culture system (b). \n \nDespite the large variety of applications proposed, only\
    \ a few are presently \nperformed at the commercial scale using a limited number\
    \ of algal strains. Examples \nof this are the production of carotenoids, beta-carotene\
    \ and astaxanthin from \nDunaliella salina and Haematococcus pluvialis (Forján\
    \ et al., 2014), biomass for \nfoods from Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis\
    \ (Fradique et al., 2010), and \na \nb \nTheoretical Background \n \n21 \n \n\
    \ \n \nbiomass for aquaculture from Nannochloropsis gaditana, Tetraselmis suecica\
    \ and \nIsochrysis galbana T-ISO (Shields and Lupatsch, 2012). \nMicroalgae have\
    \ other applications such as carbon sequestration by \ntransferring the environmental\
    \ CO2 into the microalgae mass (Acién et al., 2012; \nSobczuk et al., 2002), wastewater\
    \ treatment (Acién et al., 2016; Ledda et al., 2015), \nand microalgae biomass\
    \ fertilizers (Mulbry et al., 2005; Raposo and Morais, 2011; \nShaaban, 2001).\
    \ For fertilization, microalgae are a source of one of the scarcest \nnutrient,\
    \ the phosphorus, which is abundant in the algal mass (Egle et al., 2016; \nMelia\
    \ et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2015). Despite being effective, these alternative\
    \ \nuses are not implemented at commercial scale yet. \nHowever, recent advances\
    \ allow the scientific community to be optimistic \nin the development of production\
    \ technologies which are more economically viable, \nand within the next 10 to\
    \ 15 years these technologies will allow applications that \nare not viable at\
    \ present (Acién et al., 2014). New technologies are in development \nto decrease\
    \ the cost of microalgae production such as species selection, supplies \noptimization,\
    \ and better condition controls (Collet et al., 2011; Madkour et al., \n2012).\
    \ These advances make the microalgae biomass one of the most attractive \nalternatives\
    \ for fertilizers in agriculture and CO2 sequestration to achieve the CSA \nobjectives\
    \ of mitigating and reduce the GHG emissions and improve agricultural \nsustainability.\
    \ \n \n2.2.2 Specificity in microalgae production systems \nFor microalgae cultures\
    \ and the harvested product, it is often required the \nmaintenance of monoalgal\
    \ cultures when a specific compound is desired. Whereas \nwhen focusing on biofuel\
    \ production or wastewater treatment, the utilization of \nmixed cultures is usually\
    \ acceptable. In the case of mixed algal cultures, the relative \ncomposition\
    \ is gradually modified according to changes in environmental or \noperational\
    \ conditions (Godos et al., 2009). \nMonitoring the biological composition of\
    \ microalgae cultures is a \nnecessary task, generally performed through routine\
    \ microscopic examination. By \nmeans of light microscopy, an expert can distinguish\
    \ the presence of a \n“contaminating” microorganism and whether the current algal\
    \ strain is close to the \nexpected value. However, only highly skilled taxonomists\
    \ are capable of correctly \nrecognizing algal strains (their species and genera)\
    \ using light microscopy \n22 \n \n \n \nobservation solely based on morphology\
    \ – this is because most of the strains are \nsmall round cells with similar features,\
    \ only a few have easily recognizable \nmorphology. Some microalgae can be classified\
    \ by a computer using high-resolution \nimages for the morphological characterization\
    \ (Walker and Kumagai, 2000). This \nclassification is performed automatically\
    \ only with simple forms such as circle, \nellipse or cell sizes; complex forms\
    \ or similar species require the intervention of an \noperator, but the process\
    \ is under human error that can lead to confusion (Mirto et \nal., 2015). \nAlternative\
    \ methods, based on omics allow to accurately identify the \nmicroalgae strains\
    \ in cultures (Godhe et al., 2002), but these are expensive and \nrequire much\
    \ time (reducing time can be useful for making operation process \ndecisions).\
    \ As a standard method, biochemical analyses, such as the chlorophyll to \ncarotenoid\
    \ ratio and the fatty-acid profile have also been used as tools for verifying\
    \ \nthe biological composition of microalgae cultures; however, their precision\
    \ is \nlimited. These methods are unable to identify the presence of low-level\
    \ \ncontamination; likewise, they take time, although their cost is much lower\
    \ than that \nfor the omics methods (Serive et al., 2017; Sydney et al., 2011).\
    \ \nMicroalgae species identification up to the phylum or class levels has been\
    \ \nachieved based on the fluorescence properties of photosynthetic pigments using\
    \ \nflow cytometry (Cellamare et al., 2010). Employing light-emitting diode induced\
    \ \nfluorescence analysis is possible to differentiate between Anabaena sp. and\
    \ \nCylindrospermum sp. cells by comparing the fluorescence spectra (Ng et al.,\
    \ 2017). \nMicroalgae have photosynthetic pigments providing different spectral\
    \ signatures for \ndifferent species; thus, it is possible to build classes based\
    \ on the presence of \npigments. As a result, the relative content of chlorophyll,\
    \ carotenoids and other \npigments can be used to differentiate between diatoms,\
    \ red/green/brown \nmicroalgae, and cyanobacteria groups through their light absorption\
    \ spectra (Serive \net al., 2017). \nMicroalgae species can be distinguished by\
    \ their spectral signature. As an \nexample, Rivularia M-216 exhibits a different\
    \ absorbance signature to that of \nAnabaena variabilis ― the heterocyst absorbance\
    \ from Rivularia is more than \ndouble than that from A. variabilis at wavelengths\
    \ between 540 and 620 nm; this \nvariation is a result of the different phycocyanin\
    \ and chlorophyll contents (Nozue et \nal., 2017). The spectral signatures of\
    \ Botryococcus braunii, Chlorella sp. and \nChlorococcum littorale allow identifying\
    \ them by comparing their absorption \nindexes (Lee et al., 2013). Moreover, the\
    \ absorption spectrum in the 400 to 700 nm \nTheoretical Background \n \n23 \n\
    \ \n \n \nrange is used to determine the extinction coefficient of the biomass,\
    \ a specific \nmicroalgae strain and culture conditions indicator (Rubio Camacho\
    \ et al., 2003). \nBased on this, absorption properties could be a possible approach\
    \ to distinguish \nbetween microalgae species (Coltelli et al., 2017). \nANNs\
    \ are a powerful tool for finding relationships between experimental \ndata and\
    \ the phenomena behind these data. ANNs have been used to predict \nharmful algal\
    \ blooms in lakes (Recknagel, 1997; Tian et al., 2017), as well as \nmicroalgae\
    \ growth and biomass concentration under laboratory conditions and \noutdoor environments\
    \ (García-Camacho et al., 2016; Sharon Mano Pappu et al., \n2013). In microalgae\
    \ identification using ANN, extracted features such as the \nperimeter, shape,\
    \ area and Fourier Transform of microalgae micrographics were \nused to train\
    \ a model capable of identifying the genera Navicula, Scenedesmus, \nMicrocystis,\
    \ Oscillatoria and Chroococcus (Mosleh et al., 2012). Microalgae \nmicrographic\
    \ image processing and color analysis were used with ANN to achieve \ntaxonomic\
    \ accuracy of up to 99% by first detecting a cell in the image and \nsubsequently\
    \ extracting the detected cell color (Coltelli et al., 2017). \nConsidering the\
    \ capacity of ANNs and the light spectral signature \nproperties of microalgae,\
    \ it is possible to consider a fast and economical method \nderived from these\
    \ two elements for the biological monitoring of cultures, especially \nthose that\
    \ need a specific species composition, pure or in proportions. \n \n \n \n24 \n\
    \ \n \n \n2.3 Agricultural soil fertility \nFertility is the soil ability to supply\
    \ essential plant nutrients in adequate \namounts, proportions, and moments for\
    \ the growth and reproduction of plants \n(Bünemann et al., 2018). In the last\
    \ few decades, intensive agricultural management \npractices in European agriculture\
    \ have resulted in soil degradation (Freibauer et al., \n2004; Virto et al., 2015).\
    \ OM and N content in soils are now 30% to 60% lower than \ntheir undisturbed\
    \ (virgin) equivalents, about 44% of southern Europe lands exhibits \nlow OM content\
    \ as a result of intensive cultivation (Rusco et al., 2001). \nIn the framework\
    \ of sustainable agriculture, better soil management must \nbe addressed to preserve\
    \ and increase soil fertility in agricultural lands. Among the \nenvironmentally\
    \ friendly labors such as non-tillage, pesticides reduction and \nadministration\
    \ of fertilizers, these can be used more effectively to minimize supplies \nspending\
    \ and contamination. A fast method for estimating soil nutritional content \n\
    can help in the process of decision-making. \nSoil color contents some information\
    \ about fertility (Barrios and Trejo, \n2003; Fleming et al., 2004; Gray and Morant,\
    \ 2003). The analysis of this property \nthrough machine vision can help to characterize\
    \ soils. In consideration, the \ndescription of machine vision, color theory,\
    \ and soil color properties will be \nreviewed in the section below. \n \n2.3.1\
    \ Machine vision and color theory \nComputer vision (CV) is the science of the\
    \ design and operation of the \nsoftware for the analysis and processing of image,\
    \ whereas Machine Vision (MV), \nmeans a more global concept: the study of the\
    \ hardware environment, the image \nacquisition techniques and the software, CV,\
    \ needed for the development of \napplications (Davies, 2018). Following its origin\
    \ in the 1960s, MV has experienced \nsignificant growth, and its applications\
    \ started to expand until the present in diverse \nfields like medical diagnostic\
    \ imaging, factory automation, remote sensing, \nforensics, autonomous vehicle\
    \ and robot guidance (Brosnan and Sun, 2004). \nRegarding the hardware for MV,\
    \ the acquisition system is usually \ncomposed of three main components: a color\
    \ digital camera, an illumination source, \nand an image processing software.\
    \ The lighting source must provide uniform and \nconsistent illumination across\
    \ the sample to photograph, color temperature is also \nTheoretical Background\
    \ \n \n25 \n \n \n \nconsidered and usually fixed around 5,000 K to 5,500 K. To\
    \ ensure uniform \nillumination conditions, multiple light sources can be employed\
    \ as long as they are \nhomogeneous (Tarlak et al., 2016; Valous et al., 2009).\
    \ The camera is usually located \nat a certain distance so that the measurement\
    \ does not interfere with the \nillumination since the resulting images are highly\
    \ affected by the light (ten Bosch \nand Coops, 1995). \nBesides a digital color\
    \ camera in a single setup, the most used for \ncomputer vision, dual cameras\
    \ setups for stereoscopic image analysis can be used \nin controlled conditions\
    \ as was previously described, the stereoscopic setups are \nused for objects\
    \ dimension calculation inside the images (Zion, 2012). Multiple color \ncameras\
    \ mounted in drones are usually used in outdoors studies (Rumpler et al., \n2017),\
    \ or infrared cameras both indoors and outdoors (Celenk, 1990) are some \nacquisition\
    \ systems employed in MV. \nIn the software aspect, the CV is composed of several\
    \ algorithms and a vast \nnumber of variations of them that help the processing\
    \ of a digital image. Between \nthe most common algorithms are segmentation, thresholding,\
    \ shape and edge \ndetections, morphological operations, color extraction, among\
    \ others (Chen, 2015). \n \n2.3.1.1 Computer vision algorithms \nIn CV processing,\
    \ several algorithms intervene; the main ones are \nsegmentation, thresholding,\
    \ shape and edge detections. A brief description of these \nalgorithms is presented\
    \ in the paragraphs below: \n \nA. Segmentation \nSegmentation consists of separate\
    \ uniform and homogeneous regions of \na digital image, generally objects, with\
    \ respect to some background or other \nheterogeneous segments of the image (He\
    \ et al., 1985). Segmentation, for \ninstance, is used to differentiate landscape\
    \ sections in remote sensing or \ndifferent tissues in biomedical images and to\
    \ extract these objects/parts from \nthe background, identifying blood cells in\
    \ biomedical pictures, detecting \nmachinery parts, among others (Prats-Montalbán\
    \ et al., 2011). \n \n \n26 \n \n \n \nB. Thresholding \nThresholding is a type\
    \ of segmentation. A given threshold value is applied \nto the pixels in a gray-scaled\
    \ image, and pixels are classified according to this \nthreshold in a binary image\
    \ that results from this operation (Sudarsan et al., \n2016). A binary image indicates\
    \ that the pixel value of  “1” is where the pixel past \nthe threshold and the\
    \ pixels with value “0” indicate the segment did not pass the \nthreshold (Promdaen\
    \ et al., 2014). The binary image is a mask that can be used, \nwhich contains\
    \ less information and is easier to process by the machine (Zhang \net al., 2017).\
    \ For instance, after the thresholding, a morphological operation can \nbe performed\
    \ in order to fill the possible holes presented in the binary image \n(Mery and\
    \ Pedreschi, 2005). \n \nC. Shape detections \nShape detections can be performed\
    \ through several algorithms that \ncompare matrices corresponding to shapes,\
    \ such as circles, squares, triangles, \nand other more complex figures, with\
    \ a sample image in which these matrices \nare compared. When the matrix patterns\
    \ are found in the image, it means that a \ngiven shape is present in the image\
    \  (Allili and Corriveau, 2007). Object detection \nis an essential and challenging\
    \ task; this becomes particularly tricky in images \nwith a strongly cluttered\
    \ background, and with objects subjected to scale \nchanges, rotation changes,\
    \ and substantial intra-class variations (Wei et al., \n2017). \n \nD. Edge detection\
    \ \nEdge detection methods are commonly applied to the image to assess any \n\
    change in the intensity profile of neighboring pixels; therefore, a substantial\
    \ \nintensity change between an object and the background corresponds to accurate\
    \ \nedge information and yields excellent results (Williams et al., 2014). The\
    \ main \nchallenges for edge detection are due to pixels noise in the background\
    \ or \nanother object interfering with the edge of the object of interest (Lu\
    \ et al., 2010). \nIn addition, there is the concept of regions of interest (ROI).\
    \ The ROI is assigned \non the image in specific coordinates and has a given size,\
    \ for instance, 60 × 60 \npixels at the position x = 200 and y = 200 in a digital\
    \ image (Sumriddetchkajorn \net al., 2014). From this ROI, multiple operations\
    \ and analysis can be performed \ninside this region, including edge detection,\
    \ among others (Losson et al., 2013). \nTheoretical Background \n \n27 \n \n \n\
    \ \n2.3.1.2 Color theory and systems  \nThe color is the result of the interaction\
    \ of certain light wavelengths with \nan object; this is an attempt to relegate\
    \ color to the purely physical domain. Instead, \nit is proper to state that those\
    \ stimuli are perceived to be of a particular color when \nviewed under specified\
    \ conditions (Fairchild, 2013). In terms of computer vision, \ncolor is given\
    \ by the R (red), G (green), and B (blue) tristimulus values. A color image \n\
    is usually provided by the three values, RGB, at each pixel. In a typical 8-bit\
    \ image, \neach component can take values from 0 to 255 (Celenk, 1990). Values\
    \ of RGB show \nthe total amounts of the three primaries that are required to\
    \ make a color inside the \nRGB color system space (Gershon, 2005). In this system,\
    \ the pure red color is given \nby (255, 0, 0), white by (255, 255, 255), black\
    \ by (0, 0, 0) and so on combining the \ncomponents. A scheme of the RGB system\
    \ is shown in  Figure 4. \n \nFigure 4. RGB color system diagram. Purple, amber\
    \ and light blue color RGB values \nare described. \n \nPurple \n(224, 64, 251)\
    \ \nAmber \n(255, 160, 0) \nLight blue \n(3, 169, 244) \nB \nG \nR \n0 \n255 \n\
    255 \n255 \n28 \n \n \n \nIn CV, RGB color features are important as a mechanism\
    \ to a rapid and \nnon-destructive inspection of objects (Xia et al., 2016). The\
    \ color can be used to \nestimate the quality and maturity of tomatoes, citrus,\
    \ cranberries, mangos and \nestimate chemical components associated with indices\
    \ of quality, such as Brix \ndegrees (Francis, 1995; Jha et al., 2007). Others\
    \ studies with color images were \nconducted for meat color and quality (Trinderup\
    \ et al., 2015), water purity analysis \n(Andrade et al., 2013), and Earth surface\
    \ color and texture assessments (Zhao et al., \n2016). \nIn these types of studies,\
    \ a colorimeter is typically the first option for color \nmeasurements. However,\
    \ the colorimeter shows some limitations because of the \nnon-homogeneous color\
    \ in the surface of the object to analyze, especially in food \nengineering and\
    \ research ― colorimeters analyzes points, not the whole surface \n(Barbin et\
    \ al., 2016; Girolami et al., 2013; Yam and Papadakis, 2004). In this aspect,\
    \ \nthe color analysis of the digital images through CV is an advantage. \nIn\
    \ research, color is frequently represented using the L*a*b* coordinates \nof\
    \ the CIELAB color space. This color model is considered of uniform proximity,\
    \ i.e., \nthe distance between two colors in a linear color space corresponds\
    \ to the perceived \ndifferences between them (Mendoza et al., 2006). The CIELAB\
    \ system was proposed \nby the International Commission on Illumination (CIE -\
    \ by its initials in French, the \nCommission Internationale de l'Eclairage).\
    \ \nIn this color space, the positive a* axis points in the direction of red color,\
    \ \nthe negative axis in the direction of green stimuli; positive b* points in\
    \ the direction \nof yellow stimuli; negative b* in the direction of blue stimuli.\
    \ L* is the luminance; \nthus a value “0” of lightness indicates the black or\
    \ non-lightness and “100” represent \nthe white in saturated light conditions\
    \ (Schanda, 2007), a scheme is presented in \nFigure 5. \nThe L*a*b* color is\
    \ device independent, providing consistent color \nregardless of the input or\
    \ output device such as digital camera, scanner, monitor, \nand printer (Yam and\
    \ Papadakis, 2004). This is the crucial difference between RGB \nand L*a*b*, RGB\
    \ is device dependent and the color of a given picture, under equal \nillumination\
    \ conditions, leads different cameras to obtain different colors, in fact, \n\
    vastly different in colors are usually obtained among cameras (Ilie and Welch,\
    \ 2005; \nKim et al., 2012). There are other device dependent color systems such\
    \ as HSL (for \nhue, saturation and luminance), HSI (for hue, saturation and intensity)\
    \ and HSV (for \nhue, saturation and value), which are mathematically similar\
    \ and can be calculated \nTheoretical Background \n \n29 \n \n \n \nfrom the RGB;\
    \ these color systems are commonly used in image processing \n(Saravanan et al.,\
    \ 2016). \n \nFigure 5. CIELAB color space representation. Purple, amber and light\
    \ blue L*a*b* \ncolors are described. \n \nTo address the non-uniformity results\
    \ of digital cameras, a colorchecker is \noften used. A colorchecker is a color\
    \ calibrated array of cards that help to tune \ncameras and counteract the variability\
    \ among them. Colorchecker have different \nnatural colors (red, blue, green,\
    \ yellow, and others), grey tones, black and white; \nand with computer software\
    \ the image color is modified according to the color cards \nto balance the image\
    \ (Girolami et al., 2013; Kirillova et al., 2017; Potočnik et al., \n2015). Additionally,\
    \ colorchecker can also be used to convert the RGB values of the \nimage into\
    \ CIELAB standards if the manufacturer provides the L*a*b*  data of the \ncards.\
    \ \nThe RGB to L*a*b* color transformation can be performed through several \n\
    methods such as equation systems (Barbin et al., 2016), quadratic models, (Tarlak\
    \ \net al., 2016), linear models and ANN (Afshari-Jouybari and Farahnaky, 2011).\
    \ \nBetween these methods, ANN present remarkable results for this conversion\
    \ \n(Afshari-Jouybari and Farahnaky, 2011; León et al., 2006; Pedreschi et al.,\
    \ 2006; \n+b* \n-b* \n-a* \n+a* \nL* \n128 \n0 \n-128 \n128 \n-128 \n100 \nPurple\

    \ agricultural soils, and as in the fruit \nexamples; examine possible relations\
    \ between color and chemical properties, \nprincipally for nutrients and other\
    \ fertility parameters. \n \n2.3.2 Soil color and fertility properties \nThe soil\
    \ is described as a complex and heterogeneous system with \ninteractions with\
    \ physical, chemical, and biological components (Awiti et al., 2008). \nSoil management\
    \ techniques are crucial for minimizing the impact in the use of this \nlimited\
    \ resource and have a strong influence in sustainable food production, \nbiofuels,\
    \ nutrient depletion issues and environmental concerns related to soils \n(Brevik\
    \ and Hartemink, 2010). In agricultural soil management, soil fertility \nproperties\
    \ are one of the main concerns; usually, laboratory analyses are used to \ndeterminate\
    \ soil properties to plan the management. Nevertheless, under the \ncurrent situations\
    \ ― in which a large number of samples are required to develop a \nvariable fertilization\
    \ plan, conventional methods of soil analyses take a long time, in \naddition\
    \ to their expensive costs (Mohamed et al., 2016). \nThe complexity and cost of\
    \ conventional soil analyses methods and field \nsurveys lead to the development\
    \ of indirect estimation methods based on proximal \nand remote sensing (Curcio\
    \ et al., 2013) such as visible–near infrared (vis-NIR) \nspectroscopy (Conforti\
    \ et al., 2015; Stenberg, 2010; Viscarra Rossel et al., 2009) and \nsoil color\
    \ sensing (Baumann et al., 2016; Castañeda and Moret-Fernández, 2013; \nHausmann\
    \ et al., 2016), through these studies it has been possible to establish the \n\
    relationship of these properties with soil OM content, organic carbon, clay, silt,\
    \ and \nsand and other minerals such as content, kaolinite, haematite and goethite.\
    \ \nColor is an easily measurable physical attribute of soil through \ncolorimeters,\
    \ color sensors, computer scanners and smartphone cameras (Han et \nal., 2016;\
    \ Kirillova et al., 2017; Stiglitz et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). The difference\
    \ \nin soil color has often been used in the soil classification (Maejima et al.,\
    \ 2000), \ndifferent studies indicate that the OM influences the soil color, darker\
    \ soils have \nmore OM (Kweon and Maxton, 2013). Iron oxides show both redness\
    \ and \nyellowness (Vodyanitskii and Kirillova, 2016), other properties such as\
    \ clay and \nhumus contents also is related with the redness of the soil (Hu et\
    \ al., 2014). \nTheoretical Background \n \n31 \n \n \n \nThe Munsell color system\
    \ is one of the most widespread among soil \nscientists (Vodyanitskii and Savichev,\
    \ 2017). In the Munsell System, the color is \ndescribed by three factors such\
    \ as hue, value and chroma. Hue is the color name \nsuch as Red (R), Yellow-Red\
    \ (YR), Blue-Green (BG), among others. Value is a number; \nusually, from 8 to\
    \ 2, that represents the lightness or darkness, a higher number \nstands for a\
    \ lighter color and vice-versa. The chroma represents how weak or strong \nis\
    \ a color; the minimum of 2 is a grayish color and maximum of 14 is a pure saturated\
    \ \ncolor. Every color is alpha-numerically labeled with a letter for the hue\
    \ and numbers \nfor the value and chroma, for instance, 5Y 5/6 ― the number before\
    \ the hue letter \nindicates a subdivision of hue (Cochrane, 2014; Tokumaru et\
    \ al., 2002). An example \nof the Munsell color system is shown in Figure 6. \n\

    \ color system has a severe drawback – the cylindrical \ncoordinates complicate\
    \ its use in statistical calculations (Vodyanitskii and Kirillova, \n2016). The\
    \ CIELAB system is more convenient and suitable for soil scientists, since it\
    \ \nrepresents a universal color space in cartesian coordinates, for instance,\
    \ Fe content \ncontribution in soil color is more significant in the L*a*b* coordinate\
    \ system than in \nthe Munsell system, because this latter is divided into discrete\
    \ and rough intervals \n(Kirillova et al., 2015). \nA suitable method to analyze\
    \ and correlate color with fertility parameters \nof soil is the utilization of\
    \ ANNs. ANNs can learn and generalize based on previous \nobservations, and they\
    \ can often correctly predict with high accuracies when the \ndata interaction\
    \ is complex for other techniques (Khashei and Bijari, 2010). ANNs for \ndigital\
    \ soil mapping could reduce costs and time in semi-detailed soil surveys with\
    \ \nlimited input data thought data interpolation and extrapolation (Bagheri \n\
    Bodaghabadi et al., 2016). An ANN approach was used to determine relationships\
    \ \nbetween soil color and a range of physical and chemical characteristics, using\
    \ the \ndatabase of National Soil Inventory of Scotland in an extensive scale\
    \ survey \n(Aitkenhead et al., 2013). \n \n \n \nTheoretical Background \n \n\

    \ of the atmospheric science responsible for \nproviding weather forecast and\
    \ communicates to the users who will use this data. \nOther than that, another\
    \ important task of meteorology is to increase the \nknowledge of the atmosphere,\
    \ with constant endeavor through research and \ndevelopment to improve the accuracy\
    \ of the weather forecast (Rao, 2008). \nRegarding the agricultural meteorology,\
    \ the data generated in the last 20 \nyears were useful to study plants growth,\
    \ pests and pathogens appearance and \npropagation, water cycle, and protection\
    \ of the crops from extreme conditions \n(Waggoner, 2016). The meteorological\
    \ conditions vary in microscales and are \nsubjected to several local elements\
    \ and phenomena (Robitu et al., 2006), for that, \nresearch is needed to provide\
    \ additional information to farmers and the \nmicroclimate in regions where no\
    \ source of meteorological data is emplaced. In this \nsection, the importance\
    \ of meteorological data for agricultural development will be \nreviewed and possible\
    \ manners to generate an accurate estimation of these data \nwill be presented\
    \ as an alternative to acquiring information for better crop \nmanagement. \n\
    \ \n2.4.1 Meteorological information and agricultural importance \nAgriculture\
    \ is one of the most sensitive activities to weather conditions, \nand the climate\
    \ change has several impacts in this sector, from food production to \neconomic\
    \ problems in agriculture and related industries, making food security a \ntangible\
    \ problem in the next few decades (Decker, 1994; Mason d’Croz et al., 2013; \n\
    Springmann et al., 2016). Meteorological conditions are essential for cultures,\
    \ and \ncertain conditions must be met for their development (Griffiths, 1994).\
    \ \nNonetheless, some changes have occurred, climatic anomalies and the \nmodification\
    \ of precipitations regimens are striking the agriculture (Luo et al., 2019).\
    \ \nIn recent years, weather and climate have become an issue of interest for\
    \ scientists, \nmedia and population because of the harmful effects associated\
    \ with global \nwarming (Ahrens, 2012; Webster, 2013), and humans activities have\
    \ been reported \nas one of the leading causes (Barry and Chorley, 2009). \nThe\
    \ knowledge of weather conditions helps to make better decisions in \ncrops management,\
    \ elaborate sowing calendars, pest population models (Naylor et \n34 \n \n \n\
    \ \nal., 2018), and precision irrigation dosage (Teshome et al., 2018). For instance,\
    \ \nirrigated agriculture is the primary water user, accounting for nearly 70%\
    \ of total \nwater consumption in the world (Conforti, 2011) and that consumption\
    \ can be \nreduced using evapotranspiration models such as the proposed by the\
    \ FAO (Allen et \nal., 1998), which require prior knowledge of meteorological\
    \ variables. \nMeteorological observations are obtained through automatic weather\
    \ \nstations, which are increasing throughout the world in the form of station\
    \ networks \n(Estévez et al., 2011). Nonetheless, the cost of an automatic weather\
    \ station is still \nexpensive and are not an attractive investment for most farmers.\
    \ Considering the \ncomplex nature of the atmosphere and the massive computational\
    \ power required \nto solve all of the equations that describe the atmosphere,\
    \ the forecasts is also an \nexpensive technique and new manners to obtain meteorological\
    \ information more \nefficiently and less costly is becoming an interesting matter\
    \ (Akram and El, 2016). \n \n2.4.2 Meteorological data estimation  \nWith new\
    \ techniques for data processing and analysis, such as ANNs, novel \nmethods have\
    \ been developed for forecasting; precipitations (Hung et al., 2009; \nPartal\
    \ et al., 2015) wind speed (Cao et al., 2012), forecasting sea level in coastal\
    \ \nareas (de Oliviera et al., 2009; Filippo et al., 2012) and air quality forecasting\
    \ (Feng \net al., 2015; Hrust et al., 2009). ANNs were also used for daily estimation\
    \ of solar \nradiation (Amrouche and Le Pivert, 2014; Hasni et al., 2012; Şenkal\
    \ and Kuleli, 2009), \npower generation in wind energy systems (Fan et al., 2009;\
    \ Olaofe, 2014; Sideratos \nand Hatziargyriou, 2007) and the estimation of evapotranspiration\
    \ (Abrishami et al., \n2018; Ballesteros et al., 2016; Chowdhury et al., 2017;\
    \ Cooper, 2010). However, all \nthese studies worked based on measured data, i.e.,\
    \ were driven by previous known \nmeteorological data to use them as the input\
    \ to create models, there is a lack of \nstudies focused on generating the first\
    \ data and validating its quality using ANN. \nInterpolation is a way to generate\
    \ data in geographical locations where no \ndata is acquired. Although deterministic\
    \ and parametric statistical models have \nbeen the traditional approaches for\
    \ data interpolation, such as inverse distance \nweighting, inverse squared distance\
    \ weighting (Li and Heap, 2011; Lu and Wong, \n2008) and multilinear regression\
    \ (Jin et al., 2016; Nalder and Wein, 1998); there are \nstudies with new approaches\
    \ such as random forest regression (RFR) machine \nlearning method and ANN (Li\
    \ et al., 2011; Li and Heap, 2014; Wang et al., 2009). \nTheoretical Background\
    \ \n \n35 \n \n \n \nRegarding interpolation studies of meteorological variables,\
    \ methods such \nas Thiessen polygons, kriging, regressions, nearest neighbor\
    \ and inverse to distance \nweighted were employed to mainly interpolate precipitations\
    \ and temperatures \nwith different levels of accuracy (Berndt and Haberlandt,\
    \ 2018; Jeffrey et al., 2001; \nMendez and Calvo-Valverde, 2016; Wagner et al.,\
    \ 2012; Wu and Li, 2013). \nConsidering these facts, an ANN approach for data\
    \ interpolation can be an \nexciting alternative given its capability in modeling\
    \ and solving complex nonlinear \nproblems (Voyant et al., 2017). Generating more\
    \ data and time series in various \nlocations can be the basis for other studies,\
    \ for instance, pathogen infestation in \nfarms (Tripathy et al., 2011), planning\
    \ water management (Chowdhury et al., 2017; \nValipour, 2016) or checking the\
    \ performance of solar energy based equipment and \nbuilding in terms of energy\
    \ consumption, especially for heating and cooling (Kumar \net al., 2015; Shu Fan\
    \ et al., 2009), using good quality interpolated data. \nMeteorological data is\
    \ an essential class of temporal record that can be \nuseful for agricultural,\
    \ energy, scientific, financial, and other applications. Since it is \nnot possible\
    \ to emplace a weather station in every location where data is needed, \nmore\
    \ research and information are needed to estimate meteorological data \neconomically\
    \ and accurately — especially considering the importance of this type of \ninformation\
    \ in agriculture for crop management (Dahikar and Rode, 2014; Iizumi \nand Ramankutty,\
    \ 2015; Kang et al., 2009; O. Rauff and Bello, 2015). \n \n \n \n36 \n \n \n \n\
    2.5 Artificial neural networks  \nAn ANN is a mathematical/computational model\
    \ that is inspired by the \nstructure and functional aspects of biological neural\
    \ networks. It is a highly accepted \ntechnology to alternatively solve complex\
    \ problems (Bouselham et al., 2017). \nComparative surveys show that accuracy\
    \ of ANN methods is superior to that of \ntraditional statistical methods in dealing\
    \ with problems, especially regarding \nnonlinear patterns (Bahrammirzaee, 2010).\
    \ \nANN belongs to machine learning (ML) set of techniques. ML can be \ndescribed\
    \ as such algorithms capable of producing learning by the mathematics in \nthe\
    \ models, and the fine-tuning of several parameters responsible for fitting the\
    \ \ninput data to the target. The optimization of such parameters could be understood\
    \ \nas an unknown black-box function that invokes algorithms developed for such\
    \ \nproblems (Snoek et al., 2012). Besides ANN, other remarkable ML algorithms\
    \ are \ndecision trees, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors,\
    \ among \nothers (Maglogiannis, 2007). \nIn the following sections, an overview\
    \ of ANN is presented. The ANN \nfundamentals, components, structures, and mathematics\
    \ behind this technique are \ndescribed. The review includes the basic units of\
    \ ANNs, the artificial neuron or \nperceptron, how the learning is achieved through\
    \ this technique, to the validation \nof the models for posterior inferences,\
    \ classifications, and predictions. \n \n2.5.1 The artificial neuron \nAnimals\
    \ have complex brains composed of hundreds or thousands of \nmillions of elements\
    \ called neurons; the number varies according to species. In \nhumans, the brain\
    \ consists of approximately 1011 neurons – in this text animal, and \nconsequently,\
    \ human neurons will be referred to as biological neurons. These units \nare highly\
    \ interconnected (approximately 104 synapses or connections per neuron), \nand\
    \ an electromagnetic signal is passed through them, this signal is information\
    \ that \nroves the brain, being processed by the neurons and derives into the\
    \ diverse forms \nof actions or reactions (Zurada, 1992). \nThe biological neuron\
    \ is a highly specialized cell type. Morphologically \nthree major regions can\
    \ be defined (Figure 7): a cell body (or soma), which contains \nthe nucleus;\
    \ a variable number of dendrites, which emanate from the soma and \nTheoretical\
    \ Background \n \n37 \n \n \n \nramify; and a single axon, which extends far from\
    \ the soma and has numerous \nterminals to interconnect to other neurons dendrites\
    \ (Squire et al., 2008). \n \nFigure 7. Biological neuron cell scheme. The signal\
    \ travels from left to right, from \nthe dendrites (input), passing through the\
    \ body or soma and going out through the \naxon and its terminals. \n \nAn artificial\
    \ neuron is a simple mathematical model inspired in its \nbiological counterpart.\
    \ Artificial neurons produce an output value in two steps. First, \nthe neuron\
    \ computes a weighted sum of its signals, input variables for the case, and, \n\
    in a second stage, applies an activation function to this sum to derive the product\
    \ as \nthe output (Russell and Norvig, 2016). \nIn 1943, McCulloch and Pitts proposed\
    \ the first artificial neuron model – \ntoday is known as the perceptron, composed\
    \ of binary threshold activation function \n(Figure 8). This mathematical neuron\
    \ computes a weighted sum of its input signals \nand generates an output of “1”\
    \ if this sum is above a certain threshold, “0” or \nanother positive number,\
    \ otherwise, the function returns “0” as a result, this logic \nis also known\
    \ as hardlim function (Jain et al., 1996). \nDendrites \nSoma \nAxon \nAxon \n\

    \ Where xn = inputs and wn = weights. \nThe sum of products of inputs and weights\
    \ plus the bias is passed to the activation \nfunction (σ) to generate the neuron\
    \ output (\U0001D466̂). \n \nThe perceptron applies a linear combination of its\
    \ inputs, obtaining the \nsignal in which is applied an activation function to\
    \ obtain the output signal. \nNonlinear functions are the most used ones to give\
    \ the perceptron nonlinear \nbehavior (Martínez-Martínez et al., 2015). The mathematical\
    \ model of the \nperceptron is presented in Eq. 1: \nWere \U0001D466̂ is the neuron\
    \ output; \U0001D70E is the activation function; \U0001D465 is the input \nvector\
    \ of \U0001D45B elements; \U0001D464 is the weight vector and \U0001D44F\U0001D456\
    \U0001D44E\U0001D460 is a value that allows the sift \nof the activation function.\
    \ The bias is somehow similar to the constant \U0001D44F of a linear \nfunction\
    \ \U0001D466 = \U0001D44E\U0001D465 + \U0001D44F. \n \nThe biological neuron and\
    \ the artificial neuron, the perceptron, are \ncomparable in certain manners,\
    \ a parallelism from an operational point of view can \nbe described as follows:\
    \ the weight (\U0001D464) corresponds to the strength of a synapse, \nthe neuron\
    \ body is represented by the summation and the activation function, and \nthe\
    \ neuron output (\U0001D466̂) is represented by the signal on the axon (Mindiola\
    \ et al., \n2015). In the perceptron, the analogous of the of electromagnetic\
    \ signals in the \nprocessing of brain are, in deep, mathematical operations that\
    \ take place in \nprocessor and random access memory (RAM) of a computer (Misra\
    \ and Saha, 2010). \n\U0001D466̂ =  \U0001D70E (∑ \U0001D465\U0001D456\U0001D464\

    \ artificial neural network \nThe perceptron by itself does not have a lot of\
    \ processing power, especially \nwhen it is compared to an ANN, which is composed\
    \ of several layers of perceptrons. \nANN can be defined as a highly connected\
    \ array of neurons, which are \ninterconnected with each other; a widely used\
    \ model called the multi-layered \nperceptron (MLP) is the most common type of\
    \ ANN (Haykin, 1999; Park et al., 1991). \nThe MLP consists of one input layer,\
    \ one or more hidden layers, and one output \nlayer. Each layer employs several\
    \ neurons, and each neuron in a layer is connected \nto the neurons in the adjacent\
    \ layer with different weights, which is used to \ndetermine how much one unit\
    \ will affect the other (Chen et al., 2005). \nNeural networks are typically represented\
    \ by a network diagram, which is \ncomposed of nodes connected by directed links.\
    \ Nodes are arranged in layers, and \nthe structure of the most used neural network\
    \ consists of three layers: an input, a \nhidden and an output layer of nodes\
    \ (Figure 9), signals flow into the input layer, pass \nthrough the hidden layers,\
    \ and arrive at the output layer in a unidirectional path in \nthe MLP (Hastie\
    \ et al., 2009). \nANN is a kind of array which can realize a nonlinear mapping\
    \ from the \ninputs to the outputs (Rui and El-Keib, 1995). Thereby, the input\
    \ neurons receive the \ndata, and the inputs and weights products are computed;\
    \ the signals enter the \nhidden layer where a sum is performed, a bias is added,\
    \ and an activation function \nis applied in each neuron. Then, the signals leaving\
    \ the neurons in the hidden layer, \nare multiplied again by weights and enter\
    \ the neurons in the output layer, where a \nsum is performed plus the bias addition\
    \ to generate the output of the ANN. \nInitially, the McCulloch and Pitts perceptron\
    \ model presented limitations, \nand the nonlinear capability of ANN was not a\
    \ reality until long after McCulloch and \nPits pioneer work. It was not until\
    \ 1962, 20 years after the first proposal, that \nRosenblatt implemented hardware\
    \ with enough computing power to process an \narray of artificial neurons and\
    \ the term “perceptron” was coined. He proposed \nsingle-layer networks composed\
    \ of a few processing units. These networks were \napplied to classification problems,\
    \ in which the inputs were usually binary images of \ncharacters or simple shapes\
    \ (Bishop, 1995). \n \n40 \n \n \n \nFigure 9. ANN scheme. Where xn are the input\
    \ variables that enter in the input layer \nand ŷn are the outputs from the output\
    \ layer. The hidden layer contains the \nactivation function. \n \nHowever, in\
    \ a large number of interesting cases, the neurons were not \ncapable of solving\
    \ problems. A classic example is the “exclusive OR” (XOR) problem, \nwhich was\
    \ reported by Minsky and Papert in 1969 (Özbay et al., 2007). The report \nresulted\
    \ in a lack of enthusiasm and research in ANNs in the computer science \ncommunity\
    \ for almost 20 years (Basheer and Hajmeer, 2000). The recession was \nfollowed\
    \ by regeneration of ANNs with the introduction of the ANN models of \nHopfield\
    \ during the 1980s, who popularized the MLP by employing the training \nalgorithm\
    \ of backpropagation proposed by Werbos in 1974 in his doctoral thesis at \nHarvard\
    \ University, and the interest of the scientific community returned (Nastos et\
    \ \nal., 2013). This interest reborn was coupled with the rapid growth of computing\

    \ the MLP can solve different nonlinear problems, including \nthe XOR case with\
    \ a quite simple network structure (Singh, 2016). \nThe task of an MLP is to get\
    \ the desired output to the inputs of certain \ntypes. With this goal in mind,\
    \ the learning of perceptron is performed. The inputs \nand the desired outputs\
    \ are loaded to the scheme, and the error of the response is \ndetermined. The\
    \ parameters of the system, the weights in the inter-connections, \nare changed\
    \ during the learning phase of the ANN to diminish the difference \nbetween the\
    \ desired and the real output (Negrov et al., 2017). \nThe neural networks can\
    \ be classified into two classes according to its \narchitecture and interconnection\
    \ between neurons: feed-forward networks and \nfeed-back (recurrent) networks\
    \ (Tealab et al., 2017). The most popular ANN in the \nstudies is the multilayer\
    \ feed-forward network, in which the neurons are organized \ninto series of layers,\
    \ and information signal flows through the network solely in one \ndirection,\
    \ from the input layer to the output layer (Tkáč and Verner, 2016). \nMeanwhile,\
    \ in an ANN where the outputs of some neurons are feed back to the \nsame neurons\
    \ or neurons in preceding layers are called recurrent neural networks \n(RNN).\
    \ This feed-back enables a flow of information in both forward and backward \n\
    directions (Basheer and Hajmeer, 2000). This type of neural network is more focused\
    \ \nin time series predictions thanks to using as the input data part of the output\
    \ data \nfrom the previous element in the series, such as forecast financial time\
    \ series \n(Cavalcante et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018). \nWhile MLP is more focused\
    \ on solving nonlinearly separable problems, \nclassification, and approximate\
    \ continuous functions (Haykin, 1999), there is \nanother architecture of neural\
    \ networks based on the number of hidden layers; \nwhen the ANN consists of several\
    \ of perceptrons layers, the term deep neural \nnetwork (DNN) is employed (Li\
    \ et al., 2018). These types of neural networks are \nemployed by excellence for\
    \ image analysis and classifications, including videos \n(Antipov et al., 2016;\
    \ Cheng et al., 2018). However, for most of the classification and \npredictions\
    \ problems, there is no need to use more than one hidden layer (Heaton, \n2008),\
    \ in some cases augmenting the number of hidden layers can lead to the \ndetriment\
    \ of performance (de Villiers and Barnard, 1993). \nIn an MLP, adding hidden layers\
    \ and neurons are generally limited for a \nfew hidden layers. Adding more layers\
    \ not only increases the complexity of the \nmodel and the computational cost,\
    \ but it also does not ensure more accuracy or \nbetter overall performance of\
    \ the model. Experimental results indicate that ANNs \nwith two hidden layers\
    \ are prone to perform more inaccurately in comparison to \n42 \n \n \n \none\
    \ hidden layer ANNs (de Villiers and Barnard, 1993). Increasing the number of\
    \ \nhidden neurons, in forms of a neuron inside the hidden layer or increasing\
    \ the raw \nnumber of hidden layers itself, can dismiss the learning process leading\
    \ to less \naccurate models (Karlik, 2011). \nANN, especially in complex models\
    \ with several neurons and layers, have \nthe cost of the training time (Moraes\
    \ et al., 2013). Although new central processing \nunits (CPUs) are faster than\
    \ ever, have multicore structures (2 or 4 cores in general) \nand instructions\
    \ for high-performance parallel processing (Bergstra et al., 2010; \nVanhoucke\
    \ et al., 2011). Moreover, graphics processing units (GPUs) can be used for \n\
    faster ANN implementations, due to higher capacity of parallel computing by the\
    \ \nmulticore system with hundreds of cores (Oh and Jung, 2004; Yang et al., 2011).\
    \ GPU \nimplementation of ANN can go up to 50 or 60 times faster than standard\
    \ CPU \nimplementations (Cires et al., 2003; Ramachandran et al., 2015). \nRegarding\
    \ ANN frameworks, there are free and open source libraries such \nas Caffe, Theano,\
    \ Torch, and TensorFlow, among others, which are widely spread \n(Abadi et al.,\
    \ 2016; Rampasek and Goldenberg, 2016). The importance of being free \nand open\
    \ source lies in the affordability for use in academics and research. \nTensorFlow,\
    \ one of the frameworks that most interest has caught in developers in \nthe last\
    \ few years, is developed by the Google Brain Group, part of the Google \nMachine\

    \ et al., \n2019; Zhang and Kagen, 2017). \nSeveral ANN studies have been conducted\
    \ in distinct disciplines with \noverwhelming results; in the photovoltaic energy\
    \ industry to forecast the power \ngeneration of system under diverse climatic\
    \ scenarios (Bouselham et al., 2017; Ding \net al., 2011; Veerachary and Yadaiah,\
    \ 2000); in the industry sector to control and \nmonitoring of production process,\
    \ such as distillation (Singh et al., 2007), lifetime \nprediction of machinery\
    \ (Tian, 2012), fault diagnosis in elements of a power \ninstallation (Bi et al.,\
    \ 2000) and controlling robotics machinery (Zhao et al., 2014). In \nmedicine,\
    \ ANNs are useful for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, \ncancer\
    \ and tumors (Jiang et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2015). In the finance sector,\

    \ energy \nprices (Alanis, 2018; Chen et al., 2001), bankruptcy prediction (Li\

    \ series prediction (Abhishek \net al., 2012; Göçken et al., 2016; Kaastra and\
    \ Boyd, 1996; Moghaddam et al., 2016; \nTheoretical Background \n \n43 \n \n \n\
    \ \nPatel et al., 2015); in the telecommunication sector, neural networks can\
    \ treat and \nrecover digital information in channels when a data loss occurs\
    \ (Das et al., 2014; \nPanda et al., 2015), to cite some of the multiple examples\
    \ of ANN applications. \n \n2.5.3 Activation functions \nActivations functions\
    \ are an essential component of ANNs. In a \nperceptron, the weighted inputs are\
    \ summed and passed through a limiting \nfunction, which scales the output to\
    \ a fixed range of values. The output of the limiter \nis then broadcasted out\
    \ of the neuron to the next layer (Ozturk and Karaboga, 2011). \nIn general, S-shaped\
    \ functions, such as sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, are adopted \nfor the activation.\
    \ Once the activation function is performed, a neuron sends its \nactivated value\
    \ to the other neurons through the connections (Tsai and Wang, 2001; \nZamanlooy\
    \ and Mirhassani, 2014). \nThe activation function is typically nonlinear, and\
    \ it ensures that the entire \nnetwork can estimate a nonlinear function which\
    \ is learned from the input/output \ndata pair (Moraes et al., 2013). Nonlinear\
    \ activation function implementation \nachieve higher accuracy and improves the\
    \ learning and generalization capabilities of \nANNs in contrast to the linear\
    \ primitive functions (Zamanlooy and Mirhassani, \n2014). \nUsually, neurons in\
    \ the hidden layer are the ones that perform an \nactivation function; output\
    \ neurons, in general terms, return a weighted summation \nof the previous layer\
    \ output without any transformation. It has been reported that \na nonlinear activation\
    \ function in the output layer failed to improve the \nperformance and accuracy\
    \ of an ANN (Yonaba et al., 2010). There are several \nactivation functions, with\
    \ a diverse range of bounded outputs; according to the \nproblem to solve, one\
    \ or other activation function performs better (Gautam and \nRavi, 2015). Some\
    \ of the main activation functions are described in the subsections \nbelow. \n\
    \ \n2.5.3.1 Hardlim function \nThe hardlim function, also known as a binary step\
    \ function, was the first \nactivation function presented by McCulloch and Pitts,\
    \ fathers of the artificial \nneuron. The function gives binary output values,\
    \ “0” or “1”, “0” when the signal \n44 \n \n \n \nvalue is less than “0” and “1”\
    \ when the signal value is equal or greater than “0”. The \nformula is presented\
    \ in Eq. 2. \n\U0001D453(\U0001D465) = ℎ\U0001D44E\U0001D45F\U0001D451\U0001D459\
    \U0001D456\U0001D45A(\U0001D465) = { 0 for \U0001D465 < 0\n1 for \U0001D465 ≥\
    \ 0 \nEq. 2 \nThe function plot is shown in Figure 10. The hardlim function presents\
    \ two \npossible stages according to the input value into the activation function,\
    \ thus the \nname of the binary step. Regardless of how negative or positive the\
    \ input value is, \nthe logic of this function will always return “0” or “1”.\
    \ \n \nFigure 10. Hardlim activation function plot. \n \nHardlim is rarely used\
    \ nowadays since there is no linear relationship \nbetween inputs and output patterns\
    \ in most modern problems of interest (Abhishek \net al., 2012). Hardlim activation\
    \ function was not very effective to solve several \nproblems in comparison with\
    \ the S-shaped functions in a comparative study using \nseveral datasets from\
    \ the University of California Irvine machine learning repository \n(Zhang and\

    \ activation function is one of the most used in ANNs, and it \nrapidly replaces\
    \ the hardlim function. There are some variations of the sigmoid \nfunctions,\
    \ but the one known as logistic sigmoid is often used in studies and \napplications\
    \ (Menon et al., 1996).  The sigmoid activation function produces positive \n\
    numbers only between “0” and “1”, and the formula is presented in Eq. 3. This\
    \ \nfunction is also known as the S-shaped function, and its bounded output values\
    \ \nmake it one of the most useful in training ANNs (Sibi et al., 2013). \n\U0001D453\

    \ \nThe hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) is similar to a sigmoid function, it\
    \ is \nalso an S-shaped function but with a subtle difference; its outputs bounds\
    \ are \nbetween “-1” and “1” (Karlik, 2011). The tanh formula is presented in\
    \ Eq. 4. \n\U0001D453(\U0001D465) = tanh(\U0001D465) = \U0001D452\U0001D465 −\

    input is “0” and as more positive or more negative the input is, the proportionality\
    \ \nof the output decreases creating rough asymptotes. The function plot is shown\
    \ in \nFigure 12. \n \nFigure 12. Hyperbolic tangent activation function plot.\

    \ but might behave differently in \nterms of saturation because of its smoother\
    \ asymptotes, polynomial instead of \nexponential (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). The\
    \ softsign formula is presented in Eq. 5. \n\U0001D453(\U0001D465) = softsign(\U0001D465\

    \ to the tanh function, giving output values \nfrom “-1” to “1”. The function\
    \ plot is shown in Figure 13. This function is relatively \nnovel, first introduced\
    \ by Bergstra et al. (2009), proposing this function for better \nlearning of\
    \ image features. The applications of this activation function are mainly \nfor\
    \ image classification problems (Ertam, 2017; Kakuda et al., 2019) but it can\
    \ also \nbe employed for inference problems such as indoor temperature forecasting\
    \ \n(Romeu et al., 2013). \n \nFigure 13. Softsign activation function plot. \n\

    \ Softmax function \nThe softmax function has been extensively used in ANN, especially\
    \ in DNN \narchitectures, is one of the few activation functions placed in the\
    \ output layer due \nto its characteristics (Zheng et al., 2015). The softmax\
    \ has a classifier character since \nthe function returns a number that can be\
    \ interpreted as the probability of a \nparticular class (Dong et al., 2015).\
    \ The softmax formula is shown in Eq. 6. \n\U0001D453(\U0001D465⃗) = softmax(\U0001D465\
    ⃗) = \n\U0001D452\U0001D465\U0001D456\n∑\n\U0001D452\U0001D465\U0001D457\n\U0001D43D\

    \ \nEq. 6 \nSoftmax ensures a probability distribution, and it has the properties\
    \ that \nevery single output (\U0001D466̂\U0001D456) for a set of observations\
    \ (\U0001D465⃗) fit the condition 0 ≤ \U0001D466̂\U0001D456  ≤ 1, \nand the sum\
    \ of outputs (∑\n\U0001D466̂\U0001D457\n\U0001D43D\n\U0001D456=1\n) is equal to\
    \ “1”, as it required for probabilities \n(Bishop, 1996). Softmax activation functions\
    \ in the last layer of a text analysis ANN \ngives the probability of appearance\
    \ of words in a text string (Mikolov et al., 2010; \nTran et al., 2014). In the\
    \ same way, it computes the probable labels in sentiment \nanalysis of tweets\
    \ (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015) and gives a class probability of \ngiven images\
    \ (Nguyen et al., 2015). \n \n2.5.3.6 Rectified linear unit function \nSigmoid\
    \ neurons were for a long time the biologically more plausible \nmodel for neurons.\
    \ However, the recent work in ANNs shows that rectified linear \nunit (relu) function\
    \ is an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or \nbetter performance\
    \ than other activation functions despite the hard nonlinearity \nand non-differentiability\
    \ at zero. Rectifier networks are not only beneficial to image \nclassification\
    \ tasks, in which it is the principal function but also might yield powerful \n\
    tools in the future (Glorot et al., 2011; Maas et al., 2013). The relu activation\
    \ \nfunction formula is presented in Eq. 7. \n\U0001D453(\U0001D465) = \U0001D45F\
    \U0001D452\U0001D459\U0001D462(\U0001D465) = { 0 for \U0001D465 < 0\n \U0001D465\
    \ for \U0001D465 ≥ 0 \nEq. 7 \nSince it was first proposed by Nair and Hinton\
    \ (2010), relu functions proved \nto be efficient compared with other alternatives\
    \ in image analysis. This function was \nable to learn specific features that\
    \ are better for object recognition. The relu \nTheoretical Background \n \n49\
    \ \n \n \n \nfunction is more accurate than tanh, sigmoid, and softsign activation\
    \ functions for \nimage classification (Ertam, 2017). Therefore, relu layers are\
    \ preferred for image \nanalysis (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2015), although, they\
    \ can also be applied for \nvideo analysis (Ebrahimi Kahou et al., 2015) and automatic\
    \ speech recognition \n(Zhang and Woodland, 2016). The relu function plot is shown\
    \ in Figure 14. \n \nFigure 14. Rectified linear unit (relu) activation function\
    \ plot. \n \n2.5.4 Phases of artificial neural networks \nANNs have rapidly entered\
    \ into the panorama as a powerful tool to solve \nproblems, especially those highly\
    \ nonlinear ones that traditional models are not able \nto solve or do not achieve\
    \ the accuracy needed (Bahrammirzaee, 2010; Huang and \nBabri, 1998). The correct\
    \ implementation of ANN is a meticulous process and can be \naccomplished by following\
    \ the appropriate methodology, which ensures the \nmaximum performance of the\
    \ algorithms and the ability of the ANN to solve the \nproblems that arise. \n\
    The process can be divided into mainly 3 phases. In the first phase, \ngenerally,\
    \ the data is preprocessed before entering the ANN input layer. The second \n\

    \ learning phase; here, the training and testing are performed. \nThese two different\
    \ processes are performed in parallel and should not be \nseparated; the abstraction\
    \ capability of the model is developed during this phase. \nFinally, in the third\
    \ phase, the trained model is validated in terms of goodness and \nfit obtained\
    \ in new inferences of ANN. In the following subsections, each of these \nphases\
    \ will be detailed. \n \n2.5.4.1 Data preprocessing \nBefore the learning phase\
    \ of an ANN takes place, the dataset needs to be \nconditioned. A correctly partitioning\
    \ of the available input-output data, predictors \nand response variables, into\
    \ three different datasets such as the training, test and \nvalidation sets must\
    \ be done. These sets have specific roles for the successful \nimplementation\
    \ of ANNs (Altinay et al., 1997). By now, this subsection will be \nfocused on\
    \ the preprocessing of the data, and the roles of each dataset will be \ndetailed\
    \ in the following subsections. \nRegarding the input variables, if they are measured\
    \ in different scales or if \nthe standard deviations for the variables are different\
    \ among them, a variable might \ndominate the following calculations due to its\
    \ dimensionality (Martinez et al., 2017). \nHence, normalization or standardization\
    \ procedures are the most viable alternative \nto deal with these types of bias.\
    \ In the same manner, normalization of variables \nincreases the computational\
    \ efficiency of the ANN training process, which is also \nhighly enhanced in terms\
    \ of accurate results when it is coupled with preprocessing \ntechniques (Nawi\
    \ et al., 2013; Specht, 1991). \nNormalization of input data has the advantage\
    \ of scaling the data in the \nsame range of values for each input feature in\
    \ order to minimize bias within the \nneural network for one feature to another,\
    \ helping the system a better weight \nadjustment for each element (Jayalakshmi\
    \ and Santhakumaran, 2011). \nIn neural networks, there are fundamentally two\
    \ types of preprocessing \nmethods. The first is to standardize the data by subtracting\
    \ the mean and dividing \nby the standard deviation to make the data have a mean\
    \ of “0” and variance of “1”, \nreferred as “Z-score normalization” as is shown\
    \ in Eq. 8 (Priddy and Keller, 2005). \n \n \nTheoretical Background \n \n51 \n\

    \ and \U0001D467\U0001D456 is the normalized value for the given \ninput. \n \n\
    The second (Eq. 9), is to rescale the data to a small interval from “0” to “1”\
    \ \nusing the “Min-Max normalization” (Eberhart, 2014). \n\U0001D465\U0001D456\

    Eq. 9 \nWhere \U0001D465\U0001D456 is a given input value from a specific feature;\
    \ \U0001D465\U0001D45A\U0001D456\U0001D45B is the \nminimum observed value for\
    \ the feature; \U0001D465\U0001D45A\U0001D44E\U0001D465 is the maximum observed\
    \ value; and \n\U0001D465\U0001D456′ is the normalized or re-scaled value for\
    \ the given input. \n \nInput data normalization prior to a training process is\
    \ crucial to speed up \nthe subsequent computational calculations significantly\
    \ and obtain better ANN \noutput. Data normalization affects the performance error\
    \ of parameter estimators \ntrained to predict the value of several variables\
    \ (Gnana Sheela and Deepa, 2013; \nSola and Sevilla, 1997). The attempt to implement\
    \ ANN without input normalization \nwould cause the data dot product, between\
    \ input data and weights, propagation to \nbe driven by the larger input cases.\
    \ Normalization provides the system with a \nrealizable manner to assign the right\
    \ weights to the input, based on the real merit \nof the input data and not just\
    \ its absolute size or unit of measurement (Badiru and \nSieger, 1998). \n \n\
    2.5.4.2 Learning phase \nThe learning process of ANNs is carried out by two processes\
    \ running \ncomplementary one to each other, the training and testing phases.\
    \ The learning \nprocess is a multivariable optimization problem which can involve\
    \ hundreds or \nthousands of variables (Martínez-Martínez et al., 2015). During\
    \ the learning phase, \nthe train and test sets are used to tune the model until\
    \ it reaches the wanted output \nprecision. \n52 \n \n \n \nThe training set is\
    \ the largest dataset, and it is used by the neural network \nto learn the patterns\
    \ present in the data. The testing set, ranging in size from 10% \nto 30% of the\
    \ training set, is used to evaluate the generalization ability of a \nsupposedly\
    \ trained network (Kaastra and Boyd, 1996). The data in the test set is \nused\
    \ to supervise the training process and avoid memorization or “overfitting”, in\
    \ \nother terms, giving good outcomes only for trained data (Dündar and Şahin,\
    \ 2013). \nHence, the training phase can be stopped at the point where the network\
    \ has the \nsmallest testing error; if the testing error starts to increase while\
    \ the training error \ndecreases, overfitting is taking place (Zhang and Morris,\
    \ 1998). \nThe “best” network on training and testing data is the network that\
    \ best \npasses the learning phase. However, its performance is finally qualified\
    \ in the \nvalidation data (Zhang et al., 2003). In other words, ANN must be trained,\
    \ tested, \nand subsequently validated (Belgrano et al., 2002; Patanaik et al.,\
    \ 2018). Several \nstudies use the test set as a validation set for the final\
    \ performance assessment of \nthe model, not in the testing phase rightly said\
    \ (Khashman, 2010; Trejo-Perea et al., \n2009; Yang et al., 2009). Other studies\
    \ do not use all datasets or the test or the \nvalidation dataset (Drucker et\
    \ al., 1993; Kong et al., 2016; Leu et al., 2001). This \nconfusion may be due\
    \ that ANN is a particular technique that needs these three \ndatasets, for train,\
    \ test and validate the model, meanwhile, for other predictions \nmethods, just\
    \ two datasets are usually demanded, a train and a test set (James et \nal., 2013).\
    \ \nIn the training phase, the mathematics behind the abstraction capability \n\
    of ANNs is called the learning algorithm. The most widely used learning algorithm\
    \ is \nthe backpropagation gradient descent, its popularity is presumably caused\
    \ by \nsimplicity, universality, and good availability in libraries (Phansalkar\
    \ and Sastry, \n1994; Tkáč and Verner, 2016). There are other learning algorithms\
    \ such as genetic \nalgorithms and particle swarm algorithms, these algorithms\
    \ are not as widely \nimplemented by machine learning libraries as the gradient\
    \ descent but still an \nalternative method to study (Rios and Sahinidis, 2013).\
    \ \nThe purpose of the backpropagation training is to iteratively change some\
    \ \nparameters of the neurons in a direction that minimizes the error, or as it\
    \ is defined, \nthe error function ― which basically performs the difference between\
    \ the desired \noutput and the actual outcome of the ANN across all the training\
    \ and testing \npatterns (Örkcü and Bal, 2011). The ANN has unknown parameters,\
    \ weights, and \nbias, just as the perceptron does, and these parameters are one\
    \ of the responsible \nfor the abstraction capability of the model. The objective\

    \ values for the unknown parameters of the weights and bias to make the model\
    \ \nfit the training data well. Usually, starting values for weights are chosen\
    \ to be \nrandom values near zero, for instance from “-1” to “1”. Hence the model\
    \ starts \nnearly linear and becomes nonlinear as the weights change (Cao et al.,\
    \ 2015; Hastie \net al., 2009). \nThe backpropagation procedure computes the gradient\
    \ of an objective \nfunction, the error function, concerning the weights and bias\
    \ of a multilayer stack \nof modules. The backpropagation is nothing more than\
    \ a practical application of the \nchain rule for derivatives, and it can be defined\
    \ by Eq. 10: \n\U0001D715\U0001D438\n\U0001D715\U0001D464\U0001D456\U0001D457\n\

    \U0001D456\U0001D457 is a certain weight of a certain synapsis. \n\U0001D466\U0001D456\
    \U0001D457 is a certain output of a neuron. \n\U0001D467\U0001D456\U0001D457 is\
    \ the product of the weight and a input variable. \n \nThe chain rule is applied\
    \ in functional dependence relationship ― when a \nfunction depends on other function.\
    \ For instance, the error function (\U0001D438) depends on \nthe output of a neuron\
    \ (\U0001D466̂), that at the same time depends on the product of the \ninput variables\
    \ (\U0001D467), making the link to the final parameter of this chain the weights\
    \ \nand bias (\U0001D464). The above equation describes the error gradient respect\
    \ a specific \nweight correction, but it is also valid for a particular bias value\
    \ since they are \nadjusted in the training phase in the same way. For the backpropagation,\
    \ all the \nindividual weights, bias, and errors are computed and added to obtain\
    \ the cost \nfunction gradient of the ANN and adjust the parameters according\
    \ to the calculus \n(Rosenbaum and Johnson, 1984). \nThe key insight is that the\
    \ derivative or gradient of the error function of \nANN can be computed by working\
    \ backward from the gradient concerning the \noutput layer to subsequent layers.\
    \ The output of the initial network model and \ncorresponding error is computed,\
    \ then, at each iteration, new weights and biases \nare determined to add or to\
    \ subtract a value to them, this value is called learning \nrate. Again, new outputs\
    \ and errors are determined, and if the new error is above \nthe previous one,\
    \ the new weights and biases are rejected, and the fixed value is \nagain added\
    \ or subtracted according to the gradient (Rusk, 2015; Singh et al., 2015). \n\
    54 \n \n \n \nTraining the network involves adjusting the connection weights to\
    \ \ncorrectly map the training set to obtain a desirable output, at least to within\
    \ some \ndefined error limit, it is basically an optimization problem (Palani\
    \ et al., 2008). In \neffect, the network learns from the training set; if the\
    \ training set is satisfactory and \nthe training algorithm is effective, the\
    \ network should then be able to correctly \nestimate the output even for the\
    \ inputs not belonging to the training set ― this \nphenomenon is termed as “generalization”\
    \ (Bishop, 1995; Punitha et al., 2013; \nWang et al., 2006). \nThe training phase\
    \ is a critical part of the use of neural networks. For a \ngiven problem, the\
    \ network training is supervised, given the fact that the target for \neach input\
    \ pattern is always known a priori. During the training process, the patterns\
    \ \nor examples are presented to the input layer of a network (Zhang et al., 1999).\
    \ With \nthe gradient descent backpropagation algorithm, a gradient descent search\
    \ is \nperformed ― it measures the output error and calculates the gradient of\
    \ the error \nby adjusting the weights in the descending gradient direction (Behrang\
    \ et al., 2010; \nSharma and K. Venugopalan, 2014). \nThe randomly generated weights\
    \ and the bias are adjusted by a magnitude \ncalled learning rate. The effectiveness\
    \ and convergence of the training algorithm \ndepend significantly on the value\
    \ of the learning step, the optimum value of the \nlearning step is system-dependent\
    \ and varies according to the problem and other \nANNs related features. For systems\
    \ that possess broad minima, a large learning rate \nvalue will result in a more\
    \ rapid convergence. Meanwhile, in a system with a narrow \nminimum, a small learning\
    \ rate value is more suitable. There are no general rules to \nobtain an optimal\
    \ learning step; typically used values are 0.9, 0.25, and 0.05 (Rui and \nEl-Keib,\
    \ 1995). \nRandomly initialized weights achieve much faster learning speeds; that\
    \ is \nwhy the weights and bias are usually randomly generated by the computer\
    \ (Cao et \nal., 2018). The backpropagation gradient descent is the rule by which\
    \ the weights \nare modified, the reason why it is called the stochastic descent\
    \ method is that the \nmodifications are performed in an “a priori unknown” sets\
    \ of weights and bias \n(Amari, 1993). The backpropagation algorithm is one of\
    \ the most powerful \nsupervised learning algorithms but if it is not well employed,\
    \ the ANN will not \nconverge to the minimum error point or will fall into a local\
    \ minimum, not the global \nminimum (Figure 15) and the convergence speed can\
    \ be reduced (Bi et al., 2005; \nDing et al., 2011; Örkcü and Bal, 2011). \nTheoretical\
    \ Background \n \n55 \n \n \n \nOther strategies to ensure better performance\
    \ of the training algorithms \nare the stopping criteria and the dataset number.\
    \ The stopping criteria can involve \nstopping after a certain amount of runs\
    \ through all of the training data and also \nstopping when the total target error\
    \ reaches some low level, for example, less than \n2% during the learning phase\
    \ (Palani et al., 2008). Monitoring the error in the train \nand the test sets\
    \ is also a good strategy for early stopping; if the testing error starts \nto\
    \ increase in comparison to the training error, early stopping the training prevent\
    \ \nthe overfitting (Tetko et al., 1995; Zhang and Morris, 1998). \n \nFigure\
    \ 15. Example of the error function with respect to the weight gradient during\
    \ \nthe backpropagation algorithm execution. \n \nRegarding the number of samples\
    \ in the datasets, generally speaking, a \nlarge number of input samples is necessary\
    \ to avoid overfitting (Ramachandran et \nal., 2015; Wang et al., 2006; Yosinski\
    \ et al., 2014). There is not a recommended fixed \nnumber of training samples,\
    \ there is a direct relation between large datasets and \nproper learning levels\
    \ of ANNs (Kourou et al., 2015; Krizhevsky et al., 2012), a good \nindicator can\
    \ be that the number of training samples should be larger than the \nnumber of\
    \ hidden neurons or neurons in the hidden layers (Huang et al., 2004). \nPerforming\
    \ proper training is a key for the ANN; avoiding the overfitting of \nthe network\
    \ is crucial for that purpose. Overfitting affects the generalization \ncapability\
    \ of ANN, and thus affects the prediction accuracy (Tian, 2012), and in the \n\
    other hand, early stopping is better in terms of performance-to-cost ratio than\
    \ \nError \nWeight gradient \ncurrent (\U0001D464\U0001D456\U0001D457) \nideal\

    \ \n \nconventional stop mechanisms (Iyer and Rhinehart, 2000). The number of\
    \ samples \nin the dataset, early stopping by reaching a certain number of iterations,\
    \ error \ntolerance on the training set, and monitoring the testing error should\
    \ be considered \ntogether to overcome the overfitting problem and not in isolation\
    \ (Chen et al., \n2005). \n \n2.5.4.3 Validation phase \nAfter the training phase\
    \ has been finalized, ANN performance is evaluated \nover the validation set (Ahmadi,\
    \ 2011; Altinay et al., 1997; Jafar et al., 2010). The \nvalidation set must be\
    \ composed by samples not included in the learning phase, i.e., \ninto the train\
    \ and test sets, for appropriate model evaluation (Basma and Kallas, \n2004; Tian,\
    \ 2012). In terms of the proportion of data needed for each dataset, the \ndivision\
    \ into three parts follows the following relation: 70% for the learning process,\
    \ \n15% for test phase and 15% for validation phase (Bal and Buyle-Bodin, 2013),\
    \ or \n50%, 25%, 25% respectively, can be also an alternative (El Tabach et al.,\
    \ 2007) as \nmuch as other proportions in similar ranges. \nThe lack of fit between\
    \ the observed phenomena, the real values, and \nestimated values by the ANN during\
    \ the validation phase indicates that the model \nshould be re-trained, with the\
    \ proper learning procedure and probably with more \nmassive datasets to ensure\
    \ more accurate results (Palani et al., 2008; Yang et al., \n2009). The cost function,\
    \ the error algorithm, is used to measure the model \naccuracy, and it is one\
    \ crucial algorithm to the network development. \nIn ANNs, the most used cost\
    \ functions are mean square error (MSE), root \nmean square error (RMSE), mean\
    \ absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage \nerror (MAPE), and cross-entropy\
    \ (CE), among others. These functions can be used \nduring the learning and the\
    \ validation phases, meanwhile, functions such as \ncorrelation coefficient (R)\
    \ and determination coefficient (R2) are most appropriate \nexclusively for the\
    \ validation phase (Ali et al., 2017; Ay and Kişi, 2017; Cheng et al., \n2018;\
    \ Moghaddam et al., 2016; Sarkar and Pandey, 2015). \nThe MSE algorithm (Eq. 11)\
    \ is generally selected because of its excellent \nperformance, relative to the\
    \ backpropagation algorithm (Zanetti et al., 2007) and it \nis one the most popular\
    \ cost function in ANNs (Adya and Collopy, 1998). MSE \nfunction appeals to be\
    \ adequate when dealing with a single variable in a study, since \nTheoretical\
    \ Background \n \n57 \n \n \n \nusing multiple variables and dimensions for each\
    \ one make the error comparison \nmore difficult (Köksoy, 2006). \n\U0001D440\U0001D446\

    \ of the ANN. The same symbology will be applied to the \nremaining equations\
    \ of this section. \nThe RMSE is calculated easily, in the same manner than MSE,\
    \ and then \ntaking the square root of the same (Eq. 12). The RMSE hence summarizes\
    \ the overall \nerror of the model, i.e., the precision of the model (Aptula et\
    \ al., 2005); the main \ndifference between MSE and RMSE is that the RMSE is most\
    \ useful when large errors \nare particularly undesirable (Saigal and Mehrotra,\
    \ 2012) and the small errors tend \nto be less penalized. \n\U0001D445\U0001D440\

    \ appealing measure. The MAE \npenalizes under and over-prediction respecting\
    \ to the actual outcome and is the \nmost natural measure of average error magnitude,\
    \ is an unambiguous measure of \naverage error magnitude and useful for inter-comparisons\
    \ of model performance \nwith different magnitudes and measure units (Willmott\
    \ and Matsuura, 2005). \nWhile the MAE gives the same weight to all errors, the\
    \ RMSE penalizes \nvariance ― as it provides errors with larger absolute values\
    \ more overall weight than \nerrors with smaller absolute values. When both metrics\
    \ are calculated, the RMSE is, \nby definition, never lower than the MAE (Chai\
    \ and Draxler, 2014). \n\U0001D440\U0001D434\U0001D438 = 1\n\U0001D45B ∑|\U0001D466\

    \ a term-by-term comparison of the relative error in the \nprediction concerning\
    \ the actual value of the variable. Consequently, the MAPE is \nan unbiased statistic\
    \ to measure the predictive capability of models (Wang et al., \n2009). MAPE is\
    \ often used because of its intuitive interpretation in terms of relative \n58\
    \ \n \n \n \nerror, but just viable when the quantity to predict is above zero\
    \ (de Myttenaere et \nal., 2016); otherwise, a zero division is produced, and\

    \ this error method reflects the similarity \nbetween variables from the perspective\
    \ of probability (Men et al., 2016). This cost \nfunction (Eq. 15) is frequently\
    \ with ANN with softmax activation function in the \noutput layer (Dahl et al.,\
    \ 2013; Liew et al., 2016; Maas et al., 2013). \nCE has significant advantages\
    \ over other error functions for probabilities \nproblems, performs better on\
    \ large and small target values because they tend to \nresult in similar relative\
    \ errors for both cases. The CE function performs better at \nestimating low posterior\
    \ probabilities than squared-error functions (Kline and \nBerardi, 2005). The\
    \ output of the softmax layer returns a series of probabilities, zero \nor positive\
    \ values, and the CE penalizes all the results which do not match the \ncurrent\
    \ probability of the target. \n\U0001D436\U0001D438 = − ∑ \U0001D466\U0001D456\

    \ functions reviewed so far are eligible for both the learning and \nthe validation\
    \ phases. Nonetheless, some algorithms are exclusively used for \nvalidation of\
    \ the model, such as the R and R2. The R, as is shown in Eq. 16, \ninvestigates\
    \ the degree of association between two variables, that is, it defines how \n\
    much a given relationship is fitted by a straight line (Tripepi et al., 2008).\

    \ regarding the microalgae production and management by \nusing an ANN and light\

    \ the microalgae species contaminating the cultures. The \nremaining subsections\
    \ are organized as follows: microalgae species and growth \nconditions for the\
    \ experiments (section 3.1.1), light absorption measure of \nmonoalgal and mixed\
    \ algal cultures (section 3.1.2), and the ANN used to elucidate \nthe microalgae\
    \ suspensions (section 3.1.3). \n \n3.1.1 Microalgae species and growth conditions\
    \ \nThe microalgae Nostoc sp., Scenedesmus almeriensis, Spirulina platensis \n\
    and Chlorella vulgaris were obtained from the culture collection of “Las Palmerillas”\
    \ \nResearch Center (Almería, Spain) (Figure 17). These species were selected\
    \ because \nthey include two fast-growing green microalgae — Chlorella vulgaris\
    \ and \nScenedesmus almeriensis, and two distinct cyanobacteria — Nostoc sp. and\
    \ Spirulina \nplatensis; therefore, they cover a wide range of possible microalgae\
    \ species. \n \nFigure 17. Microalgae cultures collection of “Las Palmerillas”\

    \ under \nlaboratory conditions in 2 L bubble-column photobioreactors at an irradiance\
    \ of 750 \nμE·m-2·s−1, adapting the described methodology (Gómez et al., 2013).\
    \ Arnon \nmedium was used for the four microalgae, although in the case of S.\
    \ platensis, it was \nenriched with 16 g·L-1 of sodium bicarbonate. The temperature\

    \ To perform the absorption measurements, samples from the reactors were \ncollected\
    \ and placed in batch mode inside 0.2 L flasks for ten days, with no CO2 \ninjection\
    \ and at an irradiance of 250 μE·m-2·s−1 to simulate variations in pigments \n\
    and composition that can be found in batch cultures of each of the selected \n\
    microalgae. \n \n3.1.2 Light absorption measurements \nSamples of Nostoc sp.,\
    \ S. almeriensis, S. platensis and C. vulgaris were \ntaken from the reactors\
    \ over five consecutive days. Light absorption measurements \nwere performed on\
    \ the monoalgal cultures. Additionally, light absorption \nmeasurements were carried\
    \ out on paired cultures in proportions of 50%/50% and \n75%/25% (Figure 18a).\
    \ In total, 22 suspensions were prepared daily; these included \nboth monoalgal\
    \ and mixed algal cultures. Each suspension was measured 25 times. \nOver the\
    \ five days, a total of 550 samples were measured to obtain sufficient data \n\
    to train the ANN; the more significant the amount of data, the lower the model\
    \ error \nand the higher the accuracy of the developed ANN (Ying-Jin et al., 2004).\

    \ specific bandwidth, \U0001D44E\U0001D456 is the raw \nabsorbance in a bandwidth,\
    \ and ∑ \U0001D44E is the total light absorption of a microalga \nsuspension across\
    \ the spectrum. Consequently, the relative absorbance represents \nthe quantity\
    \ of light absorption in each bandwidth without the cell concentration \neffect.\
    \ \nFor ANN development, data were normalized in order to improve network \nperformance,\
    \ increase output accuracy, and reduce computational cost (Gnana \nSheela and\
    \ Deepa, 2013; Sola and Sevilla, 1997). The statistical, or Z-score, \nnormalization\
    \ technique as is shown in Eq. 8 was applied to the relative absorbance \ndata;\
    \ where \U0001D465\U0001D456 is the relative light absorption datum (for each\
    \ absorbance band per \nsample), \U0001D707 is the mean of the whole dataset,\
    \ \U0001D70E is the standard deviation and \U0001D467\U0001D456 is \nthe normalized\
    \ datum. \nThe ANN was a fully connected feed-forward neural network, \nprogrammed\
    \ in Python 3.6.5 language using the TensorFlow 1.8.0 machine learning \nlibrary.\
    \ After various configuration tests, the most straightforward structure ― with\
    \ \nless hidden layers and fewer neurons per hidden layers ― and the activation\
    \ \nfunction with the least training and testing errors was selected. Hence, the\
    \ neural \nnetwork architecture was 31 neurons in the input layer, one neuron\
    \ for each \nabsorbance datum acquired per sample, 45 neurons in the hidden layer\
    \ with the \nhyperbolic tangent activation function and 4 neurons in the output\
    \ layer with the \nsoftmax activation function to weight each microalgae species\
    \ in suspension; a \nschema is presented in Figure 19. \nThe optimizer was the\
    \ gradient descent algorithm with the CE cost \nfunction (Eq. 15); the CE was\
    \ calculated for all samples in each dataset, and the error \n\U0001D465\U0001D456\
    \ = \U0001D44E\U0001D456\n∑ \U0001D44E \nEq. 18 \nMaterials and Methods \n \n\
    67 \n \n \n \nwas expressed as average cross-entropy (ACE), dividing the sum of\
    \ CE by the number \nof cases in each set of data. In the training and testing\

    \ to prevent overfitting, was applied \nbefore the testing error started to increase\
    \ (Piotrowski and Napiorkowski, 2013). In \norder to validate the model, the ANN\
    \ output was analyzed by performing regression \nusing the expected microalgae\

    \ objective was to develop a tool for soil color \nclassification and analysis\
    \ in order to develop a fast and inexpensive tool for soil \nmanagement in agricultural\

    \ Study area and soil sampling procedure \nThe study area consisted in a 43.01\
    \ ha vineyard located between \n40⁰00'55.25'' and 40⁰01'24.99'' N to 2⁰56'55.05''\
    \ and 2⁰55'34.83'' W in Tarancón, \nprovince of Cuenca (Castilla La Mancha, Spain).\
    \ Previous mapping of apparent \nelectrical conductivity (ECa) was performed for\
    \ a representative soil sampling. The \nECa was measured with a Veris Q2800 at\
    \ depths of 36 and 90 cm in consecutive \nparallel paths with 10 m of separation\
    \ between lines throughout the parcel, the ECa \ntend to be useful to sort information\
    \ and identify sets of attributes with similar \ntrends (Officer et al., 2004).\
    \ \nThe obtained information, one raster file for each depth (Figure 21 a and\
    \ \nb), were reclassified using the Jenks natural breaks classification method\
    \ (Chen et \nal., 2013) ― 3 classes were defined in each raster. The intersection\
    \ of the classes in \nboth depths was used to create new segments, and each soil\
    \ sample was extracted \nfrom these new segments (Figure 21c). Hence, 174 sampling\
    \ points were defined, \n87 for each depth in order to get samples of each homogeneous\
    \ segment of the \nparcel. The soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory for\
    \ 13 parameters, such as \nthe OM and total nitrogen (N), expressed in percentage,\
    \ are measured using \ncombustion autoanalyzer LECO TruSpec; phosphorous (P),\
    \ potassium (K), calcium \n(Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese\
    \ (Mn), sodium (Na) and \naluminum (Al), are measured by ICP-OES after acid digestion\
    \ in nitric acid using \nmicrowave assisted digestion, and are expressed in mg/kg\
    \ of soil; pH and electrical \nconductivity (EC) were measured in water (1:5 w/v)\
    \ and are in dS/m. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n70 \n \n \n \nFigure 21. ECa\

    \ digital photos were taken with an image acquisition system consisted \nof a\
    \ Panasonic DMC-TZ70EG-S compact digital camera, with 12.1 Mpx, CMOS sensor \n\
    and Leica DC Vario Elmar 24 mm lens. The illumination set was arranged by a pair\
    \ of \n6,500 K professional photoshoot light sources to provide uniform illumination\
    \ to the \nsample (Mendoza et al., 2006) (Figure 22a). The image acquisition system\
    \ in \ncontrolled conditions is the most appropriate manner to take digital photographs,\
    \ \nunder non-controlled conditions the color can result less accurate and less\
    \ \nappropriate for this experiment (Lapins et al., 2013; Potočnik et al., 2015).\
    \ \nThe camera was mounted on a stand and remotely operated via the \n“Image App”\
    \ smartphone application (Figure 22b). The camera aperture speed was \nset at\
    \ 1/30s, ISO-80, luminosity f/3.3, and focal distance 4 mm. Soil samples were\
    \ \nplaced in Petri plates of 55 mm diameter, uniformly filled; 5 repetitions\
    \ (plates) per \nsoil sample were prepared, a total of 870 experimental units\
    \ were photographed. \nSoil samples were dried at ambient temperature to avoid\
    \ the interference of \nmoisture content in the soil color expression (Sánchez-Marañón\
    \ et al., 2007). \n \nFigure 22. Image acquisition system; light and camera setup\

    3.2.3 Computer vision software for color conversion \nIn order to accelerate the\
    \ process of color measurement of soil samples, a \nCV application has been programmed\
    \ to analyze the color in digital photographs and \nperform the conversion from\
    \ RGB system to the international standard CIELAB color \nsystem. The software\
    \ and user interface were developed in NI LabVIEW 2018 using \nthe Vision Module.\
    \ This programming environment has the versatility to work with \nscripts from\
    \ other programming languages, such as Python, and it is able to execute \nANN’s\
    \ scripts with the advantage that it allows designing a user interface which \n\
    enables the user to use an ANN without writing a single line of code. \nThe soil\
    \ color conversion from RGB to L*a*b* was performed using an ANN \nfollowing the\
    \ methodology proposed (León et al., 2006). To generate the model, the \n“X-Rite\
    \ ColorChecker Classic” (Figure 23) was used. This colorchecker includes 24 \n\
    color charts with natural, chromatic, and primaries colors in addition to a greyscale.\
    \ \nThe color charts are scientifically prepared and verified, see Appendix C\
    \ for technical \nspecs of the colorchecker. The RGB values from color chambers\
    \ in digital color \nphotographs were extracted and used as input in the ANN,\
    \ and the L*a*b* values \nprovided by the manufacturer were the output in the\
    \ training and testing phases. \n \nFigure 23. X-Rite ColorChecker Classic, color\
    \ calibration card. \n \nThe ANN was composed of 3 neurons in the input layer,\
    \ one for each RGB \ncolor element; 8 neurons in the hidden layer with the hyperbolic\
    \ tangent activation \nMaterials and Methods \n \n73 \n \n \n \nfunction; and\

    \ \nANN was programmed in Python 3.6.5 using TensorFlow 1.8 machine-learning \n\
    library. The obtained model was applied to convert the soil RGB dataset into L*a*b*\

    \ the Munsell color soil classification, a Munsell soil color charts \nbook was\
    \ photographed in the same image acquisition system described in section \n3.2.2.\
    \ A CV software was programmed in LabVIEW 2018 using the Vision Module to \nprocess\
    \ the color Chart Book and extract RGB median values of each notation color \n\
    in the book. \nThe RGB mean values of the 5 repetitions of each soil sample were\
    \ \ncomputed to compare them with the RGB obtained from each Munsell color \n\
    notation. The minimum Euclidean distance match algorithm was performed to \ncompare\
    \ the colors, as is shown in Eq. 19; where \U0001D445\U0001D460, \U0001D43A\U0001D460\
    \ and \U0001D435\U0001D460 are the mean of the \nRGB color values of the soil\
    \ samples and \U0001D445\U0001D440, \U0001D43A\U0001D440 and \U0001D435\U0001D440\
    \ are soil chart RGB color of \neach Munsell notation. Each mean of the RGB values\
    \ from the soil samples was \ncompared with the RGB values from the Munsell colors,\
    \ and the notation with the \nabsolute minimum difference was taken as the soil\
    \ Munsell color of the sample \n(Stanco et al., 2011). \n\U0001D451 = √(\U0001D445\

    \ dataset, outlier points were removed based on fertility \nparameters, the soil\
    \ samples classified according to their Munsell color notation \nwere analyzed\
    \ statistically; the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Levene tests were \nperformed, data\
    \ normality and equality of variances were discarded according to \nthe tests.\
    \ The means were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis H test to verify \ndifferences\
    \ between groups and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare \nthe groups\
    \ based on their Munsell hue color classification; all statistical tests were\
    \ \nperformed in R programing language version 3.4.4. \n \n3.2.5 Soil properties\
    \ characterization by artificial neural networks \nFor the ANN analysis, two datasets\
    \ were prepared with the soil color \nvalues, one for the RGB values and one for\
    \ the L*a*b* values, and the laboratory \nanalysis for soil fertility parameters.\
    \ Each dataset was used to train, test and validate \nANNs. The data were normalized\
    \ to improve the network performance (Gnana \nSheela and Deepa, 2013), the Z-score\
    \ normalization was applied to the datasets as \nMaterials and Methods \n \n75\
    \ \n \n \n \nis shown in Eq. 8; where \U0001D465\U0001D456 is the datum of the\

    \ deviation and \U0001D467\U0001D456 is the normalized datum. \nThe ANNs were\
    \ fully connected feed-forward neural networks, with the \nRMSE cost function,\
    \ programmed in Python 3.6.5 language using the TensorFlow \n1.8.0 machine learning\
    \ library. After various configuration attempts, the most \nstraightforward structure\
    \ ― with less hidden layers and fewer neurons per hidden \nlayers ― and the activation\
    \ function with the least training and testing errors was \nselected. The ANNs\
    \ structures were set with 3 neurons in the input layer, one \nneuron for each\
    \ color component; 1 hidden layer with 18 neurons, with hyperbolic \ntangent activation\
    \ function; 13 neurons in the output layer, one neuron for each soil \nproperty\
    \ to predict. For training and testing phases, 554 and 62 experimental units \n\
    were used, respectively. The validation phase was carried out with 25 soil samples\
    \ \nnot previously shown to the ANN in training or testing phases, the mean color\
    \ of the \n5 repetitions of each soil sample was used to make the 25 data to the\
    \ validation \ndataset. \n \n \n76 \n \n \n \n3.3 Virtual weather stations for\

    \ (FTP) server available; a Python script \nautomates the download of the data\
    \ by dates. The registers consisted of daily data \nsummaries of 53 meteorological\
    \ stations distributed throughout the territory of the \nautonomous community\
    \ of Castilla y León. The records date from July 1st, 2017 to \nJune 30th, 2018\
    \ to compile information for a whole year. \n \nFigure 26. Meteorological station\
    \ network of the InfoRiego program of the Agrarian \nTechnology Institute of Castilla\
    \ y León. \n \nThe meteorological observation records were grouped into a set\
    \ of daily \nprecipitation (Precip) in mm of rainfall, reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) in mm of \nwater, daily mean air temperature (Mean Temp), maximum registered\
    \ temperature \n(Max. Temp) and minimum registered temperature (Min. Temp) in\
    \ ⁰C, daily mean \nair relative humidity (Mean RH), maximum registered air relative\
    \ humidity (Max. RH) \n78 \n \n \n \nand minimum registered air relative humidity\
    \ (Min. RH) in percentage (%), mean \nwind speed (Mean WS) in m/s and total solar\
    \ irradiation (TSI) in MJ/m2 from all the \n53 weather stations. Additionally,\
    \ the UTM X and Y geographical coordinates, in \nETRS89 geodetic system, and the\
    \ Z coordinate of the meteorological stations were \nadded to the dataset to perform\
    \ the interpolations. \n \n3.3.2 Dataset statistical analysis \nAn exploratory\
    \ data analysis (EDA) was performed to the whole dataset, \nthe weather stations\
    \ with reading errors and the days with less than 90% of the \nwheater station\
    \ in the records were removed to ensure a minimum of observations \nper day. The\
    \ dataset resulted in 18,234 sets of observations from 355 days. A \nstatistical\
    \ summary was generated with the purpose of describing the behavior of \nthe studied\
    \ meteorological variables in the period from July 2017 to June 2018. In \nthe\
    \ same manner, data from the summer season months (July, August and \nSeptember)\
    \ and from the winter months (December, January and February) were \nfiltrated\
    \ to analyze the registers in periods with higher peaks phenomena such as \nhigh\
    \ or low temperatures, rainy periods and other seasonal meteorological events.\
    \ \nThe means of the meteorological events during summer months, winter \nmonths,\
    \ and the rest of the year were compared. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and \nLevene\
    \ tests were performed, data normality and equality of variances were \ndiscarded\
    \ according to the tests. The means were compared with non-parametric \ntests;\
    \ the Kruskal-Wallis H test to verify differences between groups and the Mann-\n\
    Whitney U test was used to compare the groups based on the season of occurrence;\
    \ \nall statistical analyses were performed in R programing language version 3.4.4.\
    \ \n \n3.3.3 Virtual weather station development \nThe VWS is composed of algorithms\
    \ capable of getting and processing data \nfrom weather station networks and predict\
    \ the possible meteorological state in a \ngiven location. For that, records from\
    \ the InfoRiego station network were massively \ndownloaded from the FTP server\
    \ of the ITACYL through a Python script and used to \ninterpolate values of daily\
    \ Precip (mm), ETo (mm), Mean Temp (⁰C), Max. Temp (⁰C), \nMin. Temp (⁰C), Mean\
    \ RH (%), Max. RH (%), Min. RH (%), Mean WS (m/s) and TSI \n(MJ/m2). \nMaterials\
    \ and Methods \n \n79 \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the quality of interpolated data,\
    \ a randomly selected weather \nstation was daily removed from the dataset, and\
    \ the results of the interpolations \nwere compared with the actual records from\
    \ these stations. The interpolations \nmethod approaches were through ANNs, deterministic\
    \ and statistical interpolations \nmethods, and random forest regression. All\
    \ the interpolation algorithms were \nevaluated with the same validation dataset,\
    \ and the accuracy was measured with \nthe R2 between meteorological observations\
    \ and interpolated values, and the RMSE. \nAll statistical tests were performed\
    \ in R programing language version 3.4.4. \n \n3.3.4 Interpolation methods \n\
    For the ANN approach in data interpolation, the performance of 5 ANNs \nwith different\
    \ activation functions such as hardlim, sigmoid, tanh, softsign and relu \nwere\
    \ programmed. The ANNs were multilayer perceptron, fully connected feed-\nforward\
    \ neural networks, with the RMSE cost function ― programmed in Python \n3.6.5\
    \ language using the TensorFlow 1.8.0 machine learning library. After several\
    \ \nattempts, the most straightforward structure ― with less hidden layers and\
    \ fewer \nneurons per hidden layers ― and with the least overall training and\
    \ testing errors \nwas selected. The ANNs structures were set with 2 neurons in\
    \ the input layer, one \nneuron for each geographical position coordinate (X and\
    \ Y); 1 hidden layer with 15 \nneurons; and 10 neurons in the output layer, one\
    \ neuron for each meteorological \nvariable to interpolate; using this protocol\
    \ for modeling, with the XY coordinates is \npossible to estimate the meteorological\
    \ observations. The Z geographical \ncoordinate was not used after verifying that\
    \ its inclusion leads to less accurate \nresults; selecting the appropriate input\
    \ variables is a crucial step in ANN modeling \n(López et al., 2005). \nThe dataset\
    \ was filtered by day to create a daily re-trained model to each \nof the 355\
    \ days of the study. The daily subset of meteorological observations was \ndivided\
    \ into a train, test and validation sets; a randomly selected weather station,\
    \ \nwith its own set of measurements, was separated for validation and the remaining\
    \ \nstations were used in the training and testing phases, with 10% of stations\
    \ reserved \nfor testing. The ANNs were re-trained and validated for interpolations\
    \ every day \nwith their datasets. The dataset with the XY geographical position\
    \ and the \nmeteorological observations were normalized to obtain better ANN performance\
    \ \n(Gnana Sheela and Deepa, 2013), the Z-score normalization was applied to the\
    \ \n80 \n \n \n \ndataset following the Eq. 8; where \U0001D465\U0001D456 is the\
    \ datum of the variable, \U0001D707 is the mean of \nthe variable, \U0001D70E\
    \ is its standard deviation and \U0001D467\U0001D456 is the normalized datum.\
    \ \nFor the alternative approaches, the following methods were applied; the \n\
    deterministic methods inverse distance weighted (IDW) and the inverse square \n\
    distance weighted (ISDW) were performed using the Eq. 20; the statistic method\
    \ \nmultiple linear regression (MRL); and another machine learning method, the\
    \ \nrandom forest regression (RFR) to contrast the ANNs performance. For the RFR,\
    \ the \nScikit-Learn (version 0.20) machine learning for Python was used, the\
    \ number of \ntrees or estimators were 15, the same train, test and validation\
    \ datasets used for \nthe ANNs were used for the RFR. For the deterministic and\
    \ statistic methods, the \ntrain and test sets were used to generate the models,\
    \ and the validation set remains \nfor the same aim. \nEq. 20, were \U0001D463\
    \U0001D456 is the known value; \U0001D451\U0001D45D is the distance to the point\
    \ to be \nestimated to the power of \U0001D45D = 1 for IDW and \U0001D45D = 2\
    \ for the ISDW; and \U0001D463̂ is the \nestimated value. \n \nAdditionally, all\

    \ the experiments are presented \nand discussed with relevance literature to contrast\
    \ these outcomes. The results will \nbe offered divided into three sections, one\
    \ for each of the main topic described in \nthe methodology. Regarding the first\
    \ topic, the microalgae suspensions light \nabsorbance spectral signature and\
    \ the ANN to elucidate the biology composition of \nmonoalgal and mixed algal\
    \ cultures are presented in section 4.1. The next topic of \nresearch, the color\
    \ analysis and fertility characterization of soils results are detailed \nin section\
    \ 4.2. Finally, concerning the third topic, the results and validation of the\
    \ \nVWS for meteorological data acquisition are exposed in section 4.3. \n \n\
    4.1 Monoalgal and mixed algal cultures discrimination by using \nartificial neural\
    \ network \nIn this section, the results of the ANN assay to elucidate microalgae\
    \ \ncultures are presented. The structure presented is the following: the microalgae\
    \ \nlight absorption spectral signature result (section 4.1.1), the ANN used and\
    \ its \ncapability to examine microalgae suspensions (section 4.1.2), and final\
    \ remarks \nabout the research topic (section 4.1.3). \n \n4.1.1 Microalgae light\
    \ absorption \nThe light absorption spectrum of a microalga is a function of the\
    \ biomass \nconcentration in the culture and the pigment content of the biomass.\
    \ The light \nabsorption spectrum measurement is presented in Figure 27 (left).\
    \ The results \nshowed that no substantial variations in the absorption spectrum\
    \ occurred for any \nof the microalgae over the time course measurements, the\
    \ slight variations \nobserved being due to differences in the biomass content\
    \ ― the higher the cell \ndensity, the greater the absorbance (Helena et al.,\
    \ 2011; Santos-Ballardo et al., \n2015). These variations were ruled out after\
    \ the absorbance was converted to the \nrelative absorbance for each measurement\
    \ (Eq. 18). \nWhen normalizing to relative absorption, the spectral signature\
    \ is a \nfunction of the pigment content; this varies depending on the algal species.\
    \ One can \n84 \n \n \n \nobserve how the lines overlap each other, thus making\
    \ the spectral signature of the \ndifferent microalgae used more comparable (Figure\
    \ 27 right). The results show that \neach microalga species had a unique spectral\
    \ signature: S. almeriensis and C. vulgaris \nhad similar spectral signatures\
    \ while Nostoc sp. and S. platensis had particular \nshapes that allow distinguishing\
    \ one from the other. In the case of Nostoc sp., slight \nvariations in spectral\
    \ signature were observed over time, especially on days 4 and 5. \nThis variation,\
    \ especially in the chlorophyll absorbance region, was not due to \nchanges in\
    \ environmental conditions because these were kept constant under \nlaboratory\
    \ conditions so that it might be related to changes in the cells’ biochemical\
    \ \ncomposition. \nNutrient supply and light conditions are two significant factors\
    \ that modify \nthe pigment content of a microalga species. Thus, the pigment\
    \ content is related to \nthe physiological status of the cells (Pancha et al.,\
    \ 2015). Furthermore, the growth-\ncycle phase also modifies the pigment content\
    \ (Lubián et al., 2000). Other pigment \ncontent variations are related to changes\
    \ in environmental and operational \nconditions (Pancha et al., 2014; Solovchenko\
    \ et al., 2013). Despite the difference in \ndays between sample measurements,\
    \ other factors remained constant, and the \nabsorption spectrum remained uniform.\
    \ Under different culture conditions, the \nspectral signature could present variations\
    \ within the same microalgae species \nacross the measurements. \nThe variation\
    \ in a microalga species’ spectral signature over time was \nminor compared to\
    \ the inter-species signature variation. Similar light absorption \nspectra, with\
    \ peaks at 450 nm and 680 nm, have been obtained for other \nmicroalgae, such\
    \ as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Isono et al., 2015), Thalassiosira \npseudonana\
    \ (Hewes, 2016) and C. vulgaris (Myers et al., 2013). Absorbance peaks \nare caused\
    \ by photosynthetic pigments. Thus, while chlorophylls present two \ndistinct\
    \ absorption maxima, one between 400 and 500 nm and the other between \n600 and\
    \ 700 nm, the maximum absorption for carotenoids can increase above 500 \nnm due\
    \ to spectral shifts caused by different contributing pigments (Holzinger et al.,\
    \ \n2016). \n \n \n \n \nResults and Discussion \n \n85 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 27.\

    \ Artificial neural network culture discrimination \nData from 550 samples were\
    \ measured to train and test the ANN. Once \nthe training and testing phases were\
    \ concluded, the obtained model was used to \ndetermine whether the validation\
    \ samples were monoalgal or mixed algal cultures. \nThe number of samples met\
    \ the requirement of having more training samples than \nhidden neuron units (Huang\
    \ et al., 2004). The final ACE during the training and \ntesting phases were 0.520\
    \ and 0.487, respectively. For the validation phase, the ACE \nwas 0.527. The\
    \ comparison between the experimental data and the ANN output is \nshown in Table\
    \ 1. \nMonoalgal cultures (S101 to S104) from the first validation experiment\
    \ day \nwere correctly identified by the ANN, providing results above 98% purity.\
    \ Regarding \nthe mixed algal samples, S105 and S106 correspond to not-previously-performed\
    \ \ncombinations; thus, they are “unknown combinations” for the model. Despite\
    \ this, \nthe model was capable of approximating the composition of these samples.\
    \ \nTherefore, these samples were close to the monoalgal cultures and the model\
    \ was \nable to identify the most abundant species and its relative proportion.\
    \ The ANN \nconsidered that small amounts of other species were also present in\
    \ these samples; \nnevertheless, it was always capable of identifying the most\
    \ prevalent species and \npercentage composition. \nRegarding the samples with\
    \ 50% of two different species (S107 and S108), \nthe artificial neural network\
    \ was, likewise, capable of approximating the \ncomposition of these mixed algal\
    \ samples, identifying the two predominant species \nand their approximate percentage.\
    \ In no case, these samples were identified as \nmonoalgal cultures. The same\
    \ validation protocol was repeated on the second day. \nIn this case, when using\
    \ monoalgal cultures (S201 to S204), the ANN provided results \nabove 99% purity\
    \ for these samples. \nFor samples containing 90-95% of one species and 10-5%\
    \ of another (S205 \nto S209), these samples were “unknown combinations” for the\
    \ model. Nonetheless, \nit was able to identify the predominant algal species\
    \ present in each sample, with \npercentages similar to monoalgal cultures. The\
    \ one exception was the 90% S. \nplatensis and 10% C. vulgaris sample, for which\
    \ an accurate estimate was given. \nSimilar mixed algal samples to those used\
    \ for the training process (S210 to S227) \nprovided better results, with none\
    \ of them being classified as monoalgal. The last \nsample (S228) also corresponded\
    \ to an “unknown combination” for the model, and \nit was, likewise, not classified\
    \ as monoalgal. \nResults and Discussion \n \n \n \n       87 \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ to these results, mixed algal samples with 10% or less \ncontamination were\
    \ weighted as monoalgal suspensions. Mixed algal samples \ncomposition were less\
    \ accurate predicted in relation to monoalgal suspensions. In a \nstudy using\
    \ flow cytometry with the SYTO9 stain, it was possible to classify C. \nvulgaris,\
    \ Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Navicula \npelliculosa,\
    \ with errors ranging from 5-10%. However, the method misidentified \nmicroalgae\
    \ cells in mixed algal samples (Peniuk et al., 2016). Given that \ncontamination\
    \ by non-target microalgae is a severe problem to microalgae \ncultivation (Wen\
    \ et al., 2016), our method could be a powerful alternative for \nsupervising\
    \ algal cultures. Additionally, the method can provide information about \nthe\
    \ relative composition of a sample, an advantage over traditional methods in \n\
    which more steps and time are needed to reach similar conclusions. \nThe ANN gives\
    \ the approximate composition of a sample based on data \ninput processing; each\
    \ absorbance bandwidth is weighted during the training phase. \nMonoalgal samples\
    \ composition were slightly under 100%, probably due to the \nmanner each absorbance\
    \ bandwidth influences the ANN output. For instance, in \nS102, a S. almeriensis\
    \ monoalgal sample, C. Vulgaris obtained a 1.30% prediction \ncompared to 98.70%\
    \ for S. almeriensis ― both microalgae species exhibited similar \nspectral signatures\
    \ (Figure 27 right). Furthermore, C. vulgaris was overestimated in \nmixed algal\
    \ samples, whereas S. platensis was underestimated (S110, S216 and \nS221). This\
    \ confusion may be due to the manner that the resulting spectral signature \n\
    bandwidths, in the mixed algal samples, are weighted by the ANN. \nTo better show\
    \ the accuracy of the developed ANN, a regression analysis \nof the experimental\
    \ and modeled values was performed (Figure 28). The results \nshow that, regardless\
    \ of the microalga species, the ANN fitted the experimental \nvalues, with the\
    \ R2 ranging from 0.951 to 0.970. \nMicroalgae identification using ANN has been\
    \ previously reported with \ntaxonomic accuracy of up to 99%, using micrographic\
    \ image analysis (Coltelli et al., \n2017), similar accuracy to that achieved\
    \ in the present study for monoalgal cultures. \nThe method reported here demonstrated\
    \ its efficiency in discriminating mixed algal \ncultures, whereas it was less\
    \ efficient when there were smaller percentages of \nanother species in the samples.\
    \ If the ANN output indicated 90% or less, there was \na high probability that\
    \ the examined sample was derived from a mixed algal culture; \nconversely, if\
    \ it was more than 90%, the culture should be examined to confirm that \nit was\
    \ monoalgal. Therefore, this decreases the number of chemical analyses \nrequired\
    \ to monitor the biological composition of microalgae cultures. \n90 \n \n \n\

    \ algal cultures in a wider \nvariety of relative composition or using a higher\
    \ spectral resolution could improve \nthe ANN precision. The re-training could\
    \ also be applied to incorporate more \nmicroalgae species into the model and\
    \ test the model capability to differentiate a \nmore significant number of microalgae.\
    \ Re-training is a relatively fast process and \ncan take anywhere between 5 minutes\
    \ to about 1 hour depending on the computer \nhardware, training the ANN in a\
    \ GPU is significantly faster than in a CPU only system \n(Ramachandran et al.,\
    \ 2015). \n \nResults and Discussion \n \n91 \n \n \n \n \n4.1.3 Final Remarks\
    \ \nA rapid methodology to elucidate microalgae species in suspensions has \n\
    been developed and validated. To do this, microalgae spectral signatures from\
    \ light \nabsorption measurements of different microalgae species were analyzed\
    \ through \nan ANN in order to describe and classify them. Four important species\
    \ were used: \nNostoc sp., Scenedesmus almeriensis, Spirulina platensis and Chlorella\
    \ vulgaris. \nAbsorbance from monoalgal and mixed algal cultures was the input\
    \ data for training, \ntesting and validating the ANN. The results show that the\
    \ ANN was capable of \ndistinguishing between monoalgal and mixed algal cultures,\
    \ identifying the \nmicroalgae species in the monoalgal cultures and providing\
    \ the approximate \ncomposition of mixed algal cultures. These results confirm\
    \ that the application of \nspectral signatures with ANN is a suitable method\
    \ for approximating the biological \ncomposition of microalgae cultures. \n \n\
    \ \n \n92 \n \n \n \n4.2 Artificial neural network for soil color analysis and\
    \ \ncharacterization \nIn this section, the soil characterization and color analysis\
    \ by ANNs results \nwill be detailed. The remaining subsections are organized\
    \ as follows: the computer \nsoftware developed for the color conversion from\
    \ RGB color system to L*a*b* color \nsystem (section 4.2.1), soil samples Munsell\
    \ color classification and description \nresults (section 4.2.2), the characterization\
    \ of soil fertility parameters through ANNs \n(section 4.2.3), and final remarks\
    \ about the research topic (section 4.2.4). \n \n4.2.1 Computer vision software\
    \ for color conversion \nThe DigiCIELAB is the CV software developed to perform\
    \ the soil color \nexperiments. Although the software was initially used for the\
    \ soil color analysis, it is \nable to analyze the color of distinct objects such\
    \ as fruits, plastic, color paints, and \nother objects. The DigiCIELAB was selected\
    \ by the University of Valladolid in the \n“Prometeo” program, 2017 edition, and\
    \ protected intellectually by the university in \nconsequence of the award (Appendix\
    \ B). \nColorimeters are the most commonly used instrument to perform color \n\
    measurements in scientific researches; however, this instrument has limitations\
    \ for \nassessing some materials, especially those with the irregular color surface\
    \ (Barbin et \nal., 2016; Girolami et al., 2013; Yam and Papadakis, 2004). A more\
    \ economical and \nversatile alternative was developed using CV and an ANN to\
    \ assess distinct types of \nsurfaces, including irregularly colored. This application\
    \ allows accelerating the \nprocess of color measurement through digital photographs\
    \ analysis and the RGB \ncolor system conversion to the L*a*b* system, to obtain\
    \ the CIELAB international \nstandard for color researches. The user interface\
    \ is shown in Figure 29. \nIn the main screen of the software, two options are\
    \ displayed; “Color \nCalibration” and “Colorimeter” as shown in Figure 29a and\
    \ Figure 29b respectively. \nThe “Color Calibration” option is used to generate\
    \ the model capable of converting \nRGB to L*a*b* with a specific camera in a\
    \ particular light condition. The \n“Colorimeter” option is used to perform the\
    \ color measurement of new \nphotographed samples. \nResults and Discussion \n\

    \ The software searches the \ncolorchecker, separates all the 24 color sub-frames\

    \ to measure the color of images in different \nscenarios ― different lighting\
    \ conditions and camera configuration, it is necessary \nto take a picture of\
    \ the colorchecker in each different scenario. Otherwise, errors in \nthe L*a*b*\
    \ color conversion will take place due to the differences caused by light \nvariations\
    \ (Tarlak et al., 2016; ten Bosch and Coops, 1995; Valous et al., 2009) and \n\
    cameras color acquisition (Ilie and Welch, 2005; Kim et al., 2012). The recommended\
    \ \ncolorchecker to use with the DigiCIELAB software is the “X-Rite ColorChecker\
    \ \nClassic” (Figure 23, Appendix C). \nIn the DigiCIELAB, the process to autodetect\
    \ the colorchecker and the \nsample to assess the color is similar. For the case,\
    \ the process to detect a soil sample \nin a Petri plate will be detailed below\
    \ as an example and the step results of this \nprocess are shown in Figure 31.\
    \  \n \nFigure 31. CV process to detect the object of study and ROI in the digital\
    \ photograph: \nOriginal image (a), hue plane extraction (b), binary image (c),\
    \ filled image (d), Petri \nplate detection (e), ROI for soil color extraction\
    \ in the image center (f). \n \nIn the first step, from the original image (Figure\
    \ 31a), the CV software \nperforms a hue plane extraction (Figure 31b), i.e.,\
    \ separate the hue plane from the \nsaturation and value planes of the HSV system.\
    \ Then, a binary image is obtained \n(Figure 31c) by thresholding the image and\
    \ leaving just the pixels of the object with \nvalues “1”; all other pixels, which\
    \ are mainly the background in the image, are set to \nf \ne \nd \nc \nb \na \n\
    96 \n \n \n \n“0”. The object is filled to eliminate inner “0” value pixels and\
    \ obtain the skull of the \nobject of interest (Figure 31d). Subsequently, the\
    \ borders are detected, and the \nPetri plate is located in the image (Figure\
    \ 31e). Finally, an ROI in the center of the \ndetected plate is set, and the\
    \ RGB values are extracted (Figure 31f). \nANNs present remarkable results for\
    \ color conversion from RGB to L*a*b* \ncolor (Afshari-Jouybari and Farahnaky,\
    \ 2011; León et al., 2006; Pedreschi et al., \n2006; Pothula et al., 2015). However,\
    \ no previous work was conducted with the \nobjective to make the color conversion\
    \ through ANN more user-friendly. Instead, all \nthe procedures from previous\
    \ works were manually performed, from the color \nextraction from colorchecker,\
    \ data pre-treatment, code and tunning the ANN, \nextract the color from objects\
    \ to assess and run the model; this activity is highly \ntime-consuming and not\
    \ at the hands of all users since code ANN is not one of the \nmost common skills\
    \ between researches. With the DigiCIELAB, the user does not \nneed to know about\
    \ code or ANN architectures and algorithms to be able to use this \ntool, performing\
    \ faster and reliable color assessments. \n \n4.2.2 Soil samples description and\
    \ color classification \nThe statistical summary of soil parameters is detailed\
    \ in Table 2. The data \nrange indicates that the parcel was not uniform in terms\
    \ of soil characteristics, \nconsidering the relatively small area of study. The\
    \ colors varied from light yellows to \ndark browns, going through different shades\
    \ of red with an amplitude of lightness \nlevels as the RGB and L*a*b* indicate.\
    \ \nVariables such as the OM went from 0.34 to 3.45%, with a mean of 1.58% \n\
    and a standard deviation of 0.71. The contents of N, pH and Al were more uniform\
    \ \nvariables in the dataset. Meanwhile, EC, Ca, Mg and Na presented wider ranges\
    \ and \nstandard deviations. \nThe Munsell system classification resulted in 34\
    \ color notations from 6 \nhues (Figure 32). The yellow-red hues (YR) represented\
    \ 74.32% of the soil samples, \nbeing the 10YR (30.00%) the most abundant among\
    \ them. In previous studies, \nsimilar results for soil Munsell color were obtained\
    \ in other regions of Spain, where \nYR was the prevailing hue; red soils are\
    \ typical in Mediterranean areas (Castañeda \nand Moret-Fernández, 2013; Torrent\

    \ diversity in soil parent \nmaterial, aspect, topography, vegetation and land\
    \ management (Ibáñez-Asensio et \nal., 2013). \nCorrelations between soil organic\
    \ components can be affected due to \nnature of the OM; soils with a high content\
    \ of more humified substances show lower \nlightness (L*) than soils in which\
    \ fulvic acids predominates upon the same content \nof SOC (Vodyanitskii and Kirillova,\
    \ 2016). In the same manner, there is a non-\nproportionality relationship between\
    \ the dark soil and the OM, for instance, when \nthe humus content exceeds 6%,\
    \ the soil color varies only slightly in comparison with \nsoil color variation\
    \ under this OM threshold (Valeeva et al., 2016). The organic \nsubstance present\
    \ in Fe-coated particles also neutralizes its effect on the soil color \n(Vodyanitskii\
    \ and Savichev, 2017). \nIn Figure 33a, it is observed how soils with similar\
    \ L* values had different \nOM content – twice as much in comparison; and a lighter\
    \ soil with more OM than a \ndarker soil as well. In such wise, the association\
    \ of higher OM content in darker soils \n(Castañeda and Moret-Fernández, 2013)\
    \ is not always in this line. Regarding the \niron, another standard assumption\
    \ is that red color is associated with this element \nin soils (Torrent et al.,\
    \ 2006; Vodyanitskii and Kirillova, 2016). However, the similar \nphenomena to\
    \ those that took place with OM were observed for iron (Figure 33b). \nThe color\
    \ caused by iron concentrations can also be masked by hydrologic \nconditions\
    \ and the weathering that can modify the iron color by changing the \noxidation\
    \ state (Maejima et al., 2000). \nIn a study of ANN and soil color to predict\
    \ 44 parameters, physical and \nchemical, in a national scale study (Aitkenhead\
    \ et al., 2013), higher R2 were found \n(in average 0.40 for predictions to the\
    \ RGB color system and 0.41 to the L*a*b* color \nsystem) compared to those obtained\
    \ here (in average 0.31 to the RGB and 0.28 to \nthe L*a*b*). In another study\
    \ of ANN, using Landsat-8 satellite images, clay and OM \nfor the prediction of\
    \ soil cation exchange capacity, the obtained R2 was 0.80. \nHowever, both studies\
    \ were not clear regarding the dataset used for the validation \nphase; training,\
    \ testing and validating, all three phases, must be performed to \ngenerate a\
    \ proper ANN model (de Oliviera et al., 2009), not using all phases can lead \n\
    to an “apparently good” result product of overfitting or reduced generalization\

    \ (Bagheri Bodaghabadi et al., 2016). The same authors working \nwith ANN for\
    \ interpolation and extrapolation of soil classes obtained results with \nerrors\
    \ of 30% for interpolations and 80% or higher for extrapolations in the \nvalidation\
    \ phases. \n \n4.2.4 Final remarks \nThe color is a widely studied attribute in\
    \ soils and it is routinely used as a \nparameter for soil description. In this\
    \ research, the soil color was analyzed to \ndeterminate its capability to group\
    \ soils according to levels of fertility parameters \nsuch as OM, N, P, K, Ca,\
    \ Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Na, Al, pH and EC and perform soil properties \ncharacterization\
    \ from color data. For that, soils samples were classified according to \nthe\
    \ Munsell color notation and the obtained hues were used for statistical analysis;\
    \ \nin addition, with the RGB and L*a*b* color, two ANNs were trained, tested\
    \ and \nvalidated to describe the soils. Soil aggrupation based on the Munsell\
    \ color hue \nresulted not efficient to separate samples according to fertility\
    \ levels of the studied \nvariables, and regarding the ANNs approach to describe\
    \ soils, the obtained models \nwere not capable of providing accurate results.\
    \ The experiments suggest that soil \ncolor does not contain enough information\
    \ to predict soil fertility parameters. \n \n \n \n104 \n \n \n \n4.3 Virtual\

    \ the statistical summary \nof the whole dataset was obtained (Table 5). During\
    \ the studied period (from July \n2017 to June 2018), 18,234 sets of observations\
    \ were recorded for the 53 \nmeteorological stations. The maximum registered precipitation\
    \ was 42.85 mm in a \nday; the mean was 1.24 mm per day during the period. The\
    \ mean ETo was 2.82 mm, \nwhich mean that the overall water balance is negative.\
    \ Temperatures were 11.01 ⁰C \non average, 42.97 ⁰C and -19.75 ⁰C for maximum\
    \ and minimum registered. RH was \n71.06 % on average, mean WS was 1.92 m/s2,\
    \ and mean TSI was 15.99 MJ/m2. \nTable 5. Statistical summary of meteorological\

    \ \n \n \n \n \nThe mean temperature was similar to the previously described in\
    \ the same \nregion (del Río et al., 2005), 11.17 ⁰C for a 37 years dataset (from\
    \ 1961 to 1997) in \ncomparisons with the 11.01 ⁰C obtained here in the 2017-2018\
    \ period. Regarding \nthe precipitations, the same authors postulated an average\
    \ of 664 mm for the same \nperiod, the average rainfall registered in the present\
    \ study was 441.12 mm, less than \nthe minimum of 480 mm registered in 1996 by\
    \ the authors in the driest year. In a \nstudy from 1981 to 2010 in Castilla y\

    106 \n \n \n \nThe average precipitation during the winter is more than twice\
    \ that in \nsummer, 1.29 mm and 0.50 mm respectively; in this location, the summer\
    \ is the \ndriest season and the rainiest season is autumn or winter, depending\
    \ on the specific \nsite. (Nafría et al., 2013). Other variables such as temperatures,\
    \ ETo, TSI are higher \nin summer; meanwhile, the RH is generally higher in winter\
    \ in concordance with \nprecipitations. The extreme temperatures, the minimum,\
    \ and maximum registered \nin the entire year occurred during these two seasons.\
    \ The standard deviation in \nthese two seasons are lower in comparison with those\
    \ seen in the whole year \nsummary (Table 5), the range measurements of the phenomena\
    \ were also narrow \nbecause of the uniformity of conditions during specific seasons\
    \ in contrast to ranges \nof an entire year. The general behavior of the variables\
    \ during the summer, winter, \nand the rest of the year is presented in Figure\
    \ 34. \nIt is observable that for ETo, temperatures, RH and TSI, more extreme\
    \ \nlectures were obtained during summer and winter. Meanwhile, the rest of the\
    \ year \npresented more intermedium values. The letters above the boxplots show\
    \ the \ndifferences between groups by the Mann-Whitney U test. The variations\
    \ of the \nmeans for precipitation, mean WS and max. RH in the periods were not\
    \ as notorious \nas the previously mentioned variables; nonetheless, the statistical\
    \ test found \nsignificant differences in these variables as well. \n \n4.3.2\
    \ Interpolation methods comparison \nDifferent ANN models as well other interpolation\
    \ methods were compared \nin terms results accuracy for meteorological variable\
    \ estimations. Generally, good \nagreement between the estimated values and the\
    \ actual records from the weather \nstations were observed for the interpolation\
    \ methods. Results from ANNs approach \nare shown in Table 7, and results from\
    \ alternative approaches are shown in Table 8. \nBetween the 5 activation functions\
    \ in the ANNs, the softsign had the \nhigher R2, 0.84, following by the sigmoid\
    \ and tanh with an R2 of 0.83, the relu with \nan R2 of 0.82 and the hardlim with\
    \ the lowest R2 result, 0.79. The mean and \nmaximum Temp were the most accurate\
    \ variable to predict, with R2 in the range \nfrom 0.96 to 0.98; following by\
    \ the ETo, TSI and minimum Temp with R2 higher than \n0.91. Lower R2 were obtained\
    \ for mean WS, maximum RH and Prep., with ranges \nfrom 0.43 to 0.75. In general\
    \ rule, the temperature is a more precise variable to \ninterpolate in comparison\
    \ to the precipitations (Jeffrey et al., 2001). \nResults and Discussion \n \n\

    \ the best \nperforming was the ISDW with an R2 of 0.84, following by the RFR\
    \ with an R2 of 0.83 \nand IDW and MLR with an R2 of 0.81. The mean and maximum\
    \ Temp were the most \naccurate variable to predict, as in the ANN approach, with\
    \ R2 in the range from 0.97 \nto 0.98; following by the ETo, TSI and minimum Temp\
    \ with R2 higher than 0.93. \nLower R2 were obtained for mean WS, maximum RH and\
    \ Prep., range from 0.48 to \n0.72. Although the performances of the methods were\
    \ similar, the ANN with \nsoftsign activation function and the ISDW were slightly\
    \ better considering the R2. \nHowever, the deterministic method had the lowest\
    \ RMSE, 2.72 in contrast to 2.82 \nof the machine learning method. \nIn a study\
    \ of daily rainfall interpolation with different spatial methods such \nas several\
    \ kriging variations, IDW and Thiessen polygons, the resulted RMSE were \nbetween\
    \ 9.7 to 12.3; been 10.1 for the IDW method  (Wagner et al., 2012) ― which \n\
    are higher than the registered in this assessment. Hourly interpolations of rainfall\
    \ \nseem to perform better, with R2 up to 0.75 using IDW, nearest neighbor and\
    \ kriging \n(Mendez and Calvo-Valverde, 2016). Another study with daily interpolations\
    \ of \nprecipitations and temperatures registered RMSE of 0.623 and 0.106 for\
    \ rainfalls \nand temperatures respectively using IDW (Berndt and Haberlandt,\
    \ 2018); these \nresults are better than the obtained, backed by the use of a\
    \ more significant number \nof weather stations up to 200 in 0.05 km2 in contrast\
    \ with 53 for 94.226 km2, an \noverwhelming disproportion. \nIn general, climate\
    \ and rainfall are highly nonlinear and complicated \nphenomena, which require\
    \ advanced computer modeling for an accurate prediction \n(Nayak et al., 2013).\
    \ Others studies used meteorological variables as inputs in ANNs \nto estimate\
    \ other meteorological variables. For instance, the ETo estimation with R \nof\
    \ 0.89 and RMSE of 2.77 using temperatures (minimum and maximum) and WS as \n\
    inputs in a period of 3 years (Falamarzi et al., 2014), the RMSE obtained for\
    \ the ETo \nin the current assay are lower for any interpolation method in comparison\
    \ to that \nwork. Using only the temperatures (minimum and maximum) to estimate\
    \ the ETo, \nthe obtained RMSE were in the range from 0.54 to 0.66 (Diamantopoulou\
    \ et al., \n2011), compared to 0.44 to 0.55 obtained here. Local estimation of\
    \ crop water \nrequirements with ANN can be as accurate as of the evapotranspiration\
    \ models \ncalculations (Abrishami et al., 2018). \nGlobal solar irradiation forecasting\
    \ with ANN using temperature, RH, and \ndates parameters (month, day and hour)\
    \ achieved an R2 of 0.99 and an RMSE of 0.17 \n(Hasni et al., 2012), this prediction\
    \ has more accuracy than the obtained here, using \nResults and Discussion \n\
    \ \n111 \n \n \n \n \nmore input data and historical data of site for the forecast.\
    \ More precision in \nmodels, including interpolations, could be achieved with\
    \ increasing amounts of \nobservation data (Valipour, 2016), in this case, increasing\
    \ the number of weather \nstations to have more input data for to generate the\
    \ models. \nThe ANN approach, except for the hardlim ANN, outperforms the MLR\
    \ \ninterpolation with higher R2 and lower RMSE. ANN outperforming MLR is a tendency\
    \ \nand have been reported previously in meteorological studies with wind speed\
    \ \nforecasting (Bilgili and Sahin, 2010), seasonal rain (Mekanik et al., 2013)\
    \ and ETo \nestimations (Laaboudi et al., 2012). \n \n4.3.3 Season effect in data\
    \ interpolation quality \nResults from summer season for the ANNs approach are\
    \ shown in Table 9, \nand for the alternative approaches are shown in Table 10.\
    \ Regarding the results \nfrom the winter season, for the ANNs approach are shown\
    \ in Table 11, and for the \nalternative approaches are shown in Table 12. \n\
    In comparison with the interpolations of an entire year, during summer \nand winter\
    \ seasons the accuracy for all interpolations methods was lower, R2 \npresented\
    \ values in an average of 0.76 and 0.71 respectively in contrast to 0.82 of \n\
    the overall year. The RMSE, on the contrary, exhibited a slightly higher average\
    \ value \nthroughout the year, 2.97, in comparison to 2.91 and 2.84 for summer\
    \ and winter \nrespectively. The higher RMSE could be due that this error measurement\
    \ penalizes \nthe peaks, which presented larger absolute values more weight than\
    \ errors with \nsmaller absolute values (Shao et al., 2014). \nIn a study of temperature\
    \ interpolations during the months of January and \nJuly, selected as representatives\
    \ of winter and summer months respectively; the \nprecision in terms of RMSE resulted\
    \ in values between 1.35 to 2.62 in January and \n1.20 to 3.47 in July for MLR\
    \ and kriging algorithms, been the lower RMSE to the MLR \nalgorithm (Wu and Li,\
    \ 2013). During the summer and the winter months, the \nintensities of meteorological\
    \ phenomena had more peaks and when modeling these \nnon-common events, are more\
    \ difficult to abstract and create models able to predict \nthese values in contrast\
    \ to periods with less extreme values. Forecast the peaks of \nintensity still\
    \ a tough task for models, including ANNs, since those peaks appear with \nlow\
    \ frequency (Nastos et al., 2013). \n112 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 9. Analysis\

    \ 2011), and heat \nwaves in summers (Luber and McGeehin, 2008; Meehl and Tebaldi,\

    \ according to the month \nand season of the year in which the predictions were\
    \ made, with higher errors in \nautumn and winter and lower in spring and summer\
    \ (Kemmoku et al., 1999). The \nestimation of TSI by ANN using Meteosat-9 images\
    \ as input was better in clear-\nperiods than rainy or overcast ones; the RMSE\
    \ was 21.20% against 5.13% for rainy \nand clear-sky days months respectively\
    \ (Linares-Rodriguez et al., 2013). \n \n4.3.4 Virtual weather station \nThe algorithms\
    \ composing the VWS are capable of access the InfoRiego \nFTP server, other servers\
    \ address can be configurable into the script in order to \naccess different FTP\
    \ servers or similar protocols. Once the access is done, the user \nperforms a\
    \ filtered selection of the files to download information of a specified \nperiod.\
    \ Thereupon, once the data is available in the user’s computer, the \ninterpolations\
    \ algorithms can be carried out executing the preferred one by the \nuser, introducing\
    \ as input the XY UTM coordinates in the ETRS89 geodetic system of \nthe weather\
    \ stations and paring this data with the station lectures. \nAccording to the\
    \ results, the most appropriate methods to perform the \ndata estimation thought\
    \ interpolations in a given location are the ISDW and the ANN \nwith the softsign\
    \ function. The interpolations can be made to any given coordinate \ninside Castilla\
    \ y León or other areas with a weather station network and accessible \ndata to\
    \ generate models. The innovative aspect of the VWS lies in the possibility of\
    \ \nthe user to choose a specific location, and estimated temperatures, RH, ETo,\
    \ \nprecipitations, TSI, WS with just one method, other studies of interpolations\
    \ are \nfocused just in a couple of variables using non-automated data access\
    \ and \nprocessing. \n \n4.3.5 Final Remarks \nMeteorological data is an important\
    \ series of observations for agricultural \nactivities. The data is generally\
    \ obtained from automatic weather stations; however, \nResult and Discussions\
    \ \n \n117 \n \n \n \n \nthe data can also be acquired from VWS. A VWS is an integration\
    \ of algorithms to \nestimated meteorological data from nearby weather stations\
    \ observations to other \nlocations with no available stations. To develop the\
    \ VWS, the performance of \ndifferent interpolation methods were evaluated to\
    \ test their accuracy. Daily data \nfrom an automatic weather station network\
    \ were used to perform the \ninterpolations. ANNs with the hardlim, sigmoid, tanh,\
    \ softsign and relu activations \nfunctions were employed, as well as IDW, ISDW,\
    \ MLR, and RFR to interpolate the \ndaily observations. \nAdditionally, interpolations\
    \ in the summer and winter months were \nperformed to check the capability of\
    \ the models during periods with more extreme \nphenomena registers. The results\
    \ showed that the interpolation methods have an \nR2 up to 0.98 for variables\
    \ such as temperatures for the period of one year. \nMeanwhile, during the summer\
    \ and winter, the models presented lower accuracy. \nFrom a practical perspective,\
    \ the methods here described can be an alternative to \nmeteorological data acquisition.\
    \ \n \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n121 \n \n \n \n5. Conclusions \nIn this thesis,\
    \ the application of ANN to solve distinct problems associated \nwith agricultural\
    \ activities were tested, in the microalgae production, soil fertility \nanalysis,\
    \ and meteorological variables acquisition.  In the present section,  the \ngeneral\
    \ conclusion (section 5.1) and the specific conclusions for each of the three\
    \ \nmain topics of research (sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4) will be detailed. Finally,\
    \ future \nresearch niches based on the obtained result will be proposed (section\
    \ 6). \n \n5.1 General conclusions \nWhile this thesis explores three different\
    \ topics ― microalgae, soil fertility, \nand meteorological data ― the ANN approach\
    \ to solving problems associated with \nthese subjects in the agricultural plane\
    \ is the common ground in which the present \nwork is substantiated. From the\
    \ experiments performed, the following general \nconclusions are proposed: \n\
    - Firstly, ANNs have proved to be a powerful tool to solve classifications, \n\
    estimations and predictions problems. The use of ANNs in agricultural related\
    \ \nissues is a critical step to find solutions for problems and help the users\
    \ of this \ntechnology to make faster and better decisions in the productive chain,\
    \ for \ninstance, in the monitoring of microalgae cultures and crop management.\
    \ By \ncontrast, ANNs are not always capable of mapping the input variables with\
    \ a \ntarget. In these cases, the network configuration must be rethought, dataset\
    \ size \nincreased and considered the fact that the input variables may not have\
    \ a \nrelation with the desired output. \n- Secondly, ANNs can perform and adapt\
    \ to multiple problems. There is \nnot strictly ANN architecture, activation function,\
    \ error measure technique, and \nother parameters to ensure the best performance.\
    \ Several models for each case \nwere evaluated, and the selected model was the\
    \ most accurate for the validation \nset; the dataset in which the model evaluation\
    \ must be performed to conclude \nthe inquiry. \n \n122 \n \n \n \n5.2 Monoalgal\
    \ and mixed algal cultures discrimination by using \nartificial neural network\
    \ conclusions \n- It was demonstrated that microalgae light absorption spectra\
    \ vary mainly \nas a function of the microalga species, although minor variations\
    \ due to \nenvironmental and operational conditions can also take place. \n- When\
    \ maintaining the cultures under similar conditions, the light \nabsorption spectra\
    \ can be used to develop an ANN that differentiates monoalgal \nfrom mixed algal\
    \ cultures and identifies the predominant species. In addition, it \nis useful\
    \ to be able to approximate the percentage of each species in mixed \ncultures.\
    \ \n- A major advantage of this method is that it does not require much time \n\
    or chemical analysis; a single light absorption spectrum is enough to quantify\
    \ the \nbiological composition of the cultures. It can provide a fast and powerful\
    \ tool for \nmicroalgae culture management at the commercial scales. \n \n5.3\
    \ Artificial neural network for soil color analysis and \ncharacterization conclusions\
    \ \n- Although the soil color classification is a frequently used technique in\
    \ the \ncurrent days and is it helpful for preliminary classification of soils;\
    \ in the present \nassessment, the color did not contain enough information to\
    \ classify soils \naccording to levels of fertility parameters. \n- The Munsell\
    \ color hues analysis was not able to separate heterogeneous \nsoil groups for\
    \ all the fertility variables studied. For N, Ca, Mg, pH and EC \nstatistical\
    \ difference were detected, but no differences between all hues for a \ngiven\
    \ variable. For the other eight fertility parameters (OM, P, K, Fe, Cu, Mn, Na\
    \ \nand Al), no significative difference was found between Munsell hues. \n- The\
    \ ANN approach to predict the fertility parameters in soils based on \nthe color\
    \ did provide an inaccurate model. The neural network was not able to \ngenerate\
    \ a consistent model from the soil samples due to the nature of the \ndataset;\
    \ soils samples did not exhibit a consistent pattern regarding the color and \n\
    fertility attributes, soils with similar color values drastically differed in\
    \ the fertility \nparameter and soils with different colors exhibited identical\
    \ fertility levels. \nConclusions \n \n123 \n \n \n \n \n5.4 Virtual weather stations\
    \ for meteorological data estimations \nconclusions \n- In the section, the concept\
    \ of VWS was introduced. The current state of \nthe weather station networks and\
    \ the online availability of the records makes \npossible to get the data and\
    \ process them to perform estimations of the \nmeteorological observations from\
    \ the measurements of weather stations to \nother locations with no stations.\
    \ \n- The overall performances of the interpolation methods were accurate to \n\
    estimate the meteorological variables; the ISDW and the ANN with the softsign\
    \ \nactivation functions were the most precise approach to perform the \ninterpolations\
    \ and to use in the VWS as preferred methods. \n- The occurrence of extreme meteorological\
    \ events, such as peaks of high \nand low temperatures or intense rainfalls, had\
    \ negative impacts on the accuracy \nof the interpolation models. Therefore, these\
    \ events should be considered in the \nmodel generation process. \n- The success\
    \ of the models suggests that they could be used in situations \nwhere no weather\
    \ stations are present, but meteorological data series is needed \nfor various\
    \ purposes, for instance, the register of the ETo and calculus of crop \nwater\
    \ requirements.  \n \nFUTURE WORK \n \n127 \n \n \n \n6. Future work \nTo conclude\
    \ this thesis, there are several aspects to consider as future \nwork that will\
    \ be highlighted in this section. As is usually appreciated in research, \nthe\
    \ experience raises more questions than answer. Everything since the \nimprovement\
    \ of the ANN algorithms to the extension or modification of the \nresearch approaches\
    \ or apply these techniques to other topics. In the paragraphs \nbelow, possible\
    \ research niches for each of the thesis topics will be presented. \nIn the microalgae\
    \ culture subject, the elucidation through ANN can be \ntested with more species\
    \ to expand the network capability to identify microalgae. \nIn the same manner,\
    \ more similar species in terms of spectral footprints, such as \nspecies of the\
    \ same genera or different strains of the same species, can be analyzed \nto test\
    \ the scope of the ML technique. \nRegarding the soil color and fertility analysis,\
    \ different predictor variables \nshould be studied since the color did not contain\
    \ enough information to create an \naccurate model. Spectrometry and vis-NIR can\
    \ be alternative approaches to try to \npredict fertility parameters with ANNs\
    \ seeking better accuracies. \nFor the VWS, more research is needed to amplify\
    \ the possible geographical \napplication of this technology. To determine the\
    \ appropriate minimum number of \nnearby weather stations to use as a source of\
    \ data, distance to the stations and the \neffects on the accuracy of the interpolation\
    \ and the inclusion of more \nmeteorological variables or interpolation methods\
    \ are some exciting possibilities. In \nterms of the accuracy of interpolations\
    \ during different seasons of the year, more \nstatistics techniques are necessary\
    \ to reduce the negative impact of these “outliers” \nphenomena registers in the\
    \ modeling process. Finally, the user interface for VWS \nbuilding is also a key\
    \ factor to bring this technology to more users, who do not \nnecessarily want\
    \ to interact with source code but can be interested in assays with \nthis technology.\
    \ \nANN applications are continually innovating in distinct disciplines of \n\
    science and agriculture should not be alien to all this revolution. The possibilities\
    \ are \ncountless; phenology of crops, varieties and cultivars, yield estimation,\
    \ pest models \nand pesticides application advisors, and machinery supervision\
    \ to cite some \nexamples. The improvements in this sector are crucial to maintaining\
    \ food \nproduction, convert agriculture to more sustainable, improve competitiveness,\
    \ and \nto minimize the effects of global warming. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n131\

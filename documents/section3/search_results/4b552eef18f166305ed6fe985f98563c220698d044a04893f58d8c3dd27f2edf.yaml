    related to the Internet of Things are widely diversified and require both low
    latency and the access of massive sensors to wireless sensor networks. In physical
    wireless parameter conversion sensor networks (PhyC-SN), a fusion center (FC)
    can recognize information from all sensors on the frequency spectrum of the received
    signals via conversion from sensor information to signal frequency. The higher
    resolution of sensor information of PhyC-SNs requires securing more frequency
    bandwidth. Therefore, spectrum sharing between PhyC-SNs and other systems is essential.
    For this study, we assume that primary systems (PSs) refer to other wireless systems
    and that secondary systems (SSs) refer to the PhyC-SN. The SS detects any access
    from the PS and immediately stops access to an FC. This results in a loss of sensor
    information. Thus, the accuracy of the gathered sensor information by an FC is
    degraded. This paper proposes an adaptive channel assignment based on two predictions;
    sensor information and channel occupancy rate. In the proposed method, the predicted
    error caused by the cessation of channel access is calculated and the assignment
    is constructed by minimizing this predicted error. Since the sensor can select
    channels in accordance with the error of an instantaneous sensor result, the proposed
    channel assignment can utilize awareness of the instantaneous sensor result. The
    proposed method achieves high accuracy of gathered sensor information while delivering
    less frequent sensor information to the FC, thereby improving the utilization
    efficiency of frequency channels. In the proposed double stage recognition for
    physical wireless parameter conversion sensor networks (PhyC-SN), a distribution
    of all the sensing information can be recogn...View more Published in: IEEE Access

    SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted increasing
    attention for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the status of computerized
    devices using the Internet, thereby realizing possible improvements in convenience,
    productivity, and energy efficiency [1]. The demands of the data transmission
    networks that support the IoT, known as Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), have
    thus greatly diversified over recent years. Fields of particular interest include;
    reducing maintenance costs via “life extension” [2], “low delays” for mechanical
    robot control and autonomous driving [3], [4], and a “high capacity” for gathering
    wide and diverse sensor information, such as the monitoring of crustal movement
    during earthquakes [5]. Since WSNs involve machine to machine (M2M) communication,
    the demand for WSNs is likely to become significantly enhanced as compared to
    conventional wireless communication, which involves human to machine communication.
    To achieve real time properties and a high capacity to access multiple sensors
    of WSNs, several wireless access schemes have been implemented. Frequency hopping
    methods [6] and the use of ultra-wide bands based on impulse radio time hopping
    [7] enable simultaneous wireless access based on spread spectrum technology. However,
    when the load from the simultaneous wireless access of sensors exceeds the spreading
    gain, the packet error rate rapidly degrades, which can drastically degrade communication
    quality. Methods involving multi-user, multi-input, multi-output [8] and non-orthogonal
    multiple access [9] technologies also enable the simultaneous wireless access
    of multi-antenna systems. However, such methods cause increases in delay times
    owing to the complicated processing required for separation of a signal. The present
    authors have proposed the use of Physical Wireless Parameter Conversion Sensor
    Networks (PhyC-SNs) as novel, real time information gathering systems [10]. A
    PhyC-SN converts sensor information to a carrier frequency in a manner similar
    to frequency shift keying. After all sensors in the network simultaneously access
    a single fusion center (FC), the FC detects the frequency spectra of the received
    signals using fast Fourier transform (FFT). In this case, the modulation signal
    sent by each sensor appears as a sharp spike in a spectrum at different frequencies,
    where the center frequency of the spectrum corresponds to the sensor information.
    Since distribution of the spectra coincides with that of all sensor information,
    the statistical information (such as the median value and the variance of the
    distribution) is instantly obtained. The processing delay in the demodulation
    at the FC is extremely short, as it simply consists of a one-time FFT and spectrum
    detection. After obtaining the statistics for all sensors, the FC can separate
    the signals by using a few features from each sensor as information sources. For
    example, we have proposed a method using the unique frequency offset of a sensor
    [11], [12], a method using the Kalman filter for capturing temporal correlations
    of sensor results [13], and a data separation method that regards the correlation
    of data as a shortest path problem [14]. A PhyC-SN determines the number of quantization
    levels for sensor information based on available bandwidth, meaning that the transmission
    of highly detailed sensor information requires expansion of the bandwidth. For
    such an expansion, the network utilizes a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) cognitive
    radio, which allows frequency sharing between different types of radio systems.
    For example, the 2.4GHz band uses WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE, and the Sub-GHz band,
    WiSUN and LPWA, share a frequency spectrum among heterogeneous wireless systems.
    To avoid interference with other systems, a listen before talk (LBT) access control
    is applied using a spectrum sensor. When access from another system is recognized,
    the external access of the main system is stopped, thereby avoiding interference
    with other systems. Hence, transmitting opportunities for the main system are
    somewhat limited when other systems frequently use the same channels. In the PhyC-SN,
    each quantization level of sensor information is assigned to a particular channel
    for modulation and demodulation. If any channels are frequently occupied by other
    systems, the quantization levels assigned to them frequently fail owing to the
    LBT access control. As a result, the accuracy of the statistics obtained from
    the aggregated results of all sensors is drastically degraded. Therefore, the
    construction of assignments between quantization levels and channels should include
    adaptation to channel occupancy caused by the other systems. In this paper, we
    propose using an adaptive construction to assign channels to quantization levels
    in PhyC-SNs by utilizing two predictions, sensor information and channel occupancy
    rate (COR). The first is that information from sensors that captures physical
    phenomena such as temperature, illuminance, humidity, vibrancy, location, and
    CO2 density has significant temporal and spatial correlation. We propose a probability
    model to estimate future sensor information derived from the aggregated results
    of past sensor information. As a result, an occurrence probability is obtained
    from the quantization levels of that sensor information. Second, we focus on the
    COR of each channel [15], which is the average frequency of use by other systems.
    The COR is given as the ratio of the entire spectrum sensor observation time to
    the time another system occupies a channel and can therefore indicate the probability
    that a channel will be occupied in the future. Using the two predicted values
    we construct a method of assigning channel and quantization levels based on cost
    optimization. We consider two types of cost: the successful probability of delivering
    (SPD) sensor information to the FC and the minimum mean square error (MMSE). For
    the cost associated with MMSE, the predicted error caused by the cessation of
    channel access is calculated and assignment is decided by minimizing this predicted
    error. Since the sensor can select a channel in accordance with the error of an
    instantaneous sensor result, the proposed channel assignment uses awareness of
    the instantaneous sensor result. This paper also considers double stage recognitions
    (online and offline processes) for an assignment optimization method. The online
    and offline processes estimate the statistics of all the sensor information and
    a future tendency for each sensor result. We consider two schemes for estimating
    COR: the use of specific spectrum sensors and crowd-sourced [16] consignment of
    other wireless systems. For computer simulation and experimental evaluation, the
    proposed PhyC-SN achieves the superior accuracy that aggregated sensor information
    brings, compared with conventional packet access based on frequency division multiple
    access (FDMA). Moreover, the method of assigning channels and quantization levels,
    which is constructed using the MMSE criterion, improves the accuracy of aggregated
    sensor information with a smaller SPD owing to the awareness of the instantaneous
    sensor result. Thus, it can improve the usage efficiency of frequency channels.
    The contribution of this study is as follows. First is the construction of a wireless
    sensor network with channel assignment based on the two predictions, sensor results,
    and an estimation of COR assisted by spectrum sensor and crowdsourcing. Second
    is the construction of channel assignment using recognition of the instantaneous
    sensor result. The third clarifies the advantage of the proposed channel assignment
    using computer simulation. The production of cognitive sensor networks and the
    optimization of channel assignment are provided in Section II. The assumed system
    model and details of the proposed channel assignment are provided in Section III.
    The simulation results are provided in Section IV. Section V concludes this paper.

    II. Related Works Various DSA schemes for WSNs have been considered using frequency
    spectrum sharing among heterogeneous wireless communication systems. Spectrum
    sharing causes the degradation of specific quality of service (QoS) criteria,
    such as the packet delivery rate (PDR), latency, and the accuracy of the aggregated
    sensor information [17]. Therefore, an important problem concerning spectrum sharing
    is how to improve the degraded QoS. In spectrum sharing among heterogeneous wireless
    communication systems, it is assumed that there are two priority classes in the
    access channel: Primary systems (PSs) and Secondary systems (SSs). In order to
    increase the number of simultaneous accessing nodes, both PSs and SSs simultaneously
    access the frequency spectrum without the degradation of QoS, which is referred
    to as an underlay DSA [18]. The co-channel interference (CCI) from the transmitters
    of the PS is derived using the theory of stochastic geometry and the optimal construction
    of transmission power control of the SS is constructed as in [19]. In an underlay
    type of DSA, the instantaneous CCI of the PS fluctuates significantly and is dependent
    of the PS traffic. A power margin [20] or a high-speed MAC protocol is required,
    which estimates the instantaneous CCI of the PS and controls the parameters of
    transmission power and wireless access. However, this causes excessive power consumption
    by the sensor nodes. In underlay DSA, the transmission power is too small to suppress
    interference to the PS and to maintain the large throughput required for QoS of
    the SS. When the SS can transmit a signal with enough power to satisfy the required
    QoS, it controls the selection of accessing channels or the access timing to a
    channel to avoid harmful interference to the PS, where the type of spectrum sharing
    is an overlay DSA. Various varieties of channel selection or resource allocation
    for overlay DSA of cognitive sensor networks have been considered so far [21].
    Reference [21] shows conventional studies for optimal channel assignment based
    on various kinds of criteria, such as energy efficiency, throughput, QoS, interference
    avoidance, fairness or priority, and the number of handoff events. For our proposed
    WSNs, the amount of information from sensors is constant and two aspects of quality
    are achieved; that is the real-time data collection for simultaneous access from
    all the sensors to the FC and avoiding interference to the PS. In addition, the
    accuracy of all the sensor results collected by the FC is adequately improved.
    Conventional studies consider maximization of the PDR for improving the accuracy
    of sensor results collected by FC. Random channel assignment to a sensor node
    in FDMA systems is proposed [22]. Since interference to the PS can be modeled
    using the stochastic process, the transmission power is controlled to ensure the
    suppression of interference to the PS. However, the optimization of channel assignment
    is not considered. Channel assignment based on spectrum usability for increasing
    PDR and reducing power consumption is proposed [23]. Carrier sensing is iteratively
    performed until an available channel is found and thus the delay for channel access
    is significant. Channel assignment with an awareness of the transmit waiting time
    of each sensor is proposed [24], but is only available under an unbalanced transmit
    waiting time among sensors. Channel assignment for increasing the efficiency of
    both energy and frequency spectrum usage with the securement of a specific PDR
    is proposed for the WSN via energy harvesting [25]. If channel access from the
    PS increases, the required PDR cannot be assured. Channel assignment using a successful
    rate of packet transmission based on the signal to noise power for minimizing
    late packet delivery is proposed [26]. This requires channel state information
    (CSI), but how to estimate CSI is not described. The optimal channel assignment
    subject to cumulative interference for maximizing the availability of a channel
    is considered [27]. In addition, channel assignment based on the COR of a PS assisted
    by a cloud server for maximizing the future availability of access channels is
    considered [28]. The conventional channel assignment for maximizing PDR is via
    assignment to an individual sensor node. In PhyC-SN, the channel assignment to
    the individual quantization level of a sensor result is constructed, and thus,
    each sensor changes the accessing channel in accordance with the importance of
    the instantaneous sensor result. Channel assignment by adaption to an instantaneous
    sensor result is referred to as channel assignment with information awareness.
    To our knowledge, channel assignment with information awareness has not yet been
    considered. Moreover, tendencies found using sensor information have recently
    been applied to WSN protocols to reduce power consumption and improve the accuracy
    of gathered sensor information. Coding schemes that include the temporal and spatial
    correlations of sensor information have been considered for improving both error
    rates [29] and the efficiency of collecting sensor information owing to the suppression
    of redundant data [30]. A sleep schedule using the temporal correlation of sensor
    information has been proposed for prolonging the life time of sensors [31]. For
    a multi-hop WSN, a clustering technique using the spatial correlation of sensor
    information is proposed in [32]–[34]. As the updating of clustering becomes less
    frequent, overhead signaling for rearranging clusters is reduced, achieving the
    prolongation of sensor nodes. In addition, the access schedule of sensor nodes
    based on the spatial correlation of sensor information is proposed in [35]. The
    improvement in the QoS achieved; more specifically the latency, the accuracy of
    gathered sensor information, and the power consumption of sensor nodes are all
    enhanced. However, the achievement of real-time information collection using sensors
    together with the construction of channel selection based on the tendencies of
    both sensor information and channel occupancy rates has not yet been considered.
    Thus, this paper utilizes a novel WSN for achieving real-time data collection
    and improving frequency usage efficiency under a frequency spectrum shared among
    heterogeneous wireless communication systems. SECTION III. System Model A. Overview
    of PHYC-SN Figure 1 shows an overview of the proposed PhyC-SN. The system is made
    up of single FC and multiple sensor nodes (nodes); each node sends detected sensor
    information to the FC. Hence, a star network topology is constructed, where j
    indicates the node number ( j∈{1,2,…,J} ) and J is the total number of nodes.
    FIGURE 1. Overview of PhyC-SN. Show All In each node, sensor information is converted
    into a discrete value using uniform quantization, where the delegated value of
    each quantized interval is referred to as a quantization level. We define x j,n
    ,n∈{1,2,…,N} as the n th quantization level of the j th node, where N is the total
    number of quantization levels. In the PhyC-SN, the quantization level is converted
    to subcarrier by inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). The PhyC-SN uses a conversion
    matrix W to determine the relationship between the quantization level and the
    subcarrier number. If n th quantization level is converted into k th subcarrier,
    the conversion matrix components of the k th line and n th column, W k,n , are
    set to 1, W k,n =1 . Otherwise, W k,n =0 . The conversion matrix has the following
    two conditions of constraint: (1) Each quantization level must be converted into
    a subcarrier. Therefore, ∑ K k=1 W k,n =1 is set, where K is the total number
    of subcarriers. (2) Each subcarrier is assigned to (at most) one quantization
    level. It is acceptable for a subcarrier to not be assigned to any quantization
    level. Therefore, ∑ N n=1 W k,n ≤1 , where N=K , the equal relation, ∑ N n=1 W
    k,n =1 , is set. As example, we set a conversion matrix with K lines and N columns.
    As a result, the above two constraint conditions are described as follows: W∈
    {0,1} K×N s.t. { ∑ K k=1 W k,n =1 ∑ N n=1 W k,n ≤1. (1) View Source where the
    matrix is referred to as a conversion matrix (CM). For sharing the conversion
    matrix, the FC broadcasts information pertaining to the CM to all nodes. If a
    n th quantization level is converted via subcarrier modulation, the node selects
    the n th column vector of the CM, W n =[ W 1,n , W 2,n ,…, W K,n ] ⊤ , after which
    it is fed into the IFFT. Following this, the node obtains the time domain signal
    of a subcarrier whose frequency corresponds to the n th quantization level. After
    frequency up-conversion, the sinusoidal wave of the carrier frequency plus the
    subcarrier frequency are sent to the FC. The FC broadcasts a request signal to
    all sensors and all nodes simultaneously send the resulting sinusoidal waves to
    the FC. Thus, the request signal sent by the FC is a trigger for the access channels
    of all nodes. After down conversion, the FC detects the frequency spectrum of
    the received signal by FFT. The sinusoidal wave sent by each node is detected
    in the narrow spectrum in the form of a spike [13]. Since the size of the IFFT
    used by the sensor is the same as that of the FFT used by the FC, the spectrum
    of received signal is resolved into the common spectrum components of the subcarrier.
    If the FC detects spectrum components above a certain threshold, it recognizes
    the subcarrier index of the detected spectrum components. Following this, the
    FC can recognize all sensor information via conversion from the recognized subcarrier
    indices to the quantization level of sensor information by the CM, W . As a result,
    the FC can recognize the statistical tendencies of the aggregated sensor information.
    The threshold for detecting spectrum components should be adjusted in order to
    avoid misdetection and false alarms [36]. The impacts of both false alarms and
    misdetection to the accuracy of aggregated sensor information are important topics
    for future work; thus, this paper assumes that neither situation has occurred
    due to use of a suitable threshold. In addition, the frequency offset caused by
    the frequency mismatch of local oscillators between the transmitter and receiver
    can cause errors in the recognition of sensor information and inter-carrier interferences
    [13]. Compensation techniques for frequency offset, such as multi-antenna schemes
    [13] and interference cancellation [11], [12], have been considered. This paper
    assumes that any frequency offset is negligible owing to these compensation techniques.
    Once the FC can estimate the median, deviation, and outliers of all sensor information
    from the detected spectrum components, various schemes for inserting the ID node
    into the transmitted signal are considered for specifying the information source
    of the individual sensor information. These include frequency hopping with ID
    specific sequences [37], fractional frequency offset with ID specification [11],
    [12], and multi-target tracking with periodically informing ID [14]. B. Spectrum
    Sharing Among PhyC-SN and Other Systems We assume that the PhyC-SN utilizes an
    LBT type of DSA such as WiFi, and that PS and SS refers to other systems and the
    PhyC-SN, respectively. PSs and SSs are located at random points over a specific
    area. In the PhyC-SN, a node detects the access of a PS via a spectrum sensor
    in a channel. When the node detects access, it stops accessing the channel; the
    channel bandwidth is identical to the subcarrier bandwidth defined by the FFT
    and the channel number is the same as the FFT index. As a result, the node cannot
    inform the FC about the sensor information. The availability of spectrum sensors
    for detecting PSs is defined by the circle model [38]. If a PS is located within
    the circle of a spectrum sensor, a SS can recognize the access of the PS; otherwise
    it cannot. We assume that interference from an SS to the PS within and without
    the circle of a spectrum sensor is large and small enough such that PS packet
    loss either occurs or does not occur, respectively. Therefore, the SS can avoid
    harmful interference to the PS within the circle of the spectrum sensor, as well
    as performing the spatial reuse of the channel accessed by the PS outside the
    circle of spectrum sensor. Error detections, false alarms, and misdetection have
    all occurred during spectrum sensing [36]. For suppressing error detections, the
    enhancements of spectrum sensing have been studied [39]. Since the impact of false
    alarms and misdetection to the sharing of spectra by the PhyC-SN is important
    for future work, we assume that this does not occur in this instance. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Channel Assignment The proposed method must predict the tendency
    of sensor information and the COR. Figure 2 shows the application of the proposed
    method for predicting two tendencies, referred to as double stage recognition.
    The two external sources for the prediction of COR are analyzed and detailed in
    section IV-B. The FC constructs the CM for determining assignment of quantization
    level and channel using the two tendencies. Following this the FC broadcasts information
    related to the CM of the request signal to all sensors. FIGURE 2. Double stage
    recognition for proposed channel assignment. Show All This section explains the
    prediction of the tendency of sensor information, the prediction of the COR with
    external sources, and the two types of CM construction methods. A. Double Stage
    Recognition Figure 2 shows the process flow of double stage recognition. In the
    first stage (online process), the FC recognizes the median, outlier, and deviation
    of all the sensor information using spectrum detection and the conversion from
    subcarrier index to sensor information. In the second stage, (offline process),
    the FC estimates the individual sensor information. Owing to the ID insertion
    [11], [37] and data tracking techniques [14], the FC can individuate all of the
    aggregated sensor information. In addition, the FC utilizes first in first out
    (FIFO) memories for recording the individual sensor information, where the number
    of memories are equal to the number of nodes. Techniques such as use of the Kalman
    filter [40], the autoregressive model (AR) [40], and use of the minimum mean square
    error (MMSE) [41] are used to predict the tendency of sensor information from
    previously recorded data. Owing to the predicted tendency of sensor information,
    the most likely value of sensor information and its deviation could be estimated
    by extrapolation. In mobile sensor networks for robotics, when information concerning
    spatial position is modeled using a random variable of Gaussian distribution,
    a highly accurate description of a robot’s position can be achieved [42]. A Kalman
    Filter can predict the sensor information modeled by a random variable of Gaussian
    distribution with high accuracy [43]. When sensor information is determined by
    numerous various incidents, sensor information can be modeled using a random variable
    of Gaussian distribution in accordance with a central limit theorem [44]. We assume
    that future sensor information is modeled using a Gaussian random model whose
    average and variance are given by the most likely value of sensor information
    and its deviation. When the mean and variance of the j th node’s Gaussian model
    are predicted as μ j and σ 2 j , the probability of the n th quantization level,
    x j,n , is given as: p j,n = = ∫ x j,n +Δ/2 x j,n −Δ/2 1 2 σ 2 j − − − √ e − (x−
    μ j ) 2 2 σ 2 j dx 1 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ erfc ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ x j,n −Δ/2− μ j 2 σ 2 j − − − √ ⎫
    ⎭ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ −erfc ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ x j,n +Δ/2− μ j 2 σ 2 j − − − √ ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ , (2)
    View Source where Δ is the quantizing interval and erfc( ⋅ ) is the complementary
    error function [45]. Thus, the FC could predict the occurrence probability of
    each quantization level for each node. B. Prediction of COR From the assumed sensitivity
    of a spectrum sensor in section III-B, it is possible to detect the wireless access
    of different PSs even if each sensor is located in a different place. Therefore,
    the CORs measured by each sensor are also different [38]. The wireless architecture
    of the sensor node is a narrow band transceiver designed to ensure low power consumption
    and the use of simple processing [18]. As a result, the accessing channels of
    nodes are limited. To obtain the COR for all the channels, the switching channels
    and COR measurements are iteratively performed. As many channels are defined in
    the PhyC-SN, measurements of the COR and switching channels are numerous. The
    required power consumption for measuring COR is excessive, therefore we consider
    two external sources for measuring COR; specific spectrum sensors, and crowd sourcing
    to increase energy efficiency. 1) Specific Spectrum Sensors A specific spectrum
    sensor has a solo function, which is the measurement of the COR. Figure 3 (a)
    shows the location and sensitivity of specific spectrum sensors. Each spectrum
    sensor measures the COR of all channels and informs the FC of both the measured
    COR and its positional information, where specific sensors can obtain position
    information via positioning systems (such as GPS). FIGURE 3. Image of position
    and sensor sensitivity of outsources for estimating COR. (a) Spectrum spectrum
    sensors. (b) Crowd sourcing. Show All Each node in the PhyC-SN also informs the
    FC of positional information, obtained via positioning systems. The FC considers
    the COR of the node as the COR of the nearest specific sensor to the node. Thus,
    the difference between the COR obtained with a specific sensor and that measured
    by the node occurs due to their different positions. As the number of specific
    sensors increases, the COR difference can be mitigated. In addition, since the
    specific sensors are systematically located, it can be mitigated rapidly as the
    number of sensors increases. The sensitivity of the spectrum sensors is switchable
    depending on their intended use and can be set to the same value as the PhyC-SN
    sensors. 2) Crowd Sourcing Scheme We assume that the other systems use spectrum
    awareness of cognitive radio for exploiting vacant channels. The COR information
    is useful for the PhyC-SN but not for the other systems. Therefore, exchanges
    regarding information concerning COR between PhyC-SNs and other systems is encouraged.
    If the other systems are crowded around a PhyC-SN, the PhyC-SN can gather comprehensive
    information about the COR [16]. We refer to the COR measurement by other systems
    as crowd sourcing. In crowd sourcing, the other systems inform the FC regarding
    the measured COR and positional information. The FC can presume the COR of the
    node as equal to that of the nearest other system to the node. Moreover, crowd
    sourcing is free from the cost of constructing and running spectrum sensors. Since
    the location of a spectrum sensor is not controlled, the spatial density of the
    sensors is not uniform. In addition, the sensitivity of each spectrum sensor is
    adjusted as each system exploits more channels [20]. Mismatches in position and
    sensitivity between the PhyC-SN and other systems occur. The former mismatch can
    be compensated for by increasing the number of systems, but the latter cannot.
    C. Optimal Construction of a Conversion Matrix After second stage recognition,
    the FC obtains two predictions: the probabilities of quantization levels in the
    sensor information and the COR. The FC constructs the CM, W , using a two-stage
    optimization system, the maximal successful probability of delivering sensor information,
    and the MMSE. 1) Maximal Successful Probability of Delivering Sensor Information
    (SPD) The j th node sends the n th quantization level to the FC by sinusoidal
    wave whose frequency is matched to the k th channel. Once this occurs, the SPD
    of the sensor information is p j,n (1− ρ j,k ) , where ρ j,k is the COR of the
    k th channel measured by j th node. Therefore, the CM, W , is constructed from
    the following maximization problem: max W ∑ k=1 K ∑ n=1 N W k,n ∑ j=1 J p j,n
    (1− ρ j,k ) Subject to ∑ k=1 K W k,n =1,  ∑ n=1 N W k,n ≤1. (3) (4) View Source
    This is known as the maximal flow problem. If K=N , the candidate solutions of
    this problem have O(N!) ; thus, it is an NP hard problem. This problem corresponds
    to the assignment problem1; doing so is known to result in the maximum matching
    problem for the bipartite graph and also in a minimum-cost flow problem that can
    be efficiently solved by using a Hungarian algorithm (also known as the Kuhn-Munkres
    algorithm [46], [47]). In the proposed method, we use an implementation of O(
    N 3 ) computational complexity shown in [48], which is based on the graph theory
    (the minimum-cost flow problem) [49], [50]. 2) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)
    When the j th node stops delivering the sensor information to the FC due to PS
    access, the FC ceases obtaining sensor information from the j th node. However,
    it can compensate by using the most likely sensor information value μ j , which
    is predicted using past sensor information. If the j th node tends to deliver
    the n th quantization level of sensor information to the FC, the square error
    between the true and compensated quantization levels is ( x j,n − μ j ) 2 . The
    probability that j th node will detect PS access through the k th channel using
    a spectrum sensor is ρ j,k . Therefore, the mean square error is given as: ( x
    j,n − μ j ) 2 p j,n ρ j,k . We construct the CM from the following MMSE: min W
    ∑ k=1 K ∑ n=1 N W k,n ∑ j=1 J ( x j,n − μ j ) 2  p j,n ρ j,k Subject to ∑ k=1
    K W k,n =1, ∑ n=1 N W k,n ≤1, (5) (6) View Source This is a known as the minimum
    cost flow problem, which is a linear programing problem. If K=N , the candidate
    solutions of this problem are O(N!) ; thus it is an NP hard problem. Since this
    optimization is also applied to the Hungarian algorithm [46], [47], we obtain
    the optimal weights under O( N 3 ) computational complexity. In the channel assignment
    based on the MMSE, each sensor can adaptively select a channel in accordance with
    the square error of the instantaneous sensor result from the prediction. Therefore,
    channel assignment based on the MMSE uses awareness of the instantaneous sensor
    results. SECTION V. Numerical Results We verify the efficacy of our proposed method
    by computer simulation. The computer simulation is based on the Monte Carlo Method
    [54] and it is constructed by MATLAB. For construction of the optimal channel
    assignment, we use open source software [48]. Table 3 shows the simulation parameters.
    TABLE 3 Simulation Parameters We assume a square field for location of the sensor
    nodes. The FC is located in the center of the square. The position of each sensor
    is decided using the two-dimensional random variable of uniform distribution.
    Moreover, we assume the number of channels, K , is equal to the number of quantization
    levels, N . The maximum and minimum quantization levels of sensor information
    are N/2 and −N/2+1 , respectively, using uniform quantization. We assume that
    the sensor information is modeled using a random walk before quantization. The
    original sensor information of the j th user in the i th sampling period, q (i)
    j , is given as follows: q (i) j = μ (i) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ + n (i) j , (7) View
    Source where μ (i) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ is a real value from sensor information and
    is given as follows. μ (i) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ μ (i−1) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ +δmod(i,5)=0 μ (i−1) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯   mod(i,5)≠0 (8)
    View Source where mod(a,b) computes a modulo b and δ is the uniform random variable
    taking either 1 or −1. The initial value of the original sensor information, μ
    (i=1) j , is modeled as the [−0.2N,0.2N] uniform random variable. n (i) j is an
    external force to the sensor and is modeled using the Gaussian random variable
    with 0 average and 10 − − √ deviation. During quantization, the j th sensor obtains
    the quantization level x j,n of the sensor information as follows: arg x j,n min
    ∀ n ( x j,n − q (i) j ) 2 (9) View Source After quantization, each sensor sent
    the quantization level of sensor information to the FC via the PhyC-SN. We define
    the training period for predicting the tendency of sensor information as equal
    to the memory size. We do not evaluate the accuracy of the aggregated information
    from sensors during the training period. After completing the training period,
    we evaluate the accuracy of the aggregated information. We assume that the bandwidth
    occupied by a PS is modeled by N PS channels as a PS is a more broadband system
    than an SS. When constructing the proposed CM, we use a Hungarian Algorithm [48].
    The FDMA is assumed to be a conventional access scheme. For the FDMA, the number
    of channels occupied by a node is set at 6 for fair comparison to the PhyC-SN,
    as the total number of quantization levels in the PhyC-SN is 64, which is equivalent
    to a 6-bit transmission. In addition, the FDMA uses a small order modulation scheme
    (similar to BPSK) to achieve the large propagation distance from the nodes to
    the FC. Thus, the data rates of the PhyC-SN and FDMA are common. The FDMA node
    continuously occupies 6 channels. As the total number of channels is 64, the number
    of nodes simultaneously accessing the FC is 10. Two powerful channel assignments
    for the FDMA have been proposed. For the first, the adaptive channel assignment
    of FDMA for maximizing a SPD has been proposed [27], [28], where the SPD is the
    ratio of the number of packets successfully sent to the fusion center to the total
    number of packets. For the second, a random assignment between each sensor and
    channel has been proposed [22]. In the performance evaluations, the indicators
    of the former and the latter assignments are “FDMA Pmax” and “FDMA Random”, respectively.
    When using the PhyC-SN, the performance of random assignments between quantization
    level and channel, the optimal conversion matrix constructed by maximizing the
    successful probability of delivering sensor information, and the optimal CM constructed
    by the MMSE are labeled “random”, “Pmax”, and “MMSE. ” For all four schemes, if
    the node does not deliver the sensor information to the FC via the channel occupied
    by a PS, the FC compensate by using the most likely value of sensor information
    predicted from previous data. To evaluate the accuracy of the aggregated sensor
    information, we use the root mean square error (RMSE) as follows: RMSE= E j,i
    ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ x (i) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ − μ (i) j ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ Δ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ 2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷     (10) View Source where x (i) j
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ is the quantization level of the j th user recognized by the FC
    in the i th time slot. The minimization of the RMSE value directly improve the
    recognition accuracy of the aggregated sensor information. If the RMSE = 1, the
    difference between the true sensor information and the gathered sensor information
    is equal to one quantization level Δ . In deciding the memory size for predicting
    the tendency of sensor information, we evaluate the average RMSE with various
    amounts of memory. Figure 4 shows the performance as indicated by the memory and
    the average RMSE, where we assume that all the sensor information has reached
    the FC without any access stop caused by the channel occupancy of a PS. From this
    figure, the convex tendency for size of memory is confirmed. This is because the
    tradeoff between mitigating the fluctuation of a sensor result and enhancing the
    tracking performance of sensor results is constructed for the amount of memory.
    The optimal memory for minimizing RMSE is from 30 samples to 75 samples and the
    average RMSE is not significantly different from this. Therefore, we use 50 samples
    as the memory size. FIGURE 4. Performances between Size of Memory and Average
    RMSE. Show All A. Specific Spectrum Sensors Figure 5 shows the RMSE of aggregated
    sensor information in a specific spectrum for estimation of the COR. “Ideal” in
    the horizontal axis indicates that the COR estimated by the spectrum sensor is
    perfectly matched to that estimated by the nodes. The area of sensor nodes is
    divided into small square grids and the specific sensor is then located on the
    center of each grid. Thus, the number of grids is equal to the number of specific
    sensors. Figure 6 shows the performance of the average SPD. FIGURE 5. Performances
    of Average RMSE (Specific Spectrum Sensors). Show All FIGURE 6. Performances of
    Average SPD (Specific Spectrum Sensor). Show All From figures 5 and 6, it can
    be seen that the RMSE and the SPD of FDMA are larger and smaller than those of
    the PhyC-SN, respectively. There are two reasons for the performance degradation
    of FDMA: the FDMA node occupies six times more channels than that of the PhyC-SN.
    When the PS accesses any channel occupied by the node, the node stops access to
    the FC. Therefore, the access of a node in FDMA is more frequently disturbed by
    the occupation of a channel by the PS. The second reason is the decreased freedom
    of channel selection. In the simultaneous access from all the nodes to the FC,
    almost all the channels are occupied. Although FDMA adaptively changes the assignment
    of a channel to each node under an ideal COR estimation, some nodes cannot avoid
    assignment to the channels highly frequently occupied by a PS. The PhyC-SN MMSE
    and PhyC-SN Pmax achieve the smallest and second smallest RMSE. In particular,
    PhyC-SN MMSE achieves a smaller RMSE than the quantization interval. From these
    results, we confirm the advantages of the construction of an adaptive CM in the
    context of both sensor information and the COR. In addition, it is worth noting
    that in Fig. 6, the SPD of PhyC-SN MMSE is 5% smaller than that of PhyC-SN Pmax.
    Since PhyC-SN MMSE achieves superior RMSE performance with utilization of fewer
    channels, it can improve the usage efficiency of frequency resources. The reasons
    for this improvement are as follows. In PhyC-SN MMSE, it is not necessary to deliver
    the quantization level corresponding to the predicted mean value of the sensor
    information. Instead, the quantization level with a greater difference from the
    predicted mean value and higher occurrence probability is delivered to the FC
    as often as possible. Owing to the awareness of the instantaneous sensor results,
    the channel assignment based on MMSE can suppress redundant sensor information
    as well as achieve better accuracy of gathered sensor results. As the number of
    specific spectrum sensors is greater than 64, we could not confirm large-scale
    improvement of the RMSE in PhyC-SN MMSE. Figure 7 shows the performance of the
    number of sensors and the mean square error (MSE) of an estimated COR from an
    ideal COR. From this figure, the performance of MSE is a monotone decreasing for
    the number of sensors because the location mismatch between the spectrum sensors
    and the sensor node is mitigated and thus the difference of an estimated COR is
    mitigated. In addition, as the number of sensors is larger than 64, the MSE of
    an estimated COR is smaller than 2⋅ 10 −2 . Therefore, the required MSE of the
    estimated COR is almost 2⋅ 10 −2 or smaller. In the assumed environment, we consider
    the number of required specific spectrum sensors to be larger than 64. FIGURE
    7. Performance between the number of sensors and the average MSE of the COR estimated
    by spectrum sensors. Show All B. Crowd Sourcing For crowd sourcing, the location
    of the other systems for measuring COR is modeled using the two-dimensional random
    valuables of uniform distribution. We assume that the sensitivity of a spectrum
    sensor in the other systems is identical to that of the PhyC-SN node. Figures
    8 and 9 show the performances of the RMSE and SPD and a number of other systems
    for measuring COR. As can be seen, the PhyC-SN MMSE achieves the minimum RMSE
    with a smaller SPD. Moreover, an improvement in frequency utilization is produced,
    even under the measurements of the crowd-sourced COR. Upon increasing the number
    of sensors, specific spectrum sensors converge slightly more rapidly to the RMSE
    than with crowd sourcing. This is because the specific spectrum sensors are located
    systematically, as the difference in distance between the node of PhyC-SN and
    a specific spectrum sensor decreases. This results in greater accuracy for estimating
    COR than with crowd sourcing. FIGURE 8. Performances of average RMSE in crowd
    sourcing. Show All FIGURE 9. Performance of average SPD (Crowd Sourcing). Show
    All Figure 10 shows the performances of RMSE and the number of spectrum sensors
    in crowd sourcing with different spectrum sensitivities. As described in section
    III-B, the sensitivity of spectrum sensor is modeled by a circle whose radius
    is defined by the maximal distance of PS access detection. We assume that the
    radius is modeled by the independent [ S d (1− Δ S d ), S d (1+ Δ S d ) ], uniformly
    distributed random variable, where S d and Δ S d are at the maximal distance of
    spectrum sensor from the node and the parameter for deciding the maximal difference
    of sensitivity is between the node and the spectrum sensor. FIGURE 10. Performances
    of average RMSE (Crowd sourcing with different sensitivity). Show All Figure 10
    shows the performance between RMSE and the number of sensors in crowd sourcing,
    where Δ S d are 0, 0.2, and 0.5. The improvement of RMSE is confirmed despite
    spectrum sensitivity differences. However, as the number of sensors is larger
    than 64 in Δ S d =0.5 , the RMSEs of both FDMA Pmax and PhyC-SN MMSE are not improved
    but saturated. Figure 11 shows the performance between the number of sensors and
    the MSE of estimated COR. From this figure, as the number of sensors is larger
    than 64 in Δ S d =0.5 , the MSE of the estimated COR is also not improved. Therefore,
    non-improvment in estimating COR directly decides the degradation of the RMSE
    of sensor information. The RMSE of FDMA Pmax is more significantly degraded than
    that of PhyC-SN MMSE because the number of channels occupied by FDMA is 6 times
    larger than that of PhyC-SN and the cumulative estimation error of COR among 6
    channels causes the degradation of channel assignment. Even in Δ S d =0.5 , the
    RMSE of PhyC-SN MMSE is smaller than 1 and thus a smaller estimation error than
    one quantization level is achieved. FIGURE 11. Performances between the number
    of spectrum sensors and average MSE of estimated COR (Crowd sourcing with different
    sensitivity). Show All C. Performance Evaluation With Actual Sensor Results For
    the proposed assignment, the accuracy of the prediction of sensor results decides
    the accuracy of collected sensor results in the fusion center. Evaluating the
    accuracy of prediction to the practical sensor result is important for clarifying
    the practicality of the proposed assignment. Figure 12 shows an overview of the
    performance evaluation composed of both the experimental environment and the computer
    simulation, where temperature sensors are used in the same evaluation system as
    Ref [12]. Temperature data is measured and recorded in the memory of each sensor.
    Following this, delivery of the measured sensor information to the FC by the WSN
    is performed via computer simulation. Therefore, we use the recorded temperature
    data as the test sensor result for use in the computer simulation. FIGURE 12.
    Overview of Experimental Evaluation and Computer Simulation. Show All Table 4
    shows the simulation parameters of the WSN. Figure 13 shows the measured temperature
    data as a base certainty regarding sensor information.2 We use a crowd sourcing
    scheme to measure COR, where the spectrum sensitivity in the nodes is equal to
    that in the crowd sourcing spectrum sensors. The measured temperature is added
    as the Gaussian noise, which is identical to that in eq. (7). The mean and variance
    of the Gaussian noise are 0 and 0.1. The dynamic range of the quantization level
    ranged from 0 to 51.2 degrees. The number of quantization levels was 256, which
    is equal to the number of channels. TABLE 4 Computer Simulation in Part 2 FIGURE
    13. Ground Truth of Sensor Information (Temperature). Show All Figures 14 and
    15 show the CDFs of RMSE and SPD. The RMSE of PhyC-SN MMSE is the best RMSE and
    it achieves almost 90% for a RMSE under 1.0. In SPD performance, the PhyC-SN Pmax
    achieves the best SPD, but a larger RMSE than the PhyC-SN MMSE. The former cannot
    select the suitable channel for sending the sensor result with a large square
    error to the FC. The SPDs of FDMA MMSE and FDMA Pmax are smaller than that of
    PhyC-SN MMSE and Pmax. As we explained, FDMA occupies more channels than PhyC-SN.
    Therefore, FDMA more frequently stops sending the sensor results. When the PhyC-SN
    MMSE is applied to the practical detected sensor results, a better RMSE and smaller
    SPD are achieved and thus better frequency usage efficiency can be accomplished.

    All SECTION VI. Conclusions This study implemented adaptive channel assignments
    for spectrum sharing among heterogeneous wireless systems in physical wireless
    parameter conversion sensor networks (PhyC-SN) under simultaneous wireless access
    from numerous sensors. In the proposed channel assignment method, the errors calculated
    from the predicted tendency of sensor information and predicted channel occupancy
    rate are minimized. The sensor adaptively selects the channel in accordance with
    the error from both the predicted sensor result and the actual one. Therefore,
    our proposed channel assignment uses an awareness of the instantaneous sensor
    results. From the computer simulation, the proposed channel assignment improves
    channel utilization efficiency. In future work, the performance of our proposed
    method should be analyzed during real-time application of the Internet of Things.

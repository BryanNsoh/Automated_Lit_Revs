    concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and
    its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and

    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    Bluetooth Low Energy SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will
    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture

    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    with its statistical and performance analysis. Comparison of performance parameters
    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.

    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\

    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\

    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    A rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture
    sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from
    conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization
    of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource
    optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations
    across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative
    projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry
    is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient
    scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities
    in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of
    the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also
    opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the
    recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development
    of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup''s
    started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision
    agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential,
    limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of
    IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article. A graphical

    term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’
    means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one
    of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various
    nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival
    and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted
    by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year
    2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of
    this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of
    70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is
    also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based
    fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations,
    the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution
    in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.
    Show All SECTION IV. Related Work The advancement and role of the Internet of
    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections. Various studies are performed and put forward by various
    academicians and authors concerning the evolution of agriculture relating to the
    incubation of the concepts of the Internet of Things. Kim et al. [64], reviewed
    different articles related to the induction of unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture.

    irrigation, insect, pest analysis were studied and discussed. Also, how this technology
    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An
    analytic study of various articles in the field of agriculture is presented, highlighting
    their most focused sections and gaps or areas not addressed. The sensors based
    on their field of application are also discussed. A systematic review of different
    articles focusing especially on crop monitoring, irrigation, disease detection,
    and farm management is offered. The articles considered for study range from the
    time frame of the year 2015 to 2020. From the studies, certain issues are put
    forward that demand research and experimentation in the future. Various existing
    public and private sector platforms or start-ups which work for precision farming
    are also presented and discussed with their specifications and applications. Making
    precision farming a base, a layout of an IoT based architecture is proposed. The
    communication technologies and the hardware platforms of IoT are also discussed.
    The applications of IoT in agriculture are also discussed. The issues, challenges,
    and future research directions are also highlighted. As a whole, the in-depth
    description of various aspects of IoT for agriculture has been discussed and how
    these studies should be catered in a way to create efficient and smart agricultural
    scenarios. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Limerick, Ireland SECTION I. Precision Agriculture
    Precision agriculture [4], [20], [3], [8], [10], [12], [19], [20], [24], [32],
    [34], [31], [33], [28], [30], [25], [27], [29], [26], [37] [38], [39], [40], is
    the area in which technology can be used to effectively manage agriculture by
    understanding the temporal and spatial changes in soil, crop, production, and
    management through innovative techniques. The emerging Information Age will significantly
    affect the way we conduct and teach precision agriculture in universities and
    institutes of higher education. These impacts of change are already being felt
    across disciplines and across their missions of education, research, and outreach.
    The vital role of computing and information technologies in precision agriculture
    reflects far-reaching changes across our society — changes that are impacting
    virtually every human endeavor in the field of agriculture. Due to this, in precision
    agriculture, there are great opportunities for discovery and innovation. There
    are also many challenges in accelerating pace of change and broadening needs of
    water for food. The community need to organize and harness its resources to effectively
    and efficiently overcome these challenges. At all strategic levels, integrated
    education, research, and outreach measures are required that address precision
    agriculture community’s need to acquire, manage, analyze, visualize, and utilize
    data and information to solve important cross-disciplinary problems and meet critical
    societal needs. By 2020, Cisco’s visual networking index [1] expects that 11.6
    billion devices will be connected to the Internet. This number is greater than
    the projected population of the World (10 billion by 2050). The data insights
    from these devices will carry a $11 trillion economic value. There is need of
    innovation in diverse set of precision agriculture areas. From an era where only
    tractors, seeders, combines, harvesters, and farm machinery were used with very
    limited technology, we are foreseeing a future in which computing and information
    technologies will be integral to every piece of equipment on the field. Growers
    will routinely use computers that are millions of times more powerful, connected
    to the Cloud with ubiquitous availability of data and information, and have communication
    capability through increasingly sophisticated interfaces. Many billions of data
    points are already being generated on daily basis at large agriculturally farms.
    Virtually every agricultural area has been profoundly impacted by advances in
    computing technologies [2]. On the other hand, our academic pursuits of agricultural
    education and research have not adopted to it. Our current generation agrarian
    students will participate in the innovations of the next fifty years and witness
    changes that we can only imagine. Perhaps no arena of computing calls more upon
    our imagination than that of systems that match or exceed the abilities of human
    intelligence to utilize massive and rapidly growing data and information resources,
    apply advanced analytics to extract information and understand patterns, and arrive
    at intelligent solutions or actions in highly dynamic situations. These technologies
    are now the stuff of science fiction personified in androids and even the singularity
    of humans and machines, but they will dramatically reshape education, business,
    agriculture, health care, science, engineering, humanities, arts, entertainment,
    and other activities in ways that we cannot yet envision. In Fig. 1, the different
    components of the precision agriculture have been shown. SECTION II. Practical
    Trends and Challenges We highlight some recent practical trends and the challenges.
    Agricultural industry, governmental agencies, and growers have exceedingly critical
    needs for skills and innovations in computing and information technology. Accordingly,
    demand for computer and information technology education and university research
    has increased over decades and has exploded in recent years. The Bureau of Labor
    Statistics (BLS) in U.S Department of Labor forecasts a 12% increase in employment
    opportunities in the field of computer and information technology with new jobs
    being added through 2024 due to Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Cloud
    Computing and Cyber Security. Precision agriculture is also one of the major research
    drivers and a leader in quest for innovation. As a result, the emergence of new
    business models, services, and markets and technological advances will also contribute
    to substantial growth in GDP. Lack of training is one of the main challenges to
    adoption of precision agriculture. Other factors hindering the precision agriculture
    adoption are cost, return on investment, and lack of precision agriculture big
    data analytics [16]. Fig. 1: The different components of the precision agriculture.
    Show All SECTION III. Objectives In this section, we present some important objectives
    for integrated technology research and education in precision agriculture. The
    establishment of stakeholder engagement programs to understand how industry leaders
    perceive the adoption of precision agriculture technologies is needed. Their understanding
    and vision about technology adoption in precision agriculture will aid in eliminating
    of barriers to precision agriculture adoption. Another approach to engage farmers
    is by providing access to high speed internet connectivity. The reliable inter-net
    connectivity at affordable price will improve adoption of precision agricultural
    technology. Furthermore, it will benefit on-site data analysis of yield limiting
    factors. Through high-speed broadband connectivity to the cloud, the traffic demands
    of the novel precision agriculture applications can be met. Despite the high costs
    associated with deployment of rural broadband networks, the internet service providers
    can reap higher returns on investment helped by ubiquitous precision agriculture
    adoption in rural areas. Our academic institutions must organize to more effectively
    perform the research driving innovations in precision agriculture to educate next
    generation students to use and creatively adapt both themselves and these new
    technologies for the future, and catalyze cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines
    bridging education and research. Innovations in precision agriculture training
    are needed. The development and implantation of training programs will help to
    strengthen the technology expertise the researchers need to deal with precision
    agriculture big data analytics. As new products will span out in various farms,
    the decision making systems should be available to stakeholders at various levels,
    increasing impact and providing a problem driven environment for learning. The
    enhancement of undergraduate curriculum to include technology solutions and opportunities
    in precision agriculture is also a current need. Particularly, development of
    training materials to offer education and outreach to farmers will help in the
    areas of sustainable agricultural management systems, sustainable agriculture
    l production and management. The improved MS and PhD curriculum for precision
    agriculture will lead to growth in expertise in precision agriculture. SECTION
    IV. Effective Approaches One approach is that the diverse departments in universities
    can expand and develop education, research activities tailored to their disciplinary
    demands. By leveraging collaboration and utilizing core resources, on-going education
    and research efforts can achieve a level of success and scale that would not be
    possible with only the personnel and resources within their respective departments.
    This structured cross-disciplinary approach will also be more cost-effective in
    leveraging resources and avoiding duplication and so will most effectively surmount
    the challenges in the field. Particularly, centers to catalyze and support collaborative
    research, education precision agriculture computational analytics and informatics,
    Internet of Things (IoT) among participating units across the departments need
    to established. Moreover, a signature constellation of undergraduate and graduate
    programs in precision agriculture computational analytics and informatics, rooted
    in participating department will play a vital role in sharing an innovative interdisciplinary
    core, and collaboration on visible, cross-disciplinary projects. Industry university
    cooperative research can be conducted by forming consortiums of industry and stakeholders
    across the country to leverage viable outcome. Through the application of state-of-the-art
    approaches and technologies, and leveraging existing infrastructure, including
    advanced phenotyping and genetics, new techniques can be developed to maximize
    yield and nutrition while conserving water resources [18], [17]. Development of
    testbeds and platforms to implement and test new precision agriculture technologies
    for monitoring, planting, and harvesting through farmer/academia engagement will
    aid in technology adoption. These testbeds will also be useful in evaluation of
    in-field sensing, decision making, data science, and visual analytics solutions.
    Moreover, by targeted research development in controlling contamination of agricultural
    products during all stages of production and processing a new era can be created
    for a sustainable and healthy community. Pilot studies are also needed for innovations
    in storage and transport of grains, fruits, and vegetables to minimize loss caused
    by pests. The agriculture is becoming exceedingly vulnerable to the soil degradation,
    water scarcity, deteriorating mountain ecosystems, and more variable and intense
    weather patterns (e.g., floods, drought, frosts). However, there are major gaps
    in our understanding of changes in agriculture and how these changes will effect
    agriculture. Improved knowledge needs to be acquired to anticipate, plan, and
    adapt to these changes and to gain new grounds in agriculture. Furthermore, efforts
    are needed to develop better detection techniques for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
    substances (PFAS), and PFAS-containing waste found in different soils. Among existing
    techniques, granular activated carbon (GAC) is a growing technology in PFAS treatment
    in water [23], [7]. However, there is a significant lack of data and procedure
    development in terms of fundamental understanding and quantification of medium
    properties. The adsorptive and destructive technologies, are considered for both
    soils and waters [9], [6]. Other remediation approaches are anion-exchange, ozofractionation,
    chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, sonolysis, soils stabilization,
    and thermal technologies [5], [15], [21], [22]. These treatment technologies are
    not best suited to provide PFAS management systems with almost real-time sensing
    data to facilitate fast decision making [14], [13]. To meet the need of practical
    approaches to manage the potential environmental impacts of PFAS, environmental
    researchers must develop and implement new technologies to enhance detection and
    control of PFAS with fewer inputs. Enhanced techniques that are more practical
    and efficient in control, treatment, destruction, and removal of PFAS in soils
    are needed. This complex and arduous task requires interdisciplinary endeavors
    that combine various environmental science disciplines to develop such tools and
    implement them in the field to achieve this purpose. The improved knowledge of
    different soil systems will contribute to the development of better underground
    sensing techniques. Lack of long term, large scale soil measurements is a major
    challenge as the existing models to predict different soil properties are developed
    using small scale testbeds and field measurements that also involves removal of
    soil from field locations for laboratory analysis. New technologies are needed
    to better understand the carbon and nitrogen cycle. To achieve this objective,
    the technology researchers and soil scientist have to play a dynamic role to develop
    advanced in-situ systems capable of measuring physical, chemical, and biological
    properties of soil in large scale fields containing different types of soil. In
    this regard, the recent advancements in the field of health and energy can be
    employed in precision agriculture. Effective and reliable soil moisture sensing
    and irrigation management techniques also depend on advances in underground sensing
    and communication technology. Major challenges in these areas are manual installation
    and removal of soil moisture sensors during pre- and post-growing seasons and
    privacy concerns of the farmers about their fields. To overcome these precision
    agriculture adoption barriers, underground IoT with long term sensing capability
    coupled with wireless underground communications and networking are needed. To
    build technology-aware, advanced precision agriculture practices, the innovation
    and automation in underground sensing and secure communications, data collection,
    analysis, and visualization will play a vital role [36], [35]. Sensors for soil
    and water quality across networked landscapes need to be developed. Moreover,
    integration of advances in precision agriculture data analytics, in-situ and remote
    sensing into working systems, indigenous and local information is required [10],
    [11]. The development and application of novel sensing and communication techniques
    for water resource conservation and enhancement of the crop yield is a major area
    in need of technology innovations. A large scale field IoT can be built using
    these wired and wireless technologies and sensing solutions. Creation of networked
    collection of existing soil type and moisture related databases will improve access
    to large scale consolidated data for decision making. SECTION V. Conclusions In
    conclusion, innovations and new knowledge are vital to enable a comprehensive
    and integrated technology approach to precision agriculture. Expertise across
    multiple domains including engineering and technology, agronomy, environmental
    sensing and monitoring, phonemics, soil fertility, entomology, data mining, machine
    learning and robotics are needed. All efforts should be made to connect expertise
    across these domains to examine important technology development and adoption
    challenges in precision agriculture. The application of the latest innovations
    in technology, sensing and communications will allow for substantial improvements
    in precision agriculture practices and management solutions. Authors Figures References

    \ returns, often also with the goal to reduce the \nimpact on the environment.\
    \ One of the key elements of smart farming is the farm manage-\nment information\

    \ such as choice of communication \nprotocols, the data processing capacity, the\

    Smart farming represents the application of modern information and communication\
    \ technol-\nogies (ICT) into agriculture to increase the amount of production\
    \ and economic returns, often \nalso with the goal to reduce the impact on the\
    \ environment (Rains and Thomas 2009). Similar \n * Ö. Köksal \n \nkoksal@aselsan.com.tr\n\

    \ Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nterms are used for the same purpose such\
    \ as precision agriculture, site-specific farming, site-\nspecific crop management,\
    \ prescription farming, and satellite farming (Adamchuk et al. 2004; \nZhang et al.\
    \ 2002). Smart farming builds on advanced technology such as cloud computing,\
    \ \nremote sensing, data-driven farming, big data analytics and internet of things\
    \ (IoT). Several \nimportant benefits of smart farming have been provided in the\
    \ literature including optimiz-\ning production efficiency, optimizing quality\
    \ of the crop, minimizing environmental impact, \nminimizing risk, conservation\
    \ of resources, reducing cost, increasing profit, and better man-\nagement decisions\
    \ (Sørensen et al. 2010, 2011; Rains and Thomas 2009; Zhang et al. 2002).\nOne\
    \ of the key elements of the smart farming is the farm management information\
    \ system \n(FMIS). Although initially FMISs started as simple record keeping systems,\
    \ modern FMISs \nare sophisticated systems with advanced modules supporting a\
    \ comprehensive set of farm-\ning operations (Fountas et al. 2015). With the introduction\
    \ of IoT, FMIS and smart farming \nin general have gained a new momentum. The\
    \ IoT helps in smart and automated information \ngathering and merging. It helps\
    \ as well as in monitoring sensor data coming from different \nmachines, animals,\
    \ plants, other farms and greenhouses and other systems such as unmanned \nair\
    \ and land vehicles. In this way, the decision making and planning in the agricultural\
    \ domain \ncan be further supported which can lead to even more effective and\
    \ efficient farming. With \nthe help of the IoT, farming practices such as yield\
    \ monitoring, cultivar selection, pest man-\nagement, irrigation, etc. can be\
    \ applied more precisely. Crop yield can be monitored and pre-\ncise crop maps\
    \ which show high and low production areas can be obtained readily (Rains and\
    \ \nThomas 2009).\nFor developing an IoT-based FMIS it is important to design\
    \ the proper IoT architecture \nwhich represents the overall gross level structure\
    \ of the system. IoT based farm management \ninformation systems typically have\
    \ different functional requirements such as the type of crop, \nthe type of sensors,\
    \ communication protocols, and the data processing capacity. Besides of \nfunctional\
    \ requirements also quality requirements such as security level, safety level,\
    \ time \nperformance, and overall cost of development and operation are also different\
    \ for different \napplications.\nThe different requirements typically require\
    \ changing the IoT architecture. In the literature, \nseveral reference architectures\
    \ for FMISs and IoT have been proposed that can be reused to \nderive the IoT\
    \ application architecture. Deriving the proper architecture however is far from\
    \ \ntrivial and this can impede the success of the IoT system. The objective of\
    \ this study is to con-\ntribute to the current state-of-the-art of FMISs by enhancing\
    \ the current architecture design \napproaches for IoT-based FMIS. Hereby, the\
    \ study aims to provide an architecture design \nmethod for designing IoT-based\
    \ FMISs. The approach presented adopts a feature-driven \ndomain analysis approach\
    \ to model the different smart farming requirements. Further, based \non FMIS\
    \ and IoT reference architectures the steps and the modeling approaches for design-\n\
    ing the IoT-based FMIS architecture are described. The approach is illustrated\
    \ using two case \nstudies on smart farming in Turkey, one for developing IoT-based\
    \ FMIS for smart wheat pro-\nduction in Konya, and the other for smart green houses\
    \ in Antalya.\nBackground and related work\nInternet of things (IoT)\nUntil recent\
    \ time, the internet was primarily used for interconnecting computers any \ntime\
    \ and any place but this required human interaction and monitoring. The IoT is\
    \ a new \n 928\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nparadigm that adds\
    \ a dimension to the current information and communications technolo-\ngies (ICTs),\
    \ whereby the dimension “Anything communication” is added to the communi-\ncation\
    \ capabilities. The IoT enables anytime, anyplace connectivity for anything, by\
    \ linking \nthe objects of the real world with the virtual world. In the IoT world\
    \ physical things and \nvirtual things, all interact with each other in the same\
    \ space and time.\nSince the IoT is the result of technological progress in many\
    \ fields such as wireless \nsensor networks, machine-to-machine communication,\
    \ mobile computing, ubiquitous \ncomputing, and embedded systems, the term “IoT”\
    \ might have different meanings. Many \ndefinitions of IoT can be found in the\
    \ literature, but the IoT is defined by the International \nTelecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU) as “the network of physical objects or ‘things’ embedded \nwith\
    \ electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these\
    \ objects \nto collect and exchange data”. Here “thing” is defined as: an object\
    \ of the physical world \n(physical things) or the information world (virtual\
    \ things), which is capable of being iden-\ntified and integrated into communication\
    \ networks (ITU 2005). McEwen and Cassimally \n(2014) formulate the IoT with a\
    \ simple equation as: “Physical Object + Controller, Sensor, \nand Actuators +\
    \ Internet = IoT”.\nThe IoT is the result of technological progress in many parallel\
    \ and often overlap-\nping fields, including those of embedded systems, ubiquitous\
    \ and pervasive computing, \nmobile telephony, telemetry and machine-to-machine\
    \ communication, wireless sensor \nnetworks, mobile computing, and computer networking.\
    \ What is important is that IoT \nadds a dimension to the current ICTs, which\
    \ already provide “any time” and “any place” \ncommunication.\nVarious reference\
    \ architectures have been provided for the IoT. In general, IoT archi-\ntecture\
    \ is represented as a layered architecture. In this case a “layer” simply represents\
    \ a \ngrouping of modules that offers a cohesive set of services. Based on the\
    \ literature (Al-\nFuqaha et al. 2015; Pandya and Champaneria 2015; Gazis et al.\
    \ 2015; Palattella et al. 2013; \nSheng et al. 2013) the reference architecture\
    \ is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe reference architecture includes the following layers:\
    \ device, network, session, appli-\ncation, business, management and security.\
    \ The device layer consists of sensors and physi-\ncal devices. This layer identifies\
    \ and collects data and specific information generated by \nsensors and physical\
    \ devices. The data gathered is passed to the network layer. In essence \nthe\
    \ device layer bridges the gap between the physical world and the digital world.\
    \ The \nnetwork layer provides functionality for networking connectivity and transport\
    \ capabilities. \nThis layer is also called transport layer. This layer securely\
    \ transmits data gathered from \nsensors to the session layer. The transmission\
    \ medium can be wired or wireless. The ses-\nsion layer is responsible for service\
    \ management and consists of functionality for setting \nup and taking down of\
    \ the association between the IoT connection points. Several session \nFig. 1\
    \  IoT reference architecture\nDevice Layer\nNetwork Layer\nSession Layer\nSecurity\
    \ Layer\nManagement Layer\nApplication Layer\nBusiness Layer\n929\nPrecision Agriculture\
    \ (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nlayer standards and protocols are offered by different\
    \ organizations. Although most of \nthese standards and protocols use the transmission\
    \ control protocol (TCP) or the user data-\ngram protocol (UDP) for transport,\
    \ they have different architectures and characteristics for \nvarious purposes.\
    \ The application layer contains the IoT services and manages the system \nusing\
    \ the data from the session layer. The implemented IoT application can be, for\
    \ exam-\nple, smart farming, smart city, and smart home. The business layer defines\
    \ business logic \nand workflows. This layer is responsible for the management\
    \ of all IoT systems, services \nand applications within the domain. The business\
    \ models are defined in this layer based \non the data gathered from the application\
    \ layer. The data is analyzed to build the required \nbusiness models and define\
    \ the strategies. The security layer is a side-car layer relating \nto the other\
    \ five layers and provides the security functionality. Similarly, the management\
    \ \nlayer is a side-car layer supporting capabilities such as device management,\
    \ local network \ntopology management, and traffic and congestion management (Köksal\
    \ and Tekinerdogan \n2017; Khan et al. 2012).\nArchitecture design\nSoftware architecture\
    \ for a program or computing system consists of the structure or struc-\ntures\
    \ of that system, which comprise elements, the externally visible properties of\
    \ those \nelements, and the relationships among them (Venters et al. 2018; Tekinerdogan\
    \ 2014; Bass \net al. 2012; Clements et al. 2010). Software architecture forms\
    \ one of the key artifacts in \nthe entire software development life cycle since\
    \ it embodies the earliest design decisions \nand includes the gross-level components\
    \ that directly impact the subsequent analysis, \ndesign and implementation (Apel\
    \ et al. 2013). It is generally accepted that software archi-\ntecture design\
    \ plays a fundamental role in coping with the inherent difficulties of the devel-\n\
    opment of large-scale and complex software. Research on architecture design in\
    \ the last \ntwo decades has resulted in different useful techniques and approaches.\n\
    Architectural drivers define the concerns of the stakeholders. A stakeholder is\
    \ defined \nas an individual, team, or organization with interests in, or concerns\
    \ relative to, a system. \nEach of the stakeholders’ concerns impacts the early\
    \ design decisions that the architect \nmakes. A common practice is to model different\
    \ “architectural views” for describing the \ndesign according to the stakeholders’\
    \ concerns (Tekinerdogan 2014; Demirli and Tekiner-\ndogan 2011; Clements et al.\
    \ 2010). An architectural view is a representation of a set of sys-\ntem elements\
    \ and relations associated with them to support a particular concern (Clements\
    \ \net al. 2010). Having multiple views helps to separate the concerns and as\
    \ such support the \nmodeling, understanding, communication and analysis of the\
    \ software architecture for dif-\nferent stakeholders. Architectural views conform\
    \ to viewpoints that represent the conven-\ntions for constructing and using such\
    \ a representation. An architectural framework organ-\nizes and structures the\
    \ proposed viewpoints.\nA recent software architecture framework approach is the\
    \ so-called Views and Beyond \n(V&B) approach (Clements et al. 2010). The approach\
    \ distinguishes three different catego-\nries of viewpoints or styles including\
    \ module, component-and-connector, and allocation \nstyles:\n• “Module” view category\
    \ that is used for documenting a system’s principal units of \nimplementation.\n\
    • “Component and Connector” category that is used for documenting the system’s\
    \ units \nof execution.\n 930\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\n\
    • “Deployment View” category that is used to document the relationships between\
    \ a sys-\ntem’s software and its development and execution environments.\nA software\
    \ architecture that addresses the concerns of specific stakeholders is here \n\
    referred to as “concrete architecture”. A concrete architecture defines the boundaries\
    \ and \nconstraints for the implementation and is used to analyze risks, balance\
    \ trade-offs, plan \nthe implementation project and allocate tasks (Tekinerdogan\
    \ 2014). Concrete architectures \ncan be viewed as specific implementations of\
    \ “reference architectures”, which are generic \ndesigns. In turn, a reference\
    \ architecture is derived from the knowledge and experiences \naccumulated in\
    \ designing concrete architectures in the past (Cloutier et al. 2010; Angelov\
    \ \net al. 2012). The concrete architectures differ from one case to the next\
    \ depending on the \nrequirements of the stakeholders involved. Reference architectures\
    \ can be used descrip-\ntively to “capture the essence of existing architectures”\
    \ or prescriptively to guide the devel-\nopment of new ones (Cloutier et al. 2010).\n\
    Related work\nSeveral studies discuss the adoption of internet technologies to\
    \ support FMIS (Kruize et al. \n2016; Fountas et al. 2015; Kaloxylos et al. 2012;\
    \ Steinberger et al. 2009; Nikkilä et al. \n2010; Sørensen et al. 2010; Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2010; Seelan et al. 2003; Murakami et al. 2007). \nThese studies have\
    \ focused on different issues including the adoption of service-oriented \narchitectures\
    \ for FMIS (Murakami et al. 2007; Steinberger et al. 2009; Wolfert et al. 2010),\
    \ \nthe development of data exchange standards for supporting interoperability\
    \ over the inter-\nnet (Schmitz et al. 2009), and the adoption and implementation\
    \ of geographic informa-\ntion systems (GIS) (Seelan et al. 2003). The main focus\
    \ of these studies is integration and \noperation of an FMIS over the internet.\
    \ The integration and adoption of IoT in the FMIS is \nnot explicitly considered.\n\
    In (Murakami et al. 2007), a distributed service-oriented reference architecture\
    \ is pro-\nposed for the development of information systems for precision agriculture.\
    \ This web-\nbased approach is focused on communication between software on a\
    \ service bus. In \n(Schmitz et al. 2009), the so-called AgroXML is proposed as\
    \ a standardized language based \non extensible markup language (XML) to be used\
    \ for data exchange in FMIS. In Nikkilä \net  al. (2010), a web-based approach\
    \ is defined to implement connectivity requirements \narising from the internet\
    \ and the management of GIS data. In (Sørensen et al. 2010), a new \nmodel for\
    \ FMIS is proposed to provide better information handling focusing on internal\
    \ \ndata connection, external information collection, plan generation, and report\
    \ generation in \nFMIS. In Kaloxylos et al.(2012), an architecture is proposed\
    \ to provide support and inte-\ngration of different stakeholders and services,\
    \ and interworking with the external services.\nThere are some studies in the\
    \ literature related to web-based architectures (Steinberger \net  al. 2009; Chaudhary\
    \ et  al. 2004). These studies present architectures to enhance the \neffectiveness\
    \ of web-based decision support system on which data can be requested for \nfurther\
    \ use via a web portal and a web service interface.\nInstead of full FMIS most\
    \ architecture academic research on FMIS is restricted to indi-\nvidual component\
    \ of an FMIS such as predicting crop yield, implementing a special sen-\nsor,\
    \ and the usability of an FMIS. There are only few studies that explicitly discuss\
    \ FMIS \narchitectures in a comprehensive manner (Nikkilä et al. 2010). For example,\
    \ in (Linseisen \n2001), FMIS architecture is discussed by focusing on an information\
    \ system gathering and \nstoring high accuracy GPS data. In Beck (2001), an architecture,\
    \ based on implementing \n931\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\n\
    object databases such as common object request broker architecture (CORBA) middleware\
    \ \nand Java languages is proposed to provide easier development, maintenance,\
    \ and easier \nintegration of information systems.\nAdvances in the functionality\
    \ of academic and commercial FMIS are presented in \n(Fountas et al. 2015). This\
    \ study investigates commercial and academic FMIS packages \nand performs a cluster\
    \ analysis on them. The authors indicate that commercial packages \ntend to target\
    \ daily farm office tasks such as budgeting, finance, recordkeeping, machinery\
    \ \nmanagement, and documentation. On the other hand, academic FMISs deal with\
    \ compli-\nance to standards, automated data capture, and interoperability issues.\n\
    There are also studies that discuss traditional on-site FMIS software. However,\
    \ these \nstudies mainly focus on the improvement of information integration of\
    \ traditional FMIS \nand do not take IoT technologies into account. For example,\
    \ Verdouw et al. (2016), pro-\npose an architecture to improve the standardization\
    \ and integration of data, application, and \nprocess. A service-oriented architecture\
    \ (SOA) based solution is proposed to improve the \ninformation integration implementing\
    \ business process management (BMP).\nRelated to IoT is the research on wireless\
    \ sensor networks which is reviewed in Jawad \net al. (2017) and Aqeel-Ur-Rehman\
    \ et al. (2014). These studies primarily focused on com-\nparing sensors and communication\
    \ technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wifi, Sigfox, \nWibree, long range radio\
    \ and GPRS. Although these protocols might increase the number \nof possibilities\
    \ to communicate data in IoT, these studies do not directly offer design solu-\n\
    tions for FMIS.\nThis paper has focused on applying IoT for FMIS in particular.\
    \ However, IoT has also \nbeen applied in different application domains. The application\
    \ of IoT in agriculture has \nbeen reviewed in Verdouw et al. (2016). This review\
    \ showed that the IoT concept cap-\ntured the attention of the scientific community\
    \ in 2010 and since then number of stud-\nies has continuously increased. In total\
    \ 168 papers and books were reviewed in the paper. \nThe identified top topics\
    \ of these studies include food supply chains, arable farming, gen-\neral agriculture,\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and livestock farming, and open-air horticulture \n\
    including orchards. On the other hand, it is stated that IoT applications mostly\
    \ focus on \nbasic functionalities, including tracking, tracing, monitoring, and\
    \ event management. It is \nconcluded that although IoT is receiving an increasing\
    \ level of attention, it is still in its \ninfancy in the agriculture and food\
    \ domain which is suffering from lack seamless integra-\ntion and advanced solutions.\n\
    Case studies and problem statement\nIn this section, the problem statement is\
    \ presented that is illustrated using two case studies \nof smart farming in Turkey.\
    \ The case studies have been selected based on their relevance \nand their difference\
    \ with respect to the functional and quality requirements. The case stud-\nies\
    \ include the development of IoT-based FMIS for wheat production and tomato produc-\n\
    tion in Turkey. In the following, first the details of each case study are presented,\
    \ and sub-\nsequently the problem statement is described.\nCase study: wheat production\n\
    Turkey has 23.9 million hectares of cultivated farms. Grain production occupies\
    \ 49% of \nthis area. Wheat production constitutes 67% of the total grain production\
    \ (Turkish Land \n 932\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nCrop Office\
    \ 2017). Turkey’s wheat production is about 20 million tons yearly (Turkish \n\
    Ministry of Agriculture 2018). As such, wheat production is one of the most important\
    \ \nagriculture businesses in Turkey.\nOne of the key regions of wheat production\
    \ in Turkey is the region of Konya which is \nfar from costal area and located\
    \ on a major plain near the middle of Turkey. Konya has a \nterrestrial climate,\
    \ and big arable farms. Konya is the region in Turkey with the largest \nwheat\
    \ production. It produces 3 million tons of wheat yearly.\nCase study: tomato\
    \ production in greenhouses\nThe second case study is of tomato production in\
    \ greenhouses in Antalya. Tomato produc-\ntion in the world is 170 million tons\
    \ yearly and almost 12 million tons of this production is \nproduced in Turkey.\
    \ Turkey exports tomatoes and tomato products to many countries. The \ntotal export\
    \ is about 600 000 tons. Tomato is produced both in open fields and in green-\n\
    houses. About 51% of greenhouse production in Turkey is tomato.\nAntalya is located\
    \ in the south of Turkey just north of the Mediterranean coast. The \ntypical\
    \ Mediterranean climate of the region is suitable for vegetable and fruit production.\
    \ \nCurrently, specialty greenhouse farming is very common in Antalya. Some 80%\
    \ of glass \ngreenhouses and 50% of plastic greenhouses of Turkey are in Antalya.\n\
    Problem description\nGenerally, wheat and tomato are produced with traditional\
    \ farming practices in Konya and \nAntalya regions. A general observation from\
    \ governmental reports is that a small part of \nthe farmers in these regions\
    \ use traditional FMIS (Turkish Ministry of Agriculture 2018). \nEven with the\
    \ use of FMISs several problems in the agricultural sector could still be \nidentified.\n\
    Inefficient crop production\nTo meet the growing population in Turkey it is important\
    \ to increase the crop production, \nwhich requires a more effective and efficient\
    \ crop production. According to the Turkish \nStatistical Institute (TSI), Turkey\
    \ is one of the top 10 wheat producers in the world. But \nthis production is\
    \ not sufficient for Turkey’s growing internal demand. In order to com-\npensate\
    \ the need, Turkey imports more than 4 million tons of wheat each year. From the\
    \ \nefficiency point (tons/hectare) of view improvements are required and possible.\
    \ Turkey’s \naverage wheat yield is about 2.6 tons/ha.\nInefficient usage of soil\n\
    Turkey has 2.2 million farmers, and 23.9 million hectares cultivated farms but\
    \ 17% of ara-\nble farms are fallow (Turkish Ministry of Agriculture 2018). One\
    \ of the reasons for this is \ndue to lack of insight and support regarding decision\
    \ making on crop production, soil ferti-\nlization, and pesticide management.\n\
    933\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nIncrease in cost of farming\
    \ inputs\nIn the last years the cost of fertilizers, fuel and pesticides have\
    \ dramatically increased, but \nthe usage of these inputs has not been effectively\
    \ monitored. This has adversely affected \nfarming and greenhouse production profit.\
    \ As a result of this, the number of farmers in \nthese domains have decreased\
    \ and the overall production has declined. To solve these prob-\nlems, better\
    \ monitoring and management of inputs is required to decrease the overall costs.\n\
    These problems can, to some extent, be tackled by focusing on improved business\
    \ and \nlogistics processes, by applying total quality and smart farming principles,\
    \ and appropri-\nate sensing and effector technologies. Yet, these solutions remain\
    \ limited compared to the \nadoption of IoT that provides further optimization\
    \ by enabling the integration of various \ntechnologies such as (wireless) sensor\
    \ networks, mobile computing, cloud network, data \nanalytics, and decision support\
    \ systems.\nTo cope with these problems IoT can be considered a feasible solution\
    \ (Dlodlo and \nKalezhi 2015; Ma et  al. 2011). IoT enables the use of sensors\
    \ to measure the required \nparameters (e.g. soil quality), support the decision-making\
    \ process using services such as \ndata analytics, and use actuators to execute\
    \ the proper action at the right time and right \nplace. This is for example the\
    \ case for the wheat and tomato production that has been \ndescribed in the previous\
    \ sections. With the introduction of IoT several benefits are envi-\nsioned. Firstly,\
    \ determining the variability in yield potential might allow optimizing pro-\n\
    duction at each site. With the help of smart farming practices such as site-specific\
    \ soil \nnutrition management, quality of the soil can be improved. Also, pest\
    \ management allows \nmapping pest populations and obtaining site-specific application\
    \ maps reducing pesticide \nusage and minimizing environmental impact. Managing\
    \ farming practices and obtaining \nprofit maps can help reducing the risk in\
    \ agriculture. Better irrigation, fertilization prac-\ntices, and pest management\
    \ strategies save resources. Crop production problems can be \nsolved more precisely\
    \ and in less time with smart farming. Further, long term data can \nbe collected\
    \ and analyzed, leading to better strategic management decisions. Saving input\
    \ \nmaterials and resources enables reducing labor requirements and cost. Finally,\
    \ reducing \ncost and improving quality will increase profits obtained. So far\
    \ with the existing FMIS \nthese goals could not be fully realized or are only\
    \ achieved to a limited extent.\nAlthough IoT promises to be very worthwhile,\
    \ it is not easy to develop an IoT-based \nFMIS. In the literature, various different\
    \ reference architectures have been proposed for \nboth IoT and FMIS. Recently,\
    \ the two concepts are further integrated leading to an IoT \nbased FMIS architecture.\
    \ Unfortunately, deriving a concrete application architecture for \nthe specific\
    \ farming situation is far from trivial. This is because the existing architectures\
    \ \nare usually represented as reference architectures that are too abstract and\
    \ do not consider \nfurther details that are required to derive the application\
    \ architecture. To derive the con-\ncrete architecture for a particular context,\
    \ the different features of FMIS and IoT should be \nselected. This includes for\
    \ example the different management functionality, the security \nprotocols, the\
    \ device communication protocols, and the cloud services. For each of these \n\
    many different selections can be made and the combination of these leads to a\
    \ broad design \nspace.\nObviously, given a description for the smart farming\
    \ system many different architecture \nalternatives can be identified. Since the\
    \ architecture has a direct systemic impact on the \noverall IoT based smart farming\
    \ it is important to derive the proper architecture to meet the \noverall smart\
    \ farming requirements of the stakeholders. For guiding the architect in deriv-\n\
    ing the customized concrete architecture a systematic approach is necessary.\n\
    \ 934\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nFMIS development method\n\
    In Fig. 2, the proposed development approach for deriving an IoT-based FMIS applica-\n\
    tion architecture is shown. The approach consists of two basic activities including\
    \ Domain \nEngineering and FMIS Development. In essence, the approach is based\
    \ on the product line \nengineering process as described in the literature (Tüzün\
    \ et al. 2015; Capilla et al. 2014; \nApel et al. 2013).\nThe Domain Engineering\
    \ activity focuses on developing and preparing the development \nartefacts (e.g.\
    \ design and code) for the FMIS. The first step includes the development of an\
    \ \nIoT FMIS family feature model that defines the common and variant features\
    \ of the differ-\nent FMISs. The subsequent step focuses on developing the reference\
    \ architecture for IoT \nbased FMIS. The final step in the domain engineering\
    \ activity aims to develop the reusable \ncomponents that will be necessary to\
    \ develop the FMIS based on the reference architec-\nture. The following sections\
    \ elaborate on the development of the family feature model and \nthen present\
    \ the corresponding reference architecture.\nThe FMIS development activity focuses\
    \ on a specific IoT-based FMIS. The FMIS will \nbe developed based on reuse of\
    \ the artefacts in the domain engineering activity. The first \nstep in the application\
    \ engineering includes the selection of the features of the application. \nFurther,\
    \ the features will include both features for the IoT and the FMIS. These will\
    \ be \nusually different for different FMISs in different contexts. Based on the\
    \ selected features \nthe specific FMIS application architecture will be developed\
    \ starting from the reference \narchitecture of the domain engineering activity.\
    \ The final step includes the implementation \nof the FMIS. In this final step,\
    \ the components developed earlier in the domain engineering \nactivity will be\
    \ reused. Very often a simulation system can be developed for FMIS to vali-\n\
    date the system before deciding on the large-scale investment.\nDomain Engineering\n\

    \ \n1 3\nFamily feature model\nThe first step of the domain engineering activity\
    \ of the proposed approach in Fig. 2 is \nthe development of a family feature\
    \ diagram for IoT-based FMIS. A feature diagram is \na tree that is used to model\
    \ the commonalities and differences within a specific domain \nor system. The\
    \ feature diagram includes a root node representing the domain or system \nthat\
    \ features the essential characteristics or externally visible properties of the\
    \ system \n(Tekinerdogan et al. 2012). Features may have sub-features which can\
    \ lead to a hier-\narchical tree. Features can be mandatory or variant. Variant\
    \ features are usually rep-\nresented as optional or alternative features. Optional\
    \ features can be selected or not, \nwhereby alternative features require the\
    \ selection of one of the defined features. A fea-\nture configuration is a set\
    \ of features which describes a member of a communication \nprotocol. A feature\
    \ constraint further restricts the possible selection of features to define \n\
    configurations.\nThe domain analysis consists of two basic activities including\
    \ domain scoping and \ndomain modeling. In the scoping process, the domain scope\
    \ is defined and the set of \nknowledge sources are selected. In the domain modeling\
    \ process the feature diagram is \nprovided.\nDuring the domain scoping process\
    \ for the IoT based FMIS, not only scientific papers \nbut also websites and white\
    \ papers of the important vendors and stakeholders in the IoT \nand smart farming\
    \ domains have been considered. The selected list of important sources \nthat\
    \ were considered for IoT are shown in Appendix 1, the list of sources for smart\
    \ farming \nare shown in Appendix 2. It is not claimed that the set of sources\
    \ is comprehensive but an \nanalysis of these selected studies shows a convergence\
    \ and agreement on the concepts. In \nthe following section the feature diagram\
    \ for IoT is described first followed by a descrip-\ntion of the feature diagram\
    \ for smart farming.\nFeature model for IoT\nBased on the primary studies given\
    \ in Appendix 1, the top-level feature diagram of the IoT \nas given in Fig. 3\
    \ is obtained. In essence, the top-level figure diagram presents the design \n\
    features and as such includes the mandatory features for the layers of the earlier\
    \ defined IoT \nreference architecture in Fig. 1. The feature diagram states that\
    \ all the layers are mandatory \nfor setting up an IoT system.\nFor each of the\
    \ layers a detailed feature diagram that represents the commonalities and \nvariability\
    \ for the corresponding layer can be derived. Among the IoT layers it appears\
    \ that \nthe decisive layer is the session layer that includes the protocols for\
    \ initiating the connec-\ntion and the further communication session. Figure 4\
    \ shows the feature diagram that was \nderived from the domain analysis to the\
    \ IoT session layer communication protocols.\nThe top-level mandatory features\
    \ in the feature diagram are protocol type, source-target, \ntransport type and\
    \ architecture. The protocol type feature defines the protocols that were \nidentified\
    \ from the selected primary studies. These identified protocols are the following:\n\
    • Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT): One of the most popular protocols\
    \ to \ncollect device data and communicate with servers (OASIS 2011).\n• Extensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): is based on exchanges of XML \nmessages\
    \ in real time that is defined to connect devices to servers (IETF 2011).\n 936\n\
    Precision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\n• Advanced Message Queuing Protocol\
    \ (AMQP): A queuing system designed to connect \nservers to each other (OASIS\
    \ 2011).\n• Data Distribution Service (DDS): A fast data bus for integrating devices\
    \ and systems \n(OMG 2015).\n• The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): A\
    \ specialized web-based protocol to be \nused in constrained nodes and constrained\
    \ networks (IETF 2011).\nAs given in Fig.  4, there are three types of source-target\
    \ relations available in ses-\nsion layer protocols: Device-to-Device (D2D), Device-to-Server\
    \ (D2S), and Server-to-\nServer (S2S). In some studies, these features are also\
    \ called Machine-to-Machine (M2M), \nMachine-to-Cloud (M2C), and Cloud-to-Cloud\
    \ (C2C) respectively.\nSession layer protocols are closely related to the network\
    \ layer. For all communication \nprotocols, the transport layer could be either\
    \ the user datagram protocol (UDP) or trans-\nmission control protocol (TCP).\
    \ Some protocols like DDS, support both UDP and TCP. \nThe addressing scheme (unicast,\
    \ broadcast, or multicast) might be important depending \non the application requirements.\
    \ The selection of network layer protocol is important since \nusing TCP and/or\
    \ UDP changes the characteristics of the communication from perfor-\nmance and\
    \ security perspectives. The layer below the network layer, that is the device\
    \ layer \nincludes the IoT devices that have a direct connection with the physical\
    \ devices. The physi-\ncal devices have different functionality and transmission\
    \ range. If low power devices and \nnetworks will be used, adoption of TCP in\
    \ the network layer is generally less feasible, and \nlikewise the UDP protocol\
    \ is used instead. On the other hand, TCP is required for support-\ning security\
    \ and the common security protocols of (SSL/TLS) are not available using UDP.\n\
    The architecture of the session layer protocols can be either publish-subscribe\
    \ or \nrequest-reply. In publish-subscribe architecture, participants (e.g. sensors)\

    \ \n1 3\ntopic on which several subscribers (e.g. cloud software) that are registered\
    \ to this topic \nmight read data. In this architecture publishers and subscribers\
    \ do not need to know each \nother, and do not need to be operating at the same\
    \ time, i.e. this communication type pro-\nvides time and space uncoupling. This\
    \ type of communication is well suited for data that \nmust flow from one producer\
    \ to many consumers. On the other hand, for the request-reply \narchitecture,\
    \ senders and receivers do need to know each other. The requester sends a \nrequest\
    \ message and waits for the response. When the replier (e.g. sensor) receives\
    \ the \nrequest, it responds with a reply message. The session layer protocols\
    \ of IoT generally use \npublish-subscribe architecture except in the case of\
    \ CoAP in which a request-reply pattern \nis adopted. There are many criteria\
    \ to select the right IoT session layer protocol depending \non the application\
    \ requirement. Further information on the selection of the proper IoT ses-\nsion\
    \ layer protocol is provided in (Köksal and Tekinerdogan 2017).\nFeature model\
    \ for farm management information systems\nFor IoT based smart farming the other\
    \ important domain is of smart farming itself. Similar \nto the IoT domain again\
    \ a domain analysis process has been applied in which relevant pri-\nmary studies\
    \ on smart farming were searched and based on these selected studies a feature\
    \ \ndiagram was derived representing the common and variant features. The selected\
    \ primary \nstudies are listed in Appendix 2. Based on the literature the following\
    \ sub-domains for \nsmart farming could be identified: (1) Global Positioning\
    \ Systems (GPS), (2) Geographical \nInformation Systems (GIS), (3) Sensors, (4)\
    \ Variable Rate Technology (VRT), (5) Yield \nMonitoring (YM), (6) Yield Mapping\
    \ (YMAP), and (7) Farm Management Information \nSystems (FMIS).\nFMIS software\
    \ is a core part of the smart farming. FMISs are used to collect and pro-\ncess\
    \ data used to manage all farming operations. The top-level feature diagram for\
    \ FMIS \nis given in Fig. 5. The right part of the feature diagram has been derived\
    \ from the FMIS \nfunctions as defined in (Fountas et al. 2015). The left part\
    \ focuses on the IoT related func-\ntionality of FMIS including collection of\
    \ data, processing data, visualization of data, com-\nmunication with external\
    \ systems, and system management. This paper will further focus \non the IoT FMIS\
    \ aspects.\nThe data acquisition feature defines the gathering of data from sensors\
    \ and other systems \nused in smart farming such as tractors, agribots and unmanned\
    \ vehicles. It includes func-\ntions for processing the gathered data whereby\
    \ useful information is extracted using data \nmining, machine learning, and image\
    \ processing. The data visualization feature defines the \ndisplaying of processed\
    \ data in different forms. Apart from classical tables, reports, and \nmonitoring\
    \ tools, dedicated visualization maps are essential for smart farming applications.\
    \ \nMaps such as yield maps, soil maps, lighting maps, and profit maps are displayed\
    \ for dif-\nferent purposes. The system management feature defines the management\
    \ of data acquisi-\ntion, processing, visualization, and external system communication\
    \ features of FMIS. The \nquality related functions such as reliability, scalability,\
    \ extensibility, and security are con-\nsidered in this feature. Finally, the\
    \ “communication with external systems” feature defines \nthe communication with\
    \ external systems, such as a weather forecast system. Each of these \nfeatures\
    \ are shown in a different color in Fig. 5 to refer to these in later sections.\n\
    \ 938\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nFeature model for IoT based\
    \ FMIS\nIn principle, IoT and FMIS are independent concepts and as such these\
    \ have been mod-\neled separately in the previous sub-sections. In principle the\
    \ features from the IoT feature \ndiagram and the features from the FMIS feature\
    \ diagram could have been selected. Alter-\nnatively, the notion of an IoT based\
    \ FMIS can be considered as the integration of both \nconcepts that needs to be\
    \ separately considered. To this end, Fig. 6 shows the integrated \nfamily feature\
    \ diagram derived from the feature models for IoT and FMIS. The focus was \non\
    \ FMIS as the dominant decomposition and the IoT features were integrated in the\
    \ sepa-\nrate leaves of the FMIS feature tree. In the figure for different type\
    \ of features different fill \npatterns have been used. The detailed feature diagram\
    \ given in Fig. 6 can in principle be \nfurther extended with respect to specific\
    \ project requirements. For the context of this paper \nthough, the provided feature\
    \ models are sufficient to illustrate the approach.\nIn IoT based FMIS, data acquisition\
    \ consists of IoT data acquisition and conventional \ndata acquisition to support\
    \ legacy systems. IoT data acquisition contains 5 alternative IoT \nsession layer\
    \ protocols as discussed earlier namely MQTT, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, and \nCoAP. Depending\
    \ on the application one or more protocols for IoT communication can \nbe selected\
    \ for the FMIS. In the earlier section the criteria for this have been described.\
    \ A \ntraditional data acquisition feature consists of ISOBUS and controller area\
    \ network (CAN) \nprotocols. As stated before, other (legacy or non-IoT) protocols\
    \ can be added to the feature \ndiagram.\nData processing features mainly depend\
    \ on the application type and include Image/\nVideo processing, data mining, data\
    \ logging, and decision-support features. One or more \nfeatures might be used\
    \ at the same time. Depending on the application requirements these \nfeatures\
    \ can be extended to use different processing features.\nFarm Management \nInforma\x12\

    control features. Finally, external services feature contains externally communicated\
    \ \nsystems such as weather forecast, finance services, and other external systems.\n\
    Reference architecture for FMIS\nOnce the family feature models for IoT based\
    \ FMISs have been developed, the next step \nis the development of the reference\
    \ architecture for the potential systems. In fact, in the \nliterature several\
    \ reference architectures have already been proposed for FMISs (Nikkilä \net al.\
    \ 2010; Sørensen et al. 2010, 2011; Beck 2001; Fountas et al. 2006) However, in\
    \ gen-\neral these reference architectures are either at a conceptual level and/or\
    \ do not consider IoT \naspects explicitly. Hence, in this section, the reference\
    \ architecture for IoT based FMIS will \nbe introduced. For this, selected viewpoints\
    \ of the Views and Beyond architecture frame-\nwork (Clements et al. 2010) will\
    \ be used including the decomposition viewpoint, layered \nviewpoint and deployment\
    \ viewpoint.\nDecomposition view\nThe decomposition view is used to show how system\
    \ responsibilities are partitioned across \nmodules and how these modules are\
    \ decomposed into sub-modules. Usually, the features \nin the feature diagram\
    \ are realized by one or more modules in the decomposition view. \nThe decomposition\
    \ view of the architecture depicts the overall structure of the architecture \n\
    which is reasonably decomposed into modular implementation units. It is regarded\
    \ as a \nfundamental view of the architecture since it serves as an input for\
    \ other views (e.g. work \nallocation view) and helps to communicate and define\
    \ the structure of the software. The \nproposed reference decomposition view for\
    \ the IoT based FMIS is given in Fig. 7. The \nmodules in the decomposition view\
    \ are colored to make the link with the earlier defined \nfeatures in the feature\
    \ diagrams of FMIS. In essence, the decomposition view includes the \nmodules\
    \ for data acquisition, data processing, data visualization, system management,\
    \ and \nmodules for communication with external services. The decomposition view\
    \ includes all \nthe possible modules for the various IoT based FMIS applications.\
    \ Note that in this case for \neach feature in the earlier feature diagram, one\
    \ module has been defined in the decomposi-\ntion view. Further the lower level\
    \ functionalities such as node discovery, and directory and \nname services, have\
    \ not been depicted. The following section explains the configuration of \na specific\
    \ decomposition view from this reference decomposition view.\nLayered view\nThe\
    \ layered view is similar to decomposition view since it reflects the division\
    \ of soft-\nware into units. The difference is that in a layered view, modules\
    \ are structured into layers, \nwhich interact based on a strict ordering relation.\
    \ This means that if layer A is allowed to \nuse layer B, layer A’s implementation\
    \ can use any public facilities of Layer B. However, \nlayer B cannot use any\
    \ facilities of layer A.\nFigure 8 shows the layered view for the IoT-based FMIS.\
    \ Here the dominant decomposi-\ntion is taken from the IoT layered view as it\
    \ was given in Fig. 1, and likewise it includes \nthe same layers of the IoT reference\
    \ architecture. The specific details are primarily in the \nhigher-level layers\
    \ including the business layer, the application layer and the data acqui-\nsition\
    \ layer. The FMIS business layer includes all required farm management operations\

    \ as Fertility Management, Nutrient Management, Pest Man-\nagement, Weed Management,\

    \ the connection with the \nsession layer protocols of the IoT. As such, this\
    \ layer includes the IoT session layer inter-\nfaces such as MQTT interface, and\
    \ XMPP interface. To support non-IoT systems, the mod-\nule conventional interface\
    \ also takes place in this layer.\nDeployment view\nThe earlier defined views\
    \ (decomposition, layered) focus on modeling the software mod-\nules of the IoT-based\
    \ FMIS. The deployment view elaborates on these views and is used \nto show the\
    \ allocation of the identified software modules to the hardware of a computing\
    \ \nplatform. The deployment view of an IoT based FMIS is given in Fig. 9. The\
    \ data pro-\ncessing module is deployed on the Central Cloud Server and Client\
    \ (Farmer) nodes. The \nother nodes are dedicated to sensors, actuators, and cameras.\
    \ The main sensors in the UAV/\nDrone and Satellite are cameras. Vehicles can\
    \ have their own sensors, actuators, and cam-\neras. Hence, these items can be\
    \ assigned to different nodes.\nCase study evaluation\nCase study protocol\nThe\
    \ primary objective of the case studies is to evaluate the impact of the developed\
    \ \narchitecture design method for IoT based FMIS. To evaluate the above research\
    \ ques-\ntions, the case study research protocol as defined by Runeson and Höst\
    \ (2008) has been \napplied. Based on this the indicated five steps have been\

    \ (3) execution with data collection on the studied case \n(4) analysis of collected\
    \ data (5) reporting.\nTable  1 shows the case study design elements. The case\
    \ study research has been \napplied both for a retrospective case and prospective\
    \ case. The retrospective case \nincluded a system which was developed before\
    \ and for which there was already an exist-\ning architecture with required design\
    \ documents. The prospective case includes the sys-\ntem that is planned to be\
    \ developed.\nThe goal for the retrospective study was to compare the earlier\
    \ result with the result \nthat is produced by proposed method. In this way it\
    \ was aimed to evaluate the effective-\nness of the method. For the prospective\
    \ case study, the aim was to evaluate both the \neffectiveness and the practicality\
    \ of the approach. The research questions were defined \naccordingly as it is\
    \ shown in the table.\nFor the adopted background and sources in the case study\
    \ research, official design \ndocuments have been used and interviews were held\
    \ with project managers and sys-\ntem architects. For the retrospective case study,\
    \ the requirements and design documents \nwere available, whereas for the prospective\
    \ case study only the requirements document \nwas available. For both case studies\
    \ project managers and system architects were inter-\nviewed. The project manager\
    \ had more than 20 years of experience in farm management \nsystem. The two system\
    \ architects had more than 15 years of experience in designing \nfarm management\
    \ systems.\nFor both case studies a qualitative data analysis approach has been\
    \ used. For the ret-\nrospective case study, indirect data analysis has been used\
    \ by analyzing the require-\nments documents, applying the method and comparing\
    \ the results of the method with \nthe existing architecture. For the prospective\
    \ case study, a direct and indirect data analy-\nsis approaches were used. For\
    \ the direct data analysis, semi-structured interviews were \nconducted, in which\
    \ a list of predefined set of questions were asked to the project man-\nager and\
    \ software architects. The predefined questions are listed in Table 2. The ques-\n\
    tions included a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) for\
    \ the pos-\nsible answers. In addition, explanation was asked for each question.\
    \ Note that although \nLikert scales are used for the evaluation of the approach,\
    \ it is not aimed to be quantita-\ntive but primarily qualitative. The interview\
    \ questions with Likert scales as such were \nused as supporting instruments to\
    \ the open semi-structured interview that were held \nwith the stakeholders.\n\
    The interview was organized as follows:\n1. First a meeting was scheduled with\
    \ the project manager and system architects for the \ninitial interview. The goal\
    \ of this interview was to capture the initial thoughts and experi-\nence on IoT\
    \ adoption.\n2. In the second step a short presentation was provided about the\
    \ goal of the developed \nmethod. Also, the operation of the method as well as\
    \ the final outcome was shortly \nexplained.\n3. In the third step the method\
    \ was applied both for the retrospective case (wheat produc-\ntion) and prospective\
    \ case (tomato production in greenhouses).\n4. In the fourth step, the researchers\
    \ analyzed the architecture design that resulted from \nthe application of the\
    \ method to the retrospective case and the prospective case.\n5. In the fifth\
    \ step, the researchers held a post interview with the subjects with the purpose\
    \ \nof identifying the impact of the method and its practicality.\n 944\nPrecision\

    \ sixth step, the researchers collectively assessed data from the initial interview,\
    \ \nreport delivered by the method, and the post interview. The assessment was\
    \ carried out \nseparately and later was discussed together to derive the lessons\
    \ learned.\nThe following subsection discusses the results of the above process\
    \ after the first two \nsteps. Subsequently the evaluation in step 4, 5 and 6\
    \ are described.\nFMIS architecture design\nAs stated before, the application\
    \ architecture is derived from the family feature model and \nthe reference architecture.\
    \ As described earlier the FMIS development method includes the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the application feature model and the application architecture.\nRetrospective\
    \ case study: smart wheat production\nFigure 10 shows the feature model for smart\
    \ wheat production that is derived after the \nanalysis of the existing case study.\
    \ This application feature model is obtained by reusing \nthe feature model for\
    \ FMIS given in Fig. 6 and selecting the features that are needed for \nthis case\
    \ study. As shown in the figure, for this case study, MQTT session layer protocol\
    \ \nof IoT is chosen. The main reasons were because open source implementations\
    \ of MQTT \ncould be used. MQTT supports TCP and device-to-server communication\
    \ which were con-\nsidered necessary in the given context. Likewise, the MQTT\
    \ feature of the IoT Data Acqui-\nsition will be used. Also, in order to support\
    \ conventional data acquisition with tractors \nused in wheat production ISOBUS\
    \ and CAN communications will be supported. Almost \nall data processing and data\
    \ visualization features are required for smart wheat production. \nSo almost\
    \ all of these features remained in the feature diagram of Smart Wheat Production.\
    \ \nFor this retrospective case study, the FMIS will be integrated with the external\
    \ weather \nforecast system only.\nTable 2  Questionnaire for the Interview\n\

    \ on the selected features as defined in Fig. 10, the application architecture\
    \ can now be \nderived. As discussed before, the architecture of a system is usually\
    \ described using multi-\nple different architecture views. For each of the required\
    \ architectural views it is necessary \nto develop the application arhiteture\
    \ view. Figure 11 shows the decomposition view of the \nSmart Wheat Production\
    \ that is obtained using the reference decomposition view given \nin Fig. 7. As\
    \ explained above, MQTT, ISOBUS, and CAN data acquisition modules will \nbe used\
    \ to support IoT communications. All the sub-features of the system management\

    \ and soil type mapping modules will be used to implement data visualization fea-\n\
    tures. All data processing modules namely image/video processing, data mining,\
    \ decision \nsupport, and data logging modules will be implemented. Finally, a\
    \ single external commu-\nnication interface: external weather forcast interface\
    \ module will be implemented.\nLayered view\nFigure 12 shows the layered view\
    \ of smart wheat production. Similar to the other views, \nthis view is also customized\
    \ from the reference layered view diagram which is given in \nFig. 8. Here the\
    \ modules of the decomposition view are distributed over the layers in the \n\
    layered view. The modules MQTT interface and conventional interface are allocated\
    \ to the \nFMIS-data acquisition layer. The FMIS-application layer includes the\
    \ modules data pro-\ncessing, data visualization, system management and communication\
    \ with external system. \nThe FMIS-business layer include fertility management,\
    \ nutrient management, pest man-\nagement, weed management, and irrigation management.\
    \ It was assumed that the other lay-\ners and the modules in these layers are\
    \ similar as defined in the reference architecture.\nDeployment view\nThe deployment\

    Prospective case study: IoT based smart tomato production in greenhouses\nSimilar\
    \ to the retrospective case study the steps of the approach have been applied\
    \ to derive \nthe FMIS architecture. Due to space limitations the description\
    \ of the steps will not be \nrepeated and the specific diagrams will not be shown.\
    \ It should be noted that unlike the \nretrospective case study, for the prospective\
    \ case study there was no ready defined architec-\nture. This did not have an\
    \ impact on the application of the method but for the evaluation the \ncomparison\
    \ with existing architecture could naturally not be done.\nResult of the evaluation\
    \ for the retrospective case study\nThe previous subsection has shown the application\
    \ of the approach. As defined in the \ncase study protocol the effectiveness and\
    \ practicality of the approach has been analyzed. \nThe results of the interview\
    \ showed that for all the asked questions a score of 4 or 5 were \nprovided. Based\
    \ on these results the effectiveness and practicality of the approach will be\
    \ \nelaborated on.\nEffectiveness of the approach\nFor assessing the effectiveness\
    \ of the approach, the resulting application architecture was ana-\nlyzed and\
    \ post-interviews were carried out. For the retrospective study the application\
    \ archi-\ntecture was described in different document formats including MS PowerPoint\
    \ and MS Visio. \nFurther some detailed design documents could be accessed. The\

    \ viewpoint approach and no systematic approach was used. Nev-\nertheless, it\
    \ was possible to analyze the existing application architecture and compare it\
    \ with \nthe application architecture that was derived using the presented approach.\
    \ For the compari-\nson three relations were identified including (1) convergence\
    \ (2) deviation (3) absence. The \nconvergence relation implies that similar architecture\
    \ elements could be identified in both the \narchitecture designs. Deviation implies\
    \ that the resulting application architecture had addi-\ntional elements that\
    \ were not defined in the existing architecture. Finally, absence defines that\
    \ \nthe resulting application architecture had missing elements that were defined\
    \ in the existing \narchitecture. Overall the result of the analysis showed that\
    \ the resulting application architec-\nture was quite similar to the existing\
    \ architecture. In general, the convergence was very high. \nSeveral deviation\
    \ and absence relations could be identified though. With respect to devia-\ntion\
    \ in the resulting application architecture the modules UAV/Drone Control and\
    \ External \nWeather Forecast Interface were not defined in the existing architecture.\
    \ On the other hand, \nalso some absence relations could be identified. For example,\
    \ the resulting application archi-\ntecture did not have the module Finance Interface\
    \ Module, Farmer Data Module, and Simula-\ntion Module that were explicitly defined\
    \ in the existing application architecture. This became \nalso apparent in the\
    \ post-interviews. In the interview, the questions 2, 3, 4 and 5 relate directly\
    \ \nto the effectiveness of the approach. The architects provided a score of at\
    \ least 4 for all these \nquestions indicating that the approach is largely effective\
    \ for the corresponding case.\nPracticality of the approach\nThe practicality\
    \ of the method was assessed though questions 6 to 9 of the questionnaire. \n\

    \ with the practicality of the method. Further it was stated that the architecture\
    \ \ndesign could now be more quickly designed. Another interesting issue that\
    \ was explicitly \nmentioned was the fact that the method helped to support communication\
    \ about the design \ndecisions early on. For the question “Will you use the method\
    \ again?” the answers were \npositive again and both architects indicated that\
    \ they would use this method for the sub-\nsequent project. The architects also\
    \ had some suggestions for improvement including the \nneed for allowing specific\
    \ delta modules when deriving the application architecture.\nResult of the evaluation\
    \ for the prospective case study\nSimilar to the results of the retrospective\
    \ study, the answers to the provided questions were \npositive and received a\
    \ score of 4 or higher. In the following the effectiveness and practi-\ncality\
    \ of the proposed approach is discussed for the prospective case study.\nEffectiveness\
    \ of the approach\nFor the retrospective case study, the resulting architecture\
    \ was compared with the existing \narchitecture to assess the effectiveness of\
    \ the approach. For this prospective case study, the \nresults could not be compared\
    \ with an existing application architecture since only require-\nments document\
    \ was provided and the application architecture had still to be designed. \nThe\
    \ requirements document was used to identify the required application feature\
    \ diagram. \nBased on this the application architecture was derived. The effectiveness\
    \ of the application \narchitecture and the overall approach was based on the\
    \ results of the interview.\nThe scores for the questions 2 to 5 related to effectiveness\
    \ were at least 4. This indicated \nthat the approach was effective for the given\
    \ case. The architects noted that the application \ncould be easily derived based\
    \ on the defined requirements.\nPracticality of the approach\nFor assessing the\
    \ practicality of the approach, the results of questions 6 to 10 were con-\nsidered.\
    \ Again, it appeared that these had all a score with at least 4. Similar to the\
    \ retro-\nspective case study the approach was found practical and easy to use.\
    \ Similar statements \nas in the retrospective case study were made. The explicitly\
    \ mentioned identified benefits \nincluded the reduction of effort to design the\
    \ architecture, discuss the design decisions, and \nthe surprisingly shorter learning\
    \ curve than expected.\nDiscussion\nThe introduction of the IoT has led to the\
    \ notion of IoT-based FMIS to support the smart \nfarming goals. This paper aimed\
    \ to integrate the IoT systems with the FMIS to align both \nsystems and create\
    \ additional value that cannot be achieved if these are considered sepa-\nrately.\
    \ This integration effort leads to the enhancement of the current FMIS with new\
    \ mod-\nules that support the smart farming operations based on IoT. In the presented\
    \ approach \nthese required new modules have been explicitly defined in addition\
    \ to the traditional FMIS \nmodules. The overall approach as such provides an\
    \ integrated view of the overall system to \nbetter support the architecture of\
    \ IoT-based FMIS.\n951\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nThe method\
    \ that was discussed can be adopted for deriving an IoT based FMIS archi-\ntecture\
    \ for multiple different systems. Hence, the focus is on the whole product family\
    \ of \nIoT based FMISs rather than on a single system. The notion of product families\
    \ or product \nline engineering and the corresponding systematic reuse is discussed\
    \ in detail in the prod-\nuct line engineering community (Clements 2006). The\
    \ presented method is inspired and \ncustomizes the product line engineering approach\
    \ in which reference models are developed \nand applications are developed by\
    \ reusing these reference models. The reference feature \ndiagram that was shown\
    \ aims to target and integrate the domains of IoT and FMIS. The \nfocus in this\
    \ paper was primarily to illustrate the overall method. The feature diagrams as\
    \ \nwell as the reference architecture design could be easily extended. The architectures\
    \ for IoT \nand FMIS were discussed separately and the integration of both for\
    \ supporting IoT based \nFMISs was illustrated. The architecture can be extended\
    \ in two ways. First of all, the dif-\nferent views could be further refined to\
    \ provide an even more comprehensive result. This \nwould require for example\
    \ to further detail the modules that are needed in the decomposi-\ntion view.\
    \ Secondly, the architecture representations could be extended with other architec-\n\
    ture views. Three architecture views were chosen including decomposition view,\
    \ layered \nview and deployment view. If needed other architecture views in the\
    \ architecture documen-\ntation process could be used as well. The complete versions\
    \ of the feature diagrams as well \nthe detailed implemented architecture designs\
    \ have not been shown due to confidentiality \nissues.\nThe reference architecture\
    \ is designed in such a way that it is generic enough to derive \ndifferent concrete\
    \ architectures. Nevertheless, as is the case for all reference models, the \n\
    reference architecture does not provide all the details. Likewise, a system which\
    \ requires \nvery dedicated features that were not anticipated would not be covered\
    \ by the reference \narchitecture. Furthermore, the focus has been on illustrating\
    \ the reference architecture and \nthe approach for deriving a concrete architecture.\
    \ This appeared to be useful and practical. \nHowever, it is not claimed that\
    \ the reference architecture is complete, and likewise further \nresearch can\
    \ be used to refine and enhance the reference architecture. For example, the \n\
    device layer and the related functionality have not been discussed in detail in\
    \ this article. \nThis could though be easily added without loss of generality\
    \ and applicability of the pro-\nposed approach.\nAlthough, the approach has been\
    \ shown for two important case studies in the smart \nagri-food sector, the method\
    \ can be also applied for the development of other FMISs. The \npaper did not\
    \ focus on the implementation of these systems. The reason for this is because\
    \ \nof confidentiality and the goal to prescribe the system-to-be in the prospective\
    \ case study. \nFor the prospective case study, it is decided to develop first\
    \ a simulation system to evaluate \nthe outcome of the method. This is considered\
    \ as part of future work.\nThis paper provided both the reference architecture\
    \ for IoT-based FMIS and the overall \napproach to derive a concrete architecture.\
    \ The idea of systematic guidelines for deriving a \nconcrete architecture could\
    \ also be used for enhancing the use of existing IoT-based refer-\nence architectures.\n\
    Although the proposed method has illustrated the development of IoT based FMISs,\
    \ the \nmethod could even be used for developing traditional FMISs. In that case\
    \ the IoT architec-\nture part would be omitted and just the development of reference\
    \ models for FMIS would \nbe considered.\nThis paper describes a domain-driven\
    \ approach to design IoT-based FMIS and support \nthe architect in deriving a\
    \ concrete IoT-based FMIS architecture. Several other important \nissues need\
    \ to be considered to realize effective smart farming. Important aspects include\
    \ \nthe acceptability of the provided IoT technology by the relevant stakeholders\
    \ including the \n 952\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nend-users,\
    \ development of cost-effective transition strategies, and farm management and\
    \ \nagricultural economics. Detailed discussion on economics and profitability\
    \ of IoT solutions \nin the agriculture domain have been addressed by multiple\
    \ studies including (Griffin and \nLowenberg-DeBoer 2005; Griffin et al. 2018;\
    \ Wolfert et al. 2017; Lowenberg-DeBoer et al. \n2000; Schimmelpfennig 2016; Kutter\
    \ et al. 2011).\nAdopting IoT-based FMIS is not trivial and usually requires large\
    \ economic invest-\nments. To justify these up-front investments the return-on-investment\
    \ both with respect to \ncost and quality should be defined. Further, IoT-based\
    \ FMIS potentially requires changes \nto farm equipment or totally new farm equipment.\
    \ Hence, it is important to analyze the \nacceptability and adoption scenarios,\
    \ and provide clear transition strategies for the efficient \nintroduction, usage\
    \ and maintenance of smart farming. Due to space limitations and the \nconcrete\
    \ scope of the paper this is not further discussed.\nA systematic case study research\
    \ has been applied to validate the proposed approach. \nEach empirical study usually\
    \ has to deal with a few potential threats to validity. In the fol-\nlowing these\
    \ are discussed for the presented case study research, and the mitigation strat-\n\
    egy for each threat is described.\nConstruct validity refers to what extent the\
    \ operational measures that are studied really \nrepresent what the researchers\
    \ have in mind and what is investigated according to the \nresearch questions\
    \ (Yin 2009). Table  3 shows various identified threats to construction \nvalidity\
    \ together with the counter measures.\nInternal Validity relates to a causal relationship\
    \ between treatment and the outcome. \nThe retrospective case study relied on\
    \ existing design documentation and related literature. \nThere could be missing\
    \ information in both cases that would affect the outcome. To miti-\ngate this\
    \ threat several iterations were done to derive both the application feature model\
    \ \nand the application architecture. In the prospective case, the lack of proper\
    \ requirements \ndocumentation could have an impact on the derived decisions.\
    \ To mitigate this threat, \nthis has been discussed with the interviewed persons\
    \ in detail and several iterations were \nadopted.\nExternal Validity concerns\
    \ the ability to generalize the results of the study. In the evalu-\nation, both\
    \ a retrospective and prospective case study were adopted derived from differ-\n\
    ent application domains. This was done to support triangulation and likewise extend\
    \ the \nexternal validity. The approach was considered effective for both case\
    \ studies but due to \nthe small number of participants a stronger statement could\
    \ not be provided. In the future \nwork a repetition of this study with multiple\
    \ other case studies with an increased number of \nparticipants would further\
    \ justify the claims of this paper and also support the quantitative \nevaluation.\n\
    Conclusion\nFarm management information systems are being increasingly applied\
    \ in many farming \nsystems. Several architectures for FMISs have been proposed\
    \ in the literature but these \nare usually abstract, and it is not trivial to\
    \ derive the application FMIS architecture for \nthe corresponding context of\
    \ the farm system. This paper has provided an architecture \ndesign method for\
    \ deriving application architectures for FMISs. For this, reference archi-\ntectures\
    \ for IoT and FMIS were adopted, and a novel IoT based FMIS has been defined.\
    \ \nThe architecture design method has been provided for deriving the customized\
    \ application \nFMIS architecture. To support the design of the application architecture\
    \ a domain driven \n953\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\napproach\
    \ has been adopted whereby a family feature diagram was defined representing the\
    \ \ncommon and variant features of IoT based farm management information systems.\
    \ The \napproach was illustrated using a systematic case study approach. Both\
    \ retrospective and \nprospective case studies were implemented including IoT\
    \ based wheat production and IoT \nbased tomato FMIS. The case study research\
    \ showed that the approach was both effective \nand practical. It appeared that\
    \ both the reference architecture that was provided as well as \nthe corresponding\
    \ method appeared to be very useful in deriving the customized applica-\ntion\
    \ FMIS architecture. Since in general developing IoT systems is not trivial adopting\
    \ a \nsystematic approach appears to be useful in not only the final results but\
    \ also the inter-\nmediate steps that support the communication between the stakeholders\
    \ and the overall \nguidance of the design decisions. The contribution of this\
    \ paper can be useful for both \nresearchers who do research on IoT based FMISs\
    \ as well as practitioners who aim to archi-\ntect different FMISs. The future\
    \ work will apply the approach for other farm management \nsystems. Further focus\
    \ will be on the architecture design and integration of multiple differ-\nent\
    \ FMISs.\nOpenAccess This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative\

    Abstract: This paper reviewed a set of twenty-one original and innovative papers\
    \ included in a special\nissue on UAVs for vegetation monitoring, which proposed\
    \ new methods and techniques applied to\ndiverse agricultural and forestry scenarios.\
    \ Three general categories were considered: (1) sensors\nand vegetation indices\
    \ used, (2) technological goals pursued, and (3) agroforestry applications. Some\n\
    investigations focused on issues related to UAV ﬂight operations, spatial resolution\
    \ requirements, and\ncomputation and data analytics, while others studied the\
    \ ability of UAVs for characterizing relevant\nvegetation features (mainly canopy\
    \ cover and crop height) or for detecting different plant/crop\nstressors, such\
    \ as nutrient content/deﬁciencies, water needs, weeds, and diseases. The general\n\
    goal was proposing UAV-based technological solutions for a better use of agricultural\
    \ and forestry\nresources and more efﬁcient production with relevant economic\
    \ and environmental beneﬁts.\nKeywords: drone; RGB; multispectral; hyperspectral;\
    \ thermal; machine learning; water stress;\nnutrient deﬁciency; weed detection;\
    \ disease diagnosis; plant trails\n1. Introduction\nGlobal plant production faces\
    \ the major challenge of sustainability under the constraint\nof a rapidly growing\
    \ world population and the gradual depletion of natural resources.\nIn this context,\
    \ remote sensing can play a fundamental role in changing the production\nmodel\
    \ by developing and implementing new technologies for vegetation monitoring (e.g.,\n\
    advanced sensors and remote platforms, powerful algorithms, etc.) that will lead\
    \ to higher\nyields, while also obtaining more sustainable and environmentally\
    \ friendly food and plant\nproducts [1]. Among the recent innovations, the unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones\nhave demonstrated their suitability for timely\
    \ tracking and assessment of vegetation status\ndue to several advantages, as\
    \ follows: (1) they can operate at low altitudes to provide aerial\nimagery with\
    \ ultra-high spatial resolution allowing detection of ﬁne details of vegetation,\n\
    (2) the ﬂights can be scheduled with great ﬂexibility according to critical moments\
    \ imposed\nby vegetation progress over time, (3) they can use diverse sensors\
    \ and perception systems\nacquiring different ranges of vegetation spectrum (visible,\
    \ infrared, thermal), (4) this\ntechnology can also generate digital surface models\
    \ (DSMs) with three-dimensional (3D)\nmeasurements of vegetation by using highly\
    \ overlapping images and applying photo-\nreconstruction procedures with the structure-from-motion\
    \ (SfM) technique [2]. The UAVs\nare therefore a cost-effective tool for obtaining\
    \ high spatial resolution 3D data of plants\nand trees that are not feasible with\
    \ airborne or satellite platforms [3], ﬁlling the gap\nbetween ground-based devices\
    \ and these other traditional remote sensing systems. In\naddition, the UAV-based\
    \ digital images can be an efﬁcient alternative to data collected\nRemote Sens.\

    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n2 of 13\nwith manual ﬁeldwork, which is often arduous,\
    \ involves destructive sampling, and may\nprovide inconsistent and subjective\
    \ information. As a result of these strengths, the UAVs\nare becoming very suitable\
    \ platforms for agroforestry applications [4,5], such as vegetation\ncharacterization\
    \ and mapping [6], land management [7], environmental monitoring [8],\nand especially\
    \ to address diverse precision agriculture objectives [9] and plant phenotypic\n\
    characterization in breeding programs [10,11].\nThe large amount of detailed data\
    \ embedded in UAV imagery requires the develop-\nment and application of powerful\
    \ analysis procedures capable of extracting information\nrelated to the structural\
    \ and biochemical composition of vegetation that provides a better\nunderstanding\
    \ of relevant plant traits. Traditional statistical analysis, such as linear classi-\n\
    ﬁers, spatial statistics, or extrema estimators, and pixel-based image analysis\
    \ are commonly\nused [12]. However, advanced procedures such as the object-based\
    \ image analysis (OBIA)\nparadigm, computer vision techniques, and machine learning\
    \ algorithms further exploit\nthe advantages of the UAV [13,14], enabling rapid\
    \ and accurate vegetation analysis and,\nconsequently, helping end-users (e.g.,\
    \ farmers, advisors, and public administrations) in the\ndecision-making process\
    \ of agricultural and forestry management.\nGiven the increased interest for new\
    \ investigations and advances in the areas of UAV\ntechnology and UAV-based image\
    \ processing/analysis in agricultural and forest scenarios,\nthis Special Issue\
    \ (SI) collected a set of twenty-one original and innovative articles that\nshowed\
    \ several applications of the UAVs for vegetation monitoring in order to deepen\n\
    our understanding of these ecosystems. The SI includes the recent scientiﬁc contribu-\n\
    tions organized according to three general categories: (1) type of the sensor\
    \ employed\nand, additionally, vegetation index (VI) applied, (2) technological\
    \ goals pursued, in terms\nof UAV conﬁguration and speciﬁcations, and issues related\
    \ to image spatial resolution,\ncomputation, artiﬁcial intelligence, and image\
    \ processing algorithms, and (3) agroforestry\napplications, which involved novel\
    \ UAV-based data-driven approaches for monitoring veg-\netation features in certain\
    \ critical dates, measuring plant trails over time for crop dynamics\nstudies,\
    \ and detecting and modeling biotic (weeds, disease) and abiotic (water, nutrition\
    \ de-\nﬁciencies) stress factors. These three categories shared the common objective\
    \ of proposing\nnew methods and techniques to achieve better use of agricultural\
    \ and forestry resources\nand more efﬁcient production with relevant economic\
    \ and environmental beneﬁts.\n2. Sensors and Vegetation Indices Used\nA wide range\
    \ of sensors is available for vegetation monitoring, which can be grouped\ninto\
    \ visible light (i.e., sensitive to the red, green, blue wavebands, also known\
    \ as RGB\ncameras), multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal. The selection of\
    \ the proper sensor\nshould be made according to speciﬁc agricultural or forestry\
    \ objectives, i.e., for vegetation\ncharacterization (e.g., measuring vegetation\
    \ features and plant traits) or for assessing cer-\ntain variables associated\
    \ to plant production (e.g., nutrient content/deﬁciencies and water\nstress) and\
    \ plant protection (e.g., weed detection and disease diagnosis) issues (Figure\
    \ 1).\nFor example, RGB and multispectral sensors were selected to determine canopy\
    \ cover (CC),\nalso known as fractional canopy/vegetation cover or vegetation\
    \ coverage, where the main\nchallenge consisted of separating vegetation from\
    \ the background by performing simple\nlinear regression models [15–17]. RGB and\
    \ multispectral sensors were used to monitor\ncrop dynamics, as these sensors\
    \ allowed building DEMs through a photogrammetric SfM\nprocess, then calculating\
    \ crop height (CH) values, and ﬁnally performing morphological\nprocedures [18–20].\
    \ These two sensors are cheaper and easier to use than thermal and\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensors, and do not require a complex calibration phase, so they proved to\n\
    be optimal for assessing plant structural traits.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n\
    3 of 13\note Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3  of  13 \n \nFigure 1. Sensors used in the experiments performed in this SI according to agricultural and for‐\n\
    estry objectives.     \nThe RGB and multispectral sensors were also suitable for the target of identifying \n\
    abiotic stress (e.g., Nitrogen (N) content/deficiencies), although this goal required detect‐\n\
    ing subtle changes in leaf pigment contents, for which it is necessary to employ more com‐\n\
    plex  procedures,  such  as  machine  learning  (ML)  or  partial  least  squares \
    \ regressions \n(PLSR) algorithms. Similar approaches were followed for water deficiencies causing ef‐\n\
    fects on chlorophyll content and organization in the mesophyll and leaf structure. It was \n\
    possible to address this goal using RGB and thermal‐based VIs [21] or multispectral sen‐\n\
    sors and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [22]. It is also common to use thermal \n\
    sensors since water stress causes stomatal closure that reduces transpiration and evapo‐\n\
    rative cooling and increases temperature [23]. In this way, data from thermal sensors were \n\
    combined with RGB [21] or multispectral sensors [24,25] to take advantage of the infor‐\n\
    mation provided in different areas of the spectrum and the higher spatial resolution of \n\
    such sensors.   \nRegarding the assessment of plant biotic stress, the RGB sensors were used to detect \n\
    weed patches at mid‐ to late‐season using CNN models [26]. However, narrower band‐\n\
    width spectral data were required to detect changes in the biochemical and biophysical \n\
    parameters caused by diseases and, in some cases, texture features (TFs) to improve the \n\
    diagnosis accuracy. Thus, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors were used for mapping \n\
    disease occurrence [27–29]. The red‐edge information was also relevant for this goal, so \n\
    regardless of the sensor selected, the images should contain information in this specific \n\
    spectral region. \nIt is worth noting that vegetation indices (VIs) were also widely used in many inves‐\n\
    tigations on vegetation monitoring (Table 1), as they enhance the spectral differences of \n\
    vegetation at specific wavelengths. The applications of the VIs used in this SI are discussed \n\
    further in Section 4. \nTable 1. Vegetation indices (VIs) applied in the papers published in this special issue. \n\

    \ and forestry objectives.\nThe RGB and multispectral sensors were also suitable\
    \ for the target of identifying\nabiotic stress (e.g., Nitrogen (N) content/deﬁciencies),\
    \ although this goal required detecting\nsubtle changes in leaf pigment contents,\
    \ for which it is necessary to employ more complex\nprocedures, such as machine\
    \ learning (ML) or partial least squares regressions (PLSR)\nalgorithms. Similar\
    \ approaches were followed for water deﬁciencies causing effects on\nchlorophyll\
    \ content and organization in the mesophyll and leaf structure. It was possible\n\
    to address this goal using RGB and thermal-based VIs [21] or multispectral sensors\
    \ and\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) [22]. It is also common to use thermal\
    \ sensors since\nwater stress causes stomatal closure that reduces transpiration\
    \ and evaporative cooling and\nincreases temperature [23]. In this way, data from\
    \ thermal sensors were combined with\nRGB [21] or multispectral sensors [24,25]\
    \ to take advantage of the information provided in\ndifferent areas of the spectrum\
    \ and the higher spatial resolution of such sensors.\nRegarding the assessment\
    \ of plant biotic stress, the RGB sensors were used to detect\nweed patches at\
    \ mid- to late-season using CNN models [26]. However, narrower band-\nwidth spectral\
    \ data were required to detect changes in the biochemical and biophysical\nparameters\
    \ caused by diseases and, in some cases, texture features (TFs) to improve the\n\
    diagnosis accuracy. Thus, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors were used for\
    \ mapping\ndisease occurrence [27–29]. The red-edge information was also relevant\
    \ for this goal, so\nregardless of the sensor selected, the images should contain\
    \ information in this speciﬁc\nspectral region.\nIt is worth noting that vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) were also widely used in many inves-\ntigations on vegetation\
    \ monitoring (Table 1), as they enhance the spectral differences of\nvegetation\
    \ at speciﬁc wavelengths. The applications of the VIs used in this SI are discussed\n\
    further in Section 4.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n4 of 13\nTable 1. Vegetation\

    Development and validation of new technologies and computational procedures for\n\
    vegetation monitoring requires the deﬁnition of the optimal ﬂight and sensor conﬁguration,\n\
    appropriate data format, workﬂow speciﬁcations, and innovative analysis methods\
    \ that\nlead to the generation of scientiﬁc knowledge on vegetation condition\
    \ and management.\nTherefore, this section describes the contributions partially\
    \ or entirely focused to techno-\nlogical goals, including issues on UAV ﬂight\
    \ operations, spatial resolution requirements,\nand computation and data analytics.\n\
    3.1. UAV Flight Operations\nUAV ﬂight is the ﬁrst step for image acquisition.\
    \ Designing a UAV route, i.e., a\nmission planning or a ﬂight planning, is a critical\
    \ task requiring several parameters. The\nquality and viability of acquired imagery\
    \ and data will largely depend on those operation\nparameters and on how the ﬂights\
    \ are performed. The conﬁguration of ﬂight mission\nand the speciﬁcations of the\
    \ UAV employed must be evaluated in detail and adapted to\neach speciﬁc objective,\
    \ particularity in the case of agronomical applications [32]. In this\nregard,\
    \ Jiang et al. (2020) [31] evaluated the inﬂuence of ﬂight altitude, solar zenith\
    \ angle\n(SZA), and time of day (TOD) for NDVI calculation at different paddy\
    \ rice growth levels.\nThe results indicated that both SZA and TOD—which is logical\
    \ since SZAs depend on\nthe TOD—had the most signiﬁcant impact on estimated NDVI\
    \ values following a directly\nproportional relation. For a ﬂight altitude below\
    \ 100 m, the correlation with estimated\nNDVI was inversely proportional for maximum\
    \ and mean values, while minimum NDVIs\nincreased with higher ﬂight altitude values.\
    \ In addition, the most accurate reﬂectivity, and\nthus the estimated NDVI values,\
    \ were achieved at the smaller SZA.\nThe UAVs can also suffer from stability problems,\
    \ such as shaking or imprecise ge-\nographic coordinates (X-Y), which are more\
    \ pronounced when UAV is piloted manually.\nThey are caused by wind perturbations\
    \ or improper attitude stabilization, resulting in geo-\nreferencing problems\
    \ with consequent complications for vegetation mapping. Therefore,\nit is important\
    \ to ensure a robust stabilization system that provides high-quality image\ndata\
    \ and, thus, improves the precision of the image registration algorithms. Colorado\
    \ et al.\n(2020) [30] developed a novel UAV stabilization control called BS+DAF\
    \ (backstepping +\ndesired angular acceleration function) to reduce angular wind-induced\
    \ disturbances. The\nBS+DAF consisted of a nonlinear trajectory-tracking controller\
    \ that adds aerodynamics\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n5 of 13\ninformation to\
    \ control yaw, producing roll and pitch acceleration commands to reduce\nsudden\
    \ angular acceleration changes due to external perturbations as those caused by\n\
    wind. Therefore, precise angular stabilization can be maintained during ﬂight,\
    \ resulting in\na more quality image acquisition and registration. These authors\
    \ also proved that better\ncorrelations in canopy N estimations were obtained\
    \ when the BS+DAF controller was\nimplemented in the UAV ﬂights.\n3.2. Spatial\
    \ Resolution Requeriments\nFlight altitude is a critical parameter in remote image\
    \ acquisition, as it has strong\nimplications in image spatial resolution, ﬂight\
    \ duration, spatial coverage, and computa-\ntional cost of the image processing\
    \ tasks [33,34]. Lower altitudes result in images with ﬁner\nspatial resolution,\
    \ but require longer ﬂights and demand higher computational times for\nimage processing\
    \ [35]. Therefore, evaluation of ﬂight altitude and spatial resolution was a\n\
    central point in some investigations of this SI [16,24,27,29,36], being a usual\
    \ objective to\nresample UAV images to spatial resolutions similar to those of\
    \ common satellites, e.g., 5 m\nof Rapideye, 10 m of Sentinel-2, and 30 m of LANDSAT,\
    \ in order to study the potential\nof using such satellite platforms instead of\
    \ UAV for speciﬁc agro-forestry goals. Thus,\nIizuka et al. (2019) [16] discovered\
    \ that CC estimation was affected by spatial resolution\nand coarser resolutions\
    \ showed stronger correlation with manually delineated data in an\nRGB orthomosaic,\
    \ concluding that the satellite images could be feasible for this purpose.\nThese\
    \ authors explained that variability decreases when ﬁner data is aggregated to\
    \ a larger\nunit, thus increasing correlations. However, Nassar et al. (2020)\
    \ [24] demonstrated that\na very high spatial resolution is necessary to use the\
    \ Two-Source Energy Balance with a\ndual temperature (TSEB2T) model for successfully\
    \ estimating evapotranspiration (ET). The\nauthors argued that the selected spatial\
    \ resolution should be ﬁne enough to discriminate\nplant canopy and soil temperature,\
    \ as they evaluated multiple spatial domain scales (3.6,\n7.2, 14.4, and 30 m),\
    \ leading them to conclude that the current satellites were not suitable for\n\
    this application, especially those with spatial resolution of 30 m or broader,\
    \ e.g., Landsat.\nImage resampling approaches were also carried out in experiments\
    \ for disease detec-\ntion, where spatial resolution is a crucial factor as disease-induced\
    \ biological symptoms\nare subtle and only detectable at high resolution values.\
    \ Thus, Guo et al. (2021) [29] and Ye\net al. (2020) [27] evaluated several pixel\
    \ sizes to select the optimal resolution for mapping\ndisease areas, yielding\
    \ 0.01 m for yellow rust in wheat and a minimum of 0.5 m in the\ncase of Fusarium\
    \ wilt in banana, respectively. In addition, Zhang et al. (2020) [36] explored\n\
    the inﬂuence of image spatial resolution on the segmentation process prior to\
    \ identify\nN deﬁciency in rapeseed ﬁelds, concluding that the optimal value by\
    \ using the U-Net\nconvolutional neural network architecture will depend on the\
    \ target size and stating an\nappropriate patch size of 256x256 pixels in the\
    \ purple rapeseed leaves.\n3.3. Computation and Data Analytics\nInnovations in\
    \ data analytics are also contributing to overcome diverse challenges\nin agroforestry\
    \ scenarios, especially regarding to the implementation of computational\nadvances\
    \ that speed up the processing times and of new algorithms that provide timely\
    \ and\naccurate analysis to assist in complex studies and decision-making processes.\
    \ One of the\ndisciplines most involved in this progress is artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) and, in particular, ML\ntools such as support vector machine (SVM), random\
    \ forest (RF), and CNNs algorithms that\ncan solve complex matters using datasets\
    \ from multiple sources and helping to discover\nhidden rules and patterns in\
    \ such large datasets.\nMachefer et al. (2020) [37] developed a novel algorithm\
    \ for counting and sizing potato\nand lettuce plants based on a deep learning\
    \ (DL) approach. Their all-in-one algorithm\nwas an adaptation of Mask R-CNN architecture\
    \ that combined segmentation, plant de-\nlineation and counting tasks, avoiding\
    \ an additional ”patching” step and simplifying the\ncomputational complexity.\
    \ This approach was compared to a computer vision baseline\nshowing better accuracy\
    \ results for CNN-based method in both crops. Another example of\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2021, 13, 2139\n6 of 13\nML techniques was applied by Fu et al. (2021) [38],\
    \ who estimated winter wheat biomass\nduring several growth stages using multiscale\
    \ spectral features and TFs and least squares\nsupport vector machine (LSSVM)\
    \ and partial least squares regressions (PLSR) analysis\nalgorithms. The authors\
    \ determined the optimal TFs for biomass estimation by combining\ntwo-dimensional\
    \ (2D) Gabor ﬁlters and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) analyses.\nThe\
    \ author argued that this method performed better using multiscale textures than\
    \ single-\nscale textures, and concluded that biomass estimation did not signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve using\nhyperspectral data, showing that LSSVM regression with proper\
    \ multiscale textural fea-\ntures was an optimal and simpler alternative to hyperspectral-based\
    \ methods. Bhatnagar\net al. (2020) [39] also compared several ML models, but\
    \ included DL and segmentation\nalgorithms to map raised bog vegetation communities\
    \ using RGB and TFs. Based on these\nperformances, RF with graph cut as segmentation\
    \ technique was selected as the best ML\nclassiﬁer. The ResNet50 CNN with the\
    \ SegNet semantic segmentation architecture was\nselected for DL. Although slightly\
    \ better accuracy was reached with ResNet50- SegNet,\nthese authors recommended\
    \ RF-graph cut for ecotopes mapping, as DL required more\ndataset training, computation\
    \ time, and hardware power.\n4. Research Focused to Agroforestry Applications\n\
    4.1. Assessment of Vegetation Features\nCanopy cover (CC), or the proportion of\
    \ unit area covered by the vertical projection of\nplant canopy, is an important\
    \ indicator of plant development, biomass, light interception,\nphotosynthesis\
    \ activity, and evapotranspiration partitioning [40,41]. Since CC has tradition-\n\
    ally been determined using tedious and imprecise manual procedures, the development\
    \ of\nan accurate and rapid remote-sensing based tool to measure this vegetation\
    \ feature has\nbeen often a goal in agroforestry. In addition, UAV imagery can\
    \ generate DSMs and 3D\npoint clouds using photo-reconstruction and artiﬁcial\
    \ vision techniques to provide the\nheight information (or Z-value) at each coordinate\
    \ (X,Y) as a basis for calculating the CH\nvalues of vegetation. Thus, this SI\
    \ reports on several studies to assess these features and its\ntemporal variation\
    \ over the growing season for monitoring vegetation or crop dynamics\nwith UAV-based\
    \ RGB and multispectral images [15–20].\nAshapure et al. (2019) [15] computed\
    \ CC over the cotton growing season using a\nmodel that combined an RGB-based\
    \ VI with a morphological closing tool, which consisted\nof a combined dilation\
    \ and erosion operation to remove the small holes, while keeping\nthe separation\
    \ boundary intact. The RGBVI was selected to be the most efﬁcient VI for\nthis\
    \ purpose. These authors showed that the CC estimation model based VI alone was\n\
    very unstable and failed to identify the canopy when the cotton leaves changed\
    \ color after\nripening. However, applying a morphological closure operation signiﬁcantly\
    \ improved\nthe estimation, which led them to conclude that the proposed RGB-based\
    \ CC model\nprovides an affordable alternative to multispectral-based approaches,\
    \ which rely on more\nsophisticated and expensive sensors.\nIn other study, Iizuka\
    \ et al. (2019) [16] employed RGB and multispectral data to\ncompute CC of several\
    \ land uses/land covers in Indonesia peatland forest, including\nAcacia trees\
    \ and other types of forests with rapid land transitions. The ﬁrst step consisted\
    \ of\ngenerating a map of land uses by applying the Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP)\
    \ classiﬁcation\nto the RGB images. Then, the VI that best computed the CC for\
    \ each land use was\nselected, resulting in ReNDVI for Acacia and NDVI for grass/shrubs\
    \ and non-vegetation\nclasses. These authors stated that UAVs’ multispectral information\
    \ can quickly quantify\nCC in tropical forests, especially those of fast-growing\
    \ Acacia that can rapidly change\nland conditions.\nFollowing a similar approach,\
    \ Lima-Cueto et al. (2019) [17] quantiﬁed CC in olive\norchards, where cover crops\
    \ are a critical agro-environmental conservation technique\nfor improving soil\
    \ fertility and water retention, as well as reducing water erosion. They\nemployed\
    \ a multispectral sensor to calculate VIs related to ground-truth cover crops\
    \ at\ndifferent densities. They showed that the capacity of the evaluated VIs\
    \ to quantiﬁed\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n7 of 13\nCC depends on the amount\
    \ of cover crops and the range of cover density intervals, i.e.,\nthe width of\
    \ the intervals into which the complete series of densities was divided. This\n\
    investigation reported the IRVI as the most sensitive VI for a cover interval\
    \ range of 15–\n25%, although the IRVI, NRVI, NDVI, GNDVI, and SAVI were valid\
    \ for differentiating the\ncomplete series of densities when the interval rose\
    \ to 30%.\nBorra-Serrano et al. (2020) [18] combined multi-temporal RGB-UAV data\
    \ with curve\nﬁtting to obtain biologically interpretable parameters of a large\
    \ set of soybean genotypes\nand derived phenotypic parameters like growth rate,\
    \ weed suppression, determinacy,\nand senescence. First, CC and CH were estimated\
    \ from each ﬂight date based on the\nExG and the 90th percentile of the crop height\
    \ model (CHM) values, respectively. Then,\nmulti-temporal data were adjusted to\
    \ the sigmoid growth functions Gompertz for CC\nand Beta for CH. In addition,\
    \ these authors developed a model to predict seed yield for\nestimating full maturity,\
    \ i.e., when each accession reached the R8 stage.\nHeidarian Dehkordi et al. (2020)\
    \ [19] shown another approach to extract multi-\ntemporal CC and CH from several\
    \ VI and CHM, respectively. These authors also derived\ncrop growth and health\
    \ maps from RGB and multispectral images by K-means algorithms.\nThese maps were\
    \ used to monitor crop dynamics and assess century-old biochar’s impacts\non winter\
    \ wheat crop performance at the canopy scale over the growing season. In addition,\n\
    they studied the impact on the predicted multispectral crop yield based on the\
    \ s-CCI and\nthe NDRE indices (Table 1), which exhibited a signiﬁcant correlation\
    \ with crop harvest data.\nTheir results showed a signiﬁcant positive impact of\
    \ century-old biochar on the winter\nwheat CC and CH over time, but no impact\
    \ on harvested crop yield was found.\nZan et al. (2020) [20] showed another example\
    \ of monitoring crop dynamic from RGB-\nUAV imagery with a method to detect and\
    \ quantify maize tassels in the ﬂowering stage by\ncombining machine learning\
    \ algorithms and morphological methods. Once the RGB images\nwere taken, a RF\
    \ algorithm was used to identify and classify tassel pixels, ﬁnding tassels of\n\
    any size and unconnected regions. A reﬁning process based on morphological procedures\n\
    was performed to remove small objects and to connect pixels producing potential\
    \ tassel\nregion candidates. Then, VGG16 neural network was used to remove false\
    \ positives. Their\nresults showed that the tassel can be detected at any stages,\
    \ although the accuracy was\naffected by the tasseling development, reporting\
    \ higher accuracy for late tasseling than for\nmiddle and early stages. Finally,\
    \ these authors also calculated the tassel branch number by\nan endpoint detection\
    \ method based on the tassel skeleton.\n4.2. Evaluation of Stressor on Vegetation\n\
    The biotic and abiotic stressors such as nutrition and water deﬁciencies and pests\n\
    (including plagues, diseases, and weeds) can drastically reduce the quality and\
    \ quantity of\nvegetation production and crop yield. In fact, the overall impact\
    \ of the pathogens affecting\ncrop health is estimated to reduce global production\
    \ by about 40% [42]. The stress factors\ncause changes in plant physiology and\
    \ morphology that result in variations in canopy\nreﬂectance that can be potentially\
    \ monitored with UAVs and imaging sensors [43,44].\nTherefore, this SI collected\
    \ papers on the use of UAVs to assess those factors affecting\nboth crop production\
    \ (e.g., N content/deﬁciencies and water stress/needs) and crop\nprotection (weed\
    \ and disease detection/diagnosis) aspects. Many of the cited papers\nutilized\
    \ the vegetation features mentioned in the point 4.1., together with various data\n\
    analytic approaches mentioned in the point 3.3.\n4.2.1. Assessment of Nitrogen\
    \ Content/Deﬁciencies\nNitrogen is an essential plant nutrient for the growth\
    \ and yield of crops. Leaf N\nis directly related to the chlorophyll content,\
    \ which is a key indicator of photosynthetic\ncapacity and nutrient status. Zhang\
    \ et al. (2020) [36] developed a method to monitor crop\nN stress in winter oilseed\
    \ rape using UAV RGB imagery and ML-based segmentation. Their\nmethod consisted\
    \ in discriminating the rapeseed leaves with purple color, a symptom of\nN deﬁciency,\
    \ using a binary semantic segmentation process and, then, relating the purple\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n8 of 13\nleaf area ratio to the N content of the\
    \ plants. The authors tested ﬁve image segmentation\napproaches at the pixel level\
    \ for the extraction of the purple rapeseed leaves during the\nseedling stage.\
    \ The CNN U-Net model with a patch size of 256 x 256 pixels reported the\nbest\
    \ results. A negative exponential regression analysis was established between\
    \ measured\nN content and estimated purple leaf ratios (leaf pixels over the total\
    \ pixels) under four\nN application levels. This method proved to be sensitive\
    \ to low-medium N application;\nhowever, the sensitivity was reduced for N levels\
    \ over 150 kg/ha.\nA ML approach was also employed by Colorado et al. (2020) [30]\
    \ to monitor canopy\nN in rice crops with multispectral UAV imagery. The approach\
    \ was evaluated during\nthe dry season at three rice growth stages: vegetative,\
    \ reproductive, and ripening. As\na preliminary phase, the authors proposed an\
    \ automated GrabCut image segmentation\nmethod, which is an improvement of the\
    \ regular GrabCut one [45], that adds a guided\nﬁltering reﬁnement step to extract\
    \ the rice canopy pixel data. Next, several ML algorithms\naccurately correlated\
    \ ground-truth leaf chlorophyll measurements and canopy N estimates\nvia VIs.\
    \ The successful ML algorithms were multi-variable linear regressions (MLR), SVM,\n\
    and artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), which showed that MSAVI, GNDVI, and NDVI\
    \ have\na strong correlation with canopy N at any growth stages. Finally, the\
    \ authors also proved\nthat these good correlations improve with the implementation\
    \ of a stabilization control\nduring UAV ﬂight operations.\nSimilarly, Qiao et\
    \ al. (2020) [46] described a segmentation-based method to estimate\nchlorophyll\
    \ content at different maize growth stages using multispectral imagery. They\n\
    showed different segmentation results that produced variations in the extraction\
    \ of maize\ncanopy parameters, with the wavelet method as the best output. Next,\
    \ a maize canopy\nchlorophyll content model was developed using VIs from the segmented\
    \ images. The re-\nsearch demonstrated the importance of image segmentation to\
    \ remove the soil background\nand highlight the spectral reﬂectance of crop canopy\
    \ for N detection purposes.\n4.2.2. Assessment of Water Stress\nFresh water is\
    \ a ﬁnite and scarce resource in many regions of the world. Therefore,\ndetermining\
    \ how much water the plant needs is crucial for efﬁcient crop, water, and\nirrigation\
    \ management. Freeman et al. (2019) [22] used multispectral images and cloud-\n\
    based artiﬁcial intelligence for the early detection of water stress in ornamental\
    \ horticultural\nplants. Images containing the plants in three types of water\
    \ stress situations (high, low, and\nnon-stressed) were analyzed by the IBM Watson\
    \ Visual Recognition platform, a deep CNN\nhosted in the cloud. The generated\
    \ models were able to identify the plants with early water\nstress, i.e., after\
    \ 48 hours of water deprivation in most of the studied species. In addition,\n\
    early indicators of stress after 24 hours of water suppression were found for\
    \ the Buddleia\nplants. This research opens up the opportunity of identifying\
    \ water needs in large datasets\nthrough cloud-hosted artiﬁcial intelligence services.\n\
    De Swaef et al. (2021) [21] evaluated the drought tolerance of three common types\n\
    of forage species (Festuca arundinacea, diploid, and tetraploid Lolium perenne)\
    \ with VIs\nfrom RGB and thermal imaging. The methodology was tested in ﬁve UAV\
    \ ﬂight dates\nthroughout the summer, which overlapped with visual breeder score-taking.\
    \ Pearson\ncorrelation showed better results between breeder scores and visual-based\
    \ VIs than with\nthermal indices, with H from the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color\
    \ space and NDLab\nfrom CIELab color space (Table 1) being the best. These VIs\
    \ and MGRVI also displayed\nbroad-sense high heritability, i.e., the total variation\
    \ proportion that may be attributed to\ngenotype variation. This research showed\
    \ the use of UAV-based RGB-VIs as an efﬁcient\nalternative to breeder scores for\
    \ drought tolerance.\nIn other research conducted by Ellsäßer et al. (2020) [25],\
    \ RGB and thermal UAV\nimagery and meteorological data were used to estimate sap\
    \ ﬂux and leaf stomatal conduc-\ntance, key inputs for water balance, and plant\
    \ transpiration assessments. The experiment\nwas conducted in an oil palm plantation,\
    \ where oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and other\nseveral forest tree species (Peronema\
    \ canescens, Archidendron pauciﬂorum, Parkia speciosa, and\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 2139\n9 of 13\nShorea leprosula) usually appear. These authors tested linear\
    \ statistical and ML approaches\nto build the prediction models using in-situ\
    \ measured transpiration and estimated data.\nFor both parameters, RF model achieved\
    \ the best accuracy, being less robust for stomatal\nconductance. R2 values for\
    \ sap ﬂux prediction were close to or higher than 0.8 for forest\nspecies and\
    \ 0.58 for palms, however, the model accuracies were moderate (60%) and low\n\
    (38%) for forest species and palms, respectively. Therefore, image-based variables\
    \ and\nmeteorological observations used as input to the RF algorithm could be\
    \ an alternative to\nsap ﬂux manual measurements only for same of the evaluated\
    \ species, especially Parkia\nspeciosa and Archidendron pauciﬂorum.\nIn order\
    \ to model the radiative and convective ﬂux exchanges between soil and\ncanopy\
    \ for ET estimation, Nassar et al. (2020) [24] tested the TSEB2T model in vineyard\n\
    using multispectral and thermal images, including a step of mapping canopy and\
    \ soil\ntemperature. The TSEB2T inputs were calculated from images, as follows:\
    \ Leaf Area Index\n(LAI) using a genetic programming model and ground measurements,\
    \ CH extracted from\nthe DSM and DTM, CC and canopy width (CW) based on NDVI imagery,\
    \ and canopy\nand soil/substrate temperature (Tc and Ts, respectively) by averaging\
    \ the temperature of\npixels classiﬁed as pure soil and pure canopy based on a\
    \ linear land surface temperature\n(LST)-NDVI model. The validation results showed\
    \ a close agreement of TSEB2T output and\nground-truth measurements if spatial\
    \ image resolution was high enough to discriminate\nplant canopy and soil temperatures.\n\
    4.2.3. Weed Detection and Mapping\nWeeds compete with crops for soil resources,\
    \ thus reducing crop yield and creating a\nweed seed bank that germinates the\
    \ following season, increasing the weed-crop competition\nproblem. Weeds are often\
    \ distributed in patches within ﬁelds, which allows designing\nsite-speciﬁc weed\
    \ management (SSWM) strategies to adjust applications according to the\nweed patches\
    \ distribution [47]. In this area, Veeranampalayam et al. (2020) [26] evaluated\n\
    two objects detection-based CNN models and RGB images for mid-to-late season weed\n\
    identiﬁcation in soybean ﬁelds. Two feature extractors were also evaluated in\
    \ both NN\nmodels, (Faster RCNN and the Single Shot Detector (SSD)), concluding\
    \ that Inception v2\nperforms better than Mobilenet v2. Moreover, the result showed\
    \ that Faster RCNN is the\nbest NN model in terms of weed detection accuracy and\
    \ inference time compared to SDD\nand the patch-based CNN, a pre-trained network\
    \ used for validation. Therefore, due to the\nrapid and accurate performance for\
    \ weed detection at mid-late stage, Faster RCNN proves\nto be a suitable solution\
    \ for near real-time weed detection. A process improvement could\nconsist of removing\
    \ manual tasks by using OBIA multiresolution segmentation approach\ninstead, thus\
    \ automating the process, leading to a real-time processing.\n4.2.4. Disease Detection/Diagnosis\n\
    Numerous studies on disease detection have been carried out at the leaf scale\
    \ [48];\nhowever, more research needs to scale up at the canopy level to monitor\
    \ disease in large\nareas. Mapping at the ﬁeld scale would control disease effects\
    \ through proper management\nstrategies, such as site-speciﬁc control tactics.\
    \ Ye et al. (2020) [27] established a method\nfor mapping Fusarium wilt in bananas\
    \ with multispectral imagery and VIs. Once the more\nsuitable VIs were selected\
    \ based on an independent t-test analysis, the Binary Logistic\nRegression (BLR)\
    \ method was used to relate healthy and infested samples for each selected\nVIs.\
    \ The CIgreen, CIRE, NDVI, and NDRE indices (Table 1) were able to identify healthy\n\
    and diseased trees, with CIRE exhibiting the best performance. Infestation maps\
    \ were\nperformed with the BLR equation obtained for CIRE. Moreover, the importance\
    \ of the\nred-edge information in the discrimination was highlighted.\nWang et\
    \ al. (2020) [28] developed a non-supervised method for cotton root rot (CRR)\n\
    detection with the novelty of the individual identiﬁcation of CRR-infected plants\
    \ using\nmultispectral images. This plant-by-plant (PBP) method consists of a\
    \ segmentation pro-\ncess based on the Superpixel algorithm, which creates multi-pixel\
    \ pieces (super-pixel),\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n10 of 13\napproximately\
    \ single plant zones, based on shape, color, texture, etc. Then, a classiﬁcation\n\
    was performed using k-means algorithms to achieve a two-class super-pixel classiﬁcation,\n\
    i.e., CRR and healthy zones. The results highlighted the importance of the segmentation\n\
    process, as the accuracy increased when it was carried out as a prior step to\
    \ the classiﬁ-\ncation phase. Compared to conventional supervised methods, the\
    \ PBP achieved better\nclassiﬁcations with the best accuracy parameters in terms\
    \ of overall accuracy, kappa coefﬁ-\ncient and commission errors, and high values\
    \ in the omission errors. Also, the fungicide\ntreatment based on the PBP-infestation\
    \ map allowed a high-precision treatment of CRR\nwith a mortality percentage similar\
    \ to conventional treatment rates.\nFinally, Guo et al. (2021) [29] added TFs\
    \ to VIs extracted from the hyperspectral images\nto address the wheat yellow\
    \ rust mapping at different infection stages. To develop the\nPLSR model for each\
    \ infection stage, VIs, TFs, and a combination of them were tested and\ncompared\
    \ to ground truth severity data described by the disease index (DI). Finally,\
    \ the VI-\nTF combination, composed of mean (MEA1 and MEA2), variance (VAR2),\
    \ contrast (CON2),\nNDVI, SIPI, PRI, PSRI, and MSR, was selected for the PLSR\
    \ model performance in each\ninfection period, as they achieved the highest accuracy\
    \ in every stage. The performance\naccuracy was affected by the infection stage,\
    \ such that the infection period increased,\nmonitoring accuracy increased, with\
    \ high values for mid- and late-infection periods, and\npoor for early ones. Thus,\
    \ wheat yellow rust infestation maps could be created based on\nthe PLSR model\
    \ and the VIs and TF selected.\n5. Conclusions\nThe investigations included in\
    \ this SI proved the wide scope of UAVs in very diverse\napplications, both in\
    \ agricultural and forestry scenarios, ranging from the characterization\nof relevant\
    \ vegetation features to the detection of plant/crop stressors.\nThe RGB and multispectral\
    \ sensors were particularly effective for assessing canopy\ncover, crop height,\
    \ growth rate, determinacy, senescence, and maize tassel branch number,\namong\
    \ other plant traits. The studies with multispectral sensors also revealed the\
    \ best\nvegetation indices for assessing stresses caused by nutrients and water\
    \ (e.g., NDVI) or by\nbiological agents such as weeds and diseases (e.g., NDRE,\
    \ CIgreen). The hyperspectral\nsensors were focused on disease detection, given\
    \ the ability of these sensors to observe\nspectral differences at certain wavelengths\
    \ that are sensitive to biochemical and biophysical\nchanges caused by plant disease.\
    \ Finally, the research applied the thermal sensors mainly\nfor water stress measures,\
    \ aiming to develop efﬁcient irrigation systems by optimizing\nwater use at the\
    \ crop ﬁeld scale.\nA detailed reading of this SI leads us to note some limitations\
    \ and opportunities\nof UAVs for vegetation monitoring. UAVs can acquire immense\
    \ spatial and temporal\ninformation of crops and forest areas, although they cannot\
    \ currently measure all the\ndesired plant traits, most of the measurements being\
    \ indirect and requiring a rigorous\ncalibration process. Data calibration with\
    \ downwelling/incident light sensors has already\nbeen standardized for multispectral\
    \ sensors, but there is not a good solution for thermal\ncameras yet. In addition,\
    \ there is a problem of ﬂight length and battery duration in UAVs for\nlarge areas,\
    \ so in such cases it could be proposed solutions combined with satellite imagery.\n\
    The coarser spatial resolution of such images could be an obstacle in certain\
    \ applications,\nso new studies combining both UAV and satellite platforms should\
    \ be pursued.\nRegarding data analytics, the machine/deep learning (ML/DL) algorithms\
    \ are be-\ncoming increasingly popular in vegetation characterization, although\
    \ the large amount of\ntraining data they require, as well as their high computational\
    \ cost, should be carefully con-\nsidered. Therefore, such powerful methods may\
    \ not be really necessary in all applications,\nand in any case, it would be interesting\
    \ to deepen into generalization issues, i.e., the use of\ntraining data from speciﬁc\
    \ locations in other scenes or environments, thus making better\nuse of the data\
    \ obtained. In this respect, it would be beneﬁcial to adapt the scientiﬁc proce-\n\
    dures presented here to simpler analytical packages and easy-to-use tools for\
    \ everyone (not\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 2139\n11 of 13\nonly for remote sensing\
    \ and data science researchers), thus widening the opportunities for\nvegetation\
    \ monitoring and crop/forest management from a practical perspective.\nAuthor\

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\

    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\
    \ land is restricted by various factors such as\nland and climate patterns, population\
    \ density, and rapid urbanization, which are constantly\nposing threats to the\
    \ availability of arable land [5]. To illustrate, in 1991, the total arable\n\
    area for food production was 19.5 million square miles (39.47% of the world’s\
    \ land area),\nwhich was reduced to approximately 18.6 million square miles (37.73%\
    \ of the world’s land\narea) in 2013 [6]. Thus, the gap between the demand and\
    \ supply of food is becoming\nmore signiﬁcant and alarming as time progresses.\
    \ Therefore, authors in the literature [7,8]\nemphasize the signiﬁcance of enhancing\
    \ farm management by using scientiﬁc strategies\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908.\

    \ which, in turn, drastically boost crop productivity\nand help in saving natural\
    \ resources [9,10].\nIn recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),\
    \ researchers, engineers, and\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing\
    \ advanced technology to achieve\na better life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows\
    \ [11,12]. One of those pillars of 4IR is IoT,\nwhich is considered as the fuel\
    \ of the 4IR since it contributes effectively by linking trillions\nof objects\
    \ and sensors, all of which generate real-time data. It is expected that around\n\
    100 billion devices have been connected to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This\
    \ number will\nfurther increase since the IoT is progressively entering a wide\
    \ array of sectors and indus-\ntries, ranging from manufacturing, health, communications,\
    \ and energy to the agricultural\nindustry [15]. In an agricultural environment,\
    \ for instance, IoT technology has been uti-\nlized to deal with distributed data\
    \ collection from farming environments and, important\nfor directing farmers,\
    \ with real-time information of the farming ﬁeld [16]. On the other\nhand, integration\
    \ between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracts researchers’\nattention\
    \ for various reasons. UAVs’ reliability, ﬂexibility, portability, line of sight\
    \ (LoS)\nconnectivity, efﬁciency, applicability, rapid deployment, and low maintenance\
    \ cost are valid\nreasons for considering such a technology. UAVs cover a wide\
    \ range of platforms, from\ndrones to high altitude platforms (HAPs), low altitude\
    \ platforms (LAPs), or tethered plat-\nforms [17,18]. UAVs have drawn tremendous\
    \ attention, both in the industry and academia,\ndue to their advantages and wide\
    \ applications [19]. For example, telecommunications,\nmonitor disaster-relief\
    \ missions, empowering smart cities, atmospheric studies, service\ndelivery, surveillance,\
    \ high-resolution imaging, and military applications [20,21].\nSustainability\

    \ Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa)-based\nIoT platform for Smart Farming Modular\
    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\

    \ in a real farm in Italy, where it collected environmental data\n(air, soil,\
    \ temperature, and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (e.g., grapes\n\
    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ 2021, 13, 5908\n7 of 26\nThis paper is motivated to present a low-cost platform\
    \ for comprehensive environ-\nmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This\
    \ integration between IoT and drone\nis also coupled with cloud computing technology,\
    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\
    \ crop productivity and farm management in a\ncost-effective, and timely manner.\n\
    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\
    \ the cloud\nfor storage, analysis, and monitor the status of crops and farms.\
    \ The proposed platform\nis based on experimental work to fulﬁll the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time\nmonitoring of the environmental parameters for 12\
    \ months. Thus, a clear picture can be\nobtained to make wise decisions in managing\
    \ the crop and enhancing its productivity.\nThis integrated system of multiple\
    \ technologies used in the proposed platform develops\ncomprehensive under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors, along with considering an optimized\npropagation path loss,\
    \ which is a noteworthy shift from existing works. In this context and\nto achieve\
    \ the paper’s aim, the following research objectives need to be pursued:\nO1.\n\
    Identiﬁcation of environmental parameters affecting crop productivity;\nO2.\n\
    Selection of a propagation model that is suitable for smart farming;\nO3.\nHardware\
    \ calibration of related devices for experimental work;\nO4.\nImplementation of\
    \ the proposed platform and testing ti in a real scenario;\nO5.\nAnalyzing ﬁndings\
    \ and drawing smart action plans to help in precision agriculture.\n3. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the architecture of the platform, which aims\
    \ to monitor using\nboth under- and aboveground sensors and a drone for smart\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows\nthe conceptual work in a bird’s-eye view of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which consists of\nspace segment and ground segment. The space\
    \ segment comprises the drone, with its\npayloads including the camera, and LoRa\
    \ module, which is responsible for collecting data\nfrom a wireless server gateway\
    \ and then transmitting them to the cloud for storage and\nfurther analysis. The\
    \ ground segment contains three parts: (1) ground control station that\nis controlled\
    \ by the end user; (2) underground sensors gateway node that collects data\nfrom\
    \ underground sensors (soil moisture); and (3) HOBO U30 Weather Station Starter\n\
    Kit, which is an aboveground sensor that measures temperature/humidity, rain,\
    \ and solar\nradiation. Clearly, in the proposed platform architecture, the drone\
    \ acts as a focal point\nbetween ground devices including sensors, relays, and\
    \ gateways, on the one hand, and\ncloud, on the other hand, which reﬂects the\
    \ reliability and robustness of such a technology.\nThe rest of this section discusses\
    \ the proposed architecture from functions and speci-\nﬁcations in ﬁve layers,\
    \ namely, sensor nodes layer, wireless server gateway, drone-LoRa\nlayer, cloud\
    \ layer, and end-user layer.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n8 of 26\nSustainability\

    \ and validated in a farmhouse\nthat covered a large set of different agricultural\
    \ activities using ﬂying IoT. The low-cost\nproposal platform was considered for\
    \ comprehensive monitoring of environmental pa-\nrameters using both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors. Field experiments were carried out\nfrom March 2020 to\
    \ March 2021 at Medenine, Tunisia; some background information about\nthis region,\
    \ such as geographic location, soil property, and climate can be referred to the\n\
    map of world climates.\nThe proposed system can be explained in ﬁve steps, as\
    \ Figure 9 shows. S-THB-M008\nrefers to temperature/humidity sensor, S-RGB-M002\
    \ refers to rain gauge sensor, S-LIB-\nM003 refers to solar radiation sensor,\
    \ and S-SMC-M005 refers to soil moisture smart sensor.\nFirst, both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors collected relevant data from the farm every 1 h.\nSecond,\
    \ these data were stored temporarily on an embedded Secure Digital (SD) card in\n\
    the wireless server gateway. Third, the drone ﬂew and collected data from various\
    \ wireless\nserver gateways located in the farm every 12 h. Fourth, the drone\
    \ sent the data to the cloud.\nFifth, automated and human-made sets of actions\
    \ could be taken to apply smart actions\nfor precision agriculture, which, in\
    \ turn, dramatically boost crop productivity, and help\nin saving natural resources.\
    \ These actions could be obtained from the cloud into the user\ninterface smart\
    \ device. However, a decision support system could be introduced in a future\n\
    study to link the farm’s smart devices together to achieve an autonomous system.\n\

    \ its relevant sensor in a period from March 2020 to March 2021 in Medenine, \n\
    Tunisia. Experimental results indicate that the average radiation floats between\
    \ 400 and \n1000 W/mଶ; in winter readings display around 400  W/mଶ, while autumn\
    \ readings show \naround 600–800  W/mଶ, and summer readings show around 1000 W/mଶ.\
    \ Therefore, smart \nactions can be considered based on solar radiation data such\
    \ as the following: \n• \nProviding valuable data on solar light intensity and\
    \ duration since plants do not ab-\nsorb all sunlight, due to reflection, possible\
    \ damage leaves, and respiration require-\nments of photosynthesis; \n• \nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from the high light \n\
    intensity in open fields during summer; \n• \nAdjust irrigation using automated\
    \ dripping and sprinkling based on the solar radia-\ntion measurements since the\
    \ temperature is usually linked to the actual amount of \nsunshine; \n• \nUsing\
    \ solar panels for powering the weather station leads to energy efficiency; \n\
    • \nFarmers are advised to seed (e.g., wheat seeded) early spring since seeding\
    \ earlier \ncan provide crops a yield advantage; \n• \nPlantings and quarterly\
    \ grains that are suggested for the Medenine area in case of \nmiddle-range of\
    \ solar radiation conditions are beans, pineapple, lettuce, and raspber-\nries.\
    \ \nTo sum up, the more we understand the relationships between the monitored\
    \ crops \ntheir surrounding climate, the better we can plan and design stronger\
    \ cropping practices. \nThe proposed design in this paper emphasizes automated\
    \ and real-time monitoring of the \nenvironmental parameters and making wise decisions\
    \ and actions, either automated or \nhuman-made sets of actions, which, in turn,\
    \ lead to vegetative growth, root growth, water \nuptake, saved resources, and\
    \ flowering. Moreover, these sets of actions would support \nsmart decisions for\
    \ precision agriculture during four seasons and hence increase crop \nproductivity.\

    \ station and the drone at the cloud layer. Experimental predic-\ntions of the\
    \ considered Hata propagation model show that the range of PL floats between \n\
    −97 dB to −127.5 dB. Additionally, PL has a positive correlation with distance,\
    \ which rep-\nresents the drone altitude. Noticeably, the shadowing effect and\
    \ reflection of signals from \ninterfering obstacles were low, due to line-of-sight\
    \ connectivity between the ground sta-\ntion and the drone. As RSS is linked to\
    \ PL, results show RSS varying between −40 dBm to \n−70 dBm, which has again a\
    \ positive correlation with distance (drone altitude). Unsurpris-\ningly, increasing\
    \ transmission power would enhance RSS, since RSS depends on transmit-\nter power,\
    \ antenna gains, and environmental factors. Having the results of the propaga-\n\
    tion model including PL and RSS is useful in monitoring system performance, network\
    \ \nplanning, and coverage to achieve perfect reception. In our scenario, this\
    \ means commu-\nnication between drone and ground station as well as wireless\
    \ server gateway showing a \nhigh level of reception with the smallest attenuated\
    \ signal, besides achieving stronger \nwireless connectivity. This also helps\

    \ farming involves the integration of advanced technologies into existing farm-\n\
    ing practices to increase production efﬁciency and quality of agricultural products.\
    \ The\nevolution of IoT and UAVs has enabled the vision of sustainable smart farming,\
    \ where\nthese smart technologies have proven to increase the quality of crop\
    \ yield and reduce the\nenvironmental footprint from the agricultural sector.\
    \ This paper shows a low-cost platform\nfor comprehensive environmental parameter\
    \ monitoring using ﬂying IoT. The proposal is\nbased on experimental work to fulﬁll\
    \ the requirements of automated and real-time monitor-\ning of the environmental\
    \ parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These\nIoT sensors devices\
    \ on a farm collect vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent\nto ground\
    \ gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data are collected and transmitted\n\
    by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This platform is\
    \ deployed\nand tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the\
    \ period of March 2020\nto March 2021, covering open-ﬁeld and greenhouse cultivation.\
    \ This low-cost platform\ncan help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to\
    \ predict environmental conditions\ndata over the geographically large farm ﬁeld,\
    \ which leads to enhancement of crop produc-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n\

    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    Abstract: Future buildings will offer new convenience, comfort, and efficiency
    possibilities to their residents. Changes will occur to the way people live as
    technology involves people''s lives and information processing is fully integrated
    into their daily living activities and objects. The future expectation of smart
    buildings includes making the residents'' experience as easy and comfortable as
    possible. The massive streaming data generated and captured by smart building
    appliances and devices contain valuable information that needs to be mined to
    facilitate timely actions and better decision making. Machine learning and big
    data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role to enable the delivery of
    such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area of smart building with
    a special focus on the role of techniques from machine learning and big data analytics.
    This survey also reviews the current trends and challenges faced in the development
    of smart building services. The major machine learning tasks that are relevant
    to smart buildings include: data collection and acquisition, data pre-processing,
    and dimensionality reduction. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 7) Page(s):

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is believed to have a significant potential
    use in tackling climate change. This paper explores the connections between AI
    and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation
    efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications
    of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational
    and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the
    various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions,
    and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles
    are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues
    and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted
    the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%).
    In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning
    the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford
    policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that,
    provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to
    global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated
    with a changing climate. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    Artificial intelligenceDigital technologiesClimate change adaptation 1. Introduction:
    using artificial intelligence in climate change research The notion of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) indicates the abilities of machines to "learn from experience,
    adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks" (Duan et al., 2019, p. 63)
    to "interpret external data correctly, to learn from such data, and to use those
    learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation" (Kaplan
    and Haenlein, 2019, p. 17). Recent developments in AI have triggered significant
    breakthroughs and consequences across all aspects of human life. At the same time,
    the value of AI is estimated to reach up to $16 trillion by 2030 (Walsh et al.,
    2020). Even though an overarching definition for AI remains an elusive task, it
    is commonly accepted that such disruptive technological advancements open up new
    possibilities in the automation of repetitive and, usually, time-consuming tasks,
    offer new opportunities for pattern recognition in large amounts of unstructured
    data and integrate the self-learning of novel algorithms (Bhatia, 2017; Ghallab
    et al., 2016). Representing a new era in the knowledge society, AI brings new
    opportunities to interpret external datasets, imitating human cognitive functions
    and addressing complexities linked to human thought or feelings (Kaplan and Haenlein,
    2019; Russell and Norvig, 2016; Martınez-Miranda and Aldea, 2005). AI has penetrated
    most aspects of our life and its massive power, coupled with big data, is evolving
    geometrically. AI is bound to alter production processes across all business sectors
    and foster advanced, innovative and long-term solutions to pressing sustainability
    challenges. Under the scope of sustainability-orientated research AI is employed
    through supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning models, pertaining
    to algorithms that predict, identify and/or inherent patterns from labeled, unlabelled
    or semi-labeled input data, respectively (Nishant et al., 2020; García et al.,
    2019). Generalised linear models, decision trees, cognitive computing, support
    vector machines, Bayesian and artificial neural networks are some AI models gaining
    traction in the past few years (Shrestha and Mahmood, 2019; Şerban and Lytras,
    2020). Natural computing is a subfield aimed at algorithm optimisation utilising
    biophysical material as computational media and simulating environmental phenomena
    in computers (Brabazon et al., 2015). Expert systems are also emerging themes
    linked with AI''s capacity to solve complex problems of the natural world, such
    as climate change impact assessments, and aid decision-making by relying on specific
    knowledge and inference derived from databases and inference engines (Leo Kumar,
    2019; Nishant et al., 2020). Walsh et al. (2020) pinpoint key attributes describing
    the interactions between the global climate system and human psychology. Such
    attributes refer to our inability to comprehend the impacts of climate change
    due to their extreme scale and duration, our (mere) reliance on predictive models
    that encapsulate risks and uncertainty, the remoteness of climate change impacts
    in terms of space as well as time, and the inherent common-pool resource constraints
    of anthropogenic GHG emissions that hamper collective mitigation actions. These
    properties explain why climate change affects livelihoods and incurs multidimensional
    impacts, spanning from rising temperatures and increased frequency of extreme
    weather events to the aggravation of socioeconomic inequalities and human diseases.
    In this context, the computational architecture and power that AI encapsulates
    are particularly fitting in grappling with such pressing climate change threats,
    a domain of global environmental changes described by massive data availability,
    processing and forecasting challenges (Stein, 2020). Multi-sensor-driven AI tools
    and blockchain platforms can optimise circular economy loops (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis,
    2018; Kouhizadeh et al., 2019; Adebiyi-Abiola et al., 2019; Wang and Qu, 2019),
    giving room to sustainability transitions that reduce the carbon footprint and
    uncontrolled disposal of solid waste (Sankaran, 2019) as well as our dependence
    on primary (non-renewable) resources. Likewise, neural or sensor networks, machine
    learning, and cognitive computing can bring profound energy management and optimisation
    capabilities and smart urban planning and design (Şerban and Lytras, 2020). Utilising
    such AI advances can yield unprecedented advantages in analysing interconnected,
    large-scale databases to minimise the carbon intensity of systems, model possible
    climate change impacts and maximise resource efficiency through smart grids and
    connected smart appliances. Neural networks and smart algorithms, in particular,
    can also contribute to developing joint actions aimed at preserving the ecosystem''s
    health and biological diversity, combat desertification, soil degradation and
    marine pollution (e.g. Keramitsoglou et al., 2006; Mohamadi et al., 2016; Kwok,
    2019; Nunes et al., 2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020). It is well-established in the
    literature that emphasising carbon neutrality in electricity production and distribution,
    transportation, agriculture, as well as construction and buildings can have tremendous
    benefits in climate change mitigation and, in this respect, AI can be a critical
    agent of change (e.g. see Stein, 2020). AI applications may also upscale climate
    engagement of the public and stimulate collective action by predicting or visualising
    climate change risks and aid decision-support efforts by monitoring extreme weather
    disasters (remotely and) in real-time (Alemany et al., 2019; Huntingford et al.,
    2019; Walsh et al., 2020). For example, AIDR (Artificial Intelligence for Digital
    Response) assists relief organizations by analysing big data, that is, tweets,
    to detect the location and impacts of floods (Imran et al., 2014). There are other
    AI models that can immensely help disaster relief by mapping floods, locating
    refugee camps using satellite data (Logar et al., 2020) and determining the populations
    requiring the most help (Omdena and WFP, 2020). Indeed, AI advancements in climate
    big data processing allow for the identification of much more comprehensive future
    climate change scenarios and intelligent early warning systems. Projects like
    EnviroAtlas offer actionable insights into climate change implications on societies,
    ecosystems and healthcare (Manogaran and Lopez, 2018). For instance, ambient intelligence
    using sensor networks provides real-time climate data (Dingli et al., 2012; Ribeiro
    and José, 2013) and brings new opportunities in monitoring climate change impacts
    and disease forecasting and surveillance (Booth, 2018; Waits et al., 2018; Manogaran
    and Lopez, 2018). AI is also useful for assessing impacts of climate change on
    agriculture. Crane-Droesch, A. (2018) has developed a machine learning based model
    that can predict corn production under different climate change scenarios. Jakariya
    et al. (2020) has developed a mobile application using machine learning methods
    that can assess vulnerability of farmers in coastal Bangladesh based on an individual''s
    responses to a questionnaire. Nevertheless, AI applications aiming to endorse
    environmental sustainability are challenged by the rebound effects of high energy-intensive
    structures, undermining efforts to achieve carbon-neutrality and avoiding overexploitation
    of primary resources. For example, server operating systems that execute essential
    AI computational tasks (or store big data) entail considerable energy for cooling
    and unhindered operation. At the same time, their production, service and final
    disposal require vast amounts of non-renewable materials (such as lithium, nickel
    or cobalt) and efficient e-waste management, respectively (Kaplan and Haenlein,
    2020). By performing a comprehensive review of the available literature, Nishant
    et al. (2020) also point out as significant challenges posed by AI-based applications
    the overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, undesirable human
    responses to AI interventions, the underlying cybersecurity risks and possible
    adverse impacts of AI applications as well as a lack of holistic metrics for AI
    performance measurement. Moreover, before launching AI deployments, it is crucial
    to increase the awareness of risks associated with likely failures of AI systems
    in a society progressively more dependent on this technology (Vinuesa et al.,
    2020). Related challenges in climate big data in the global earth observation
    system are outlined in Faghmous and Kumar (2014), Lee and Kang (2015) and Nativi
    et al. (2015). Crucially, underlying gaps in ethical, transparency, equality and
    safety standards stemming from such challenges call for regulatory insights and
    appropriate legislation frameworks to address counterproductive outcomes from
    AI penetration patterns (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020; Petit,
    2018). Overall, digital technologies (DTs) are transforming societies and accelerating
    achievements faster than any previous innovation over last two decades (United
    Nations, 2020). Digitalization and digital economies additionally trigged by the
    COVID-19 pandemic (MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, 2021) significantly
    contribute to climate actions (Balogun et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Dwivedi
    et al., 2022). DT itself can potentially directly reduce global emissions up to
    15% by 2030 and additional 35% by impacting on transformation of systems as well
    as business and consumers decisions (Falk et al., 2020). Given the above and taking
    into account that AI research and development can be a significant game-changer
    towards advanced, innovative and long-term solutions to pressing climate change
    threats, this study aims to review AI applications for climate change adaptation.
    We used a systematic review of the literature on these subjects based on an online
    survey to achieve this. The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes
    the relation between AI and Climate Change Adaptation. Further, Section 3 presents
    the methods used, namely an expert-driven systematic literature review complemented
    by a global online survey. Section 4 discusses the main results. Section 5, the
    conclusions section, summarises implications of the paper and outlines future
    prospects. The paper ends with two Appendixes. Appendix 1 (Systematic Literature
    Review with a data matrix which summarises examples of the articles used and their
    references) and Appendix 2 which includes the survey instrument deployed in the
    study. 2. Artificial intelligence and climate change adaptation AI and its subset
    of machine learning have drawn significant attention in recent years. The influence
    of such technology on human life has increased due to the improved connectivity,
    data storage and processor speed. AI is frequently used in many sectors such as
    health and transport (Huntingford et al., 2019); renewable energies (He et al.,
    2021); education (Shaikh et al., 2021); construction industry (Abioye et al.,
    2021); ocean dynamics (Zhao et al., 2021); environmental quality control (Liu
    et al., 2021a); biodiversity (Li, 2020); agriculture (Liu et al., 2021b). Yet,
    for climate change adaptation, AI is used in the cities and mobility sustainability
    (Balogun et al., 2020); housing cooling system (Ahmed et al., 2021); water sustainability
    (Doorn, 2021); energy sustainability (Ahmad et al., 2021). Although AI and machine
    learning are helpful in climate change adaptation, their combined use was previously
    neglected due to the lack of power and computer capacities, which is particularly
    important as climate change is a data-intensive issue with various subsets. However,
    recent advancements enable scientists to incorporate AI into climate change adaptation
    (Huntingford et al., 2019). AI may be used in multiple ways to increase adaptation
    to climate change, to the same extent that climate-smart technologies do (Tran
    et al., 2020). Firstly, systems may be designed to monitor meteorological measurements
    using high resolution and spatial data. Secondly, machine learning can be used
    to draw links between location, time, and changes of the meteorological measurements.
    After that, interpreted data can be fed into artificial intelligence systems that
    provide automated warnings to people about erratic weather patterns and extreme
    weather events caused by climate change (Huntingford et al., 2019). Scientists
    are now able to combine machine learning with climate models. Machine learning
    is valuable, as it helps to solve previous problems by offering accurate results
    that are less expensive than older models. Previous models faced difficulties
    dealing with large amounts of data. However, machine learning can efficiently
    process data faster, which is beneficial in predicting extreme weather events,
    and models are now being redesigned or modified to include machine learning (Rolnick
    et al., 2019). Climate change has a significant societal impact that translates
    to ecological and socioeconomic issues in a given country. Machine learning has
    uses in alerting citizens by identifying and prioritising areas of high risk.
    Besides, it may provide annotation by using raw data and promoting exchange, making
    it easier for data to be shared, allowing people to develop adaptation methods
    by deciding on the highest risks and using shared information to generate solutions
    (Rolnick et al., 2019). With regards to ecology, AI is used to monitor live ecosystems
    and track biodiversity. By tracking species and their numbers, conservationists
    can decide areas of high priority and low priority. Furthermore, machine learning
    is used in the form of image-based sensors to monitor biodiversity. These are
    automatically triggered by movement, and cameras capture pictures that can be
    used to classify species (Rolnick et al., 2019). AI has great potential in the
    energy industry. The reduction of fossil fuels used requires that the energy crisis
    be addressed, which, in turn, will reduce the climate change impacts and make
    adaptation easier (Walsh et al., 2020). A key example is Google using machine
    learning to increase wind generation efficiency and predict power output, increasing
    the value of their wind energy by a 20% factor (Elkin and Witherspoon, 2019).
    Promotion of alternative energy sources aids in lowering carbon emissions. In
    similar ways, AI and machine learning can be used to regulate building energy
    and thus can be applied to the construction of intelligent cities (Rolnick et
    al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2020) 3. Methods This paper seeks to identify the nexus
    between AI and climate change adaptation in a sample of countries known to be
    investing resources on AI for various climate change adaptation purposes primarily
    based on a systematic literature search that was implemented, adapting the model
    used by Leal Filho et al. (2019). The following data collection and analysis steps
    were conducted sequentially: Identify data sources; select pieces of pertinent
    literature; perform critical evaluation of studies; distil synthesis of acquired
    prior studies and document essential findings. This systematic method facilitates
    the aggregation of a significant volume of information in the search, thereby
    offering detailed and reliable information for diverse stakeholders in the AI-climate
    change adaptation domain. Care was taken to select reliable sources for the research
    data since top quality resources are essential requirements for a good literature
    search (Balogun et al., 2020). Literature searches were based on some of the most
    reputable online databases of scientific research data, including Web of Science,
    Scopus, and Google Scholar. We also consulted reports from specialised organisations
    (e.g. research centres and societies, UN bodies, and the OECD). In addition, the
    scope of literature sources was extended to include search engines (e.g., Google)
    to ensure that relevant publications which are not included in scientific databases
    were not omitted. The parameters analysed in such literature include (i) Theme/Category,
    (ii) AI Application, (iii) Implications, (iv) Region. Some of the syntaxes used
    include: ⁎ Global/Earth ⁎ Disaster Response ⁎ Water-related issues ⁎ Agriculture
    ⁎ Water-related management issues ⁎ Agricultural, Land or Tree ⁎ Energy ⁎ Wildfire
    ⁎ Specific AI Techniques Further, to complement the above mentioned systematic
    literature review, a global online survey based on a questionnaire was administered,
    with a focus on DTs and AI for climate change adaptation. The structured questionnaire
    survey was made available to respondents for approximately two weeks in February
    2021 through the online Google forms platform tool. The survey design was deployed
    with a view to catering for a ''rapid turnaround in data collection'' (Creswell
    and Creswell 2018, p. 149). It was supplemented by a critical expert literature
    analysis (Machi and McEvoy 2016), which provided a robust foundation for the execution
    of this research. Overall, the survey instrument comprised sixteen closed-ended
    questions, of which three questions offered scope for a brief qualitative analysis.
    The survey questions were designed to probe aspects of research relevance at the
    intersection of AI and climate change management. The questions were organised
    into the categories of ''general questions'' (e.g. What is your climate change
    research orientated towards?) and ''technical questions'' (e.g. In which areas
    do you see a promising use of DTs and AI in climate change context?). The data
    collection instrument was developed through an iterative process that solicited
    input and feedback from a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate
    change researchers. Following the instrument''s conceptual development, the data
    collection instrument was pre-tested, which led to minor adjustments, but overall
    confirmed its adequacy (Bryman 2016, pp. 260–261). The purposive sampling ensured
    that the survey instrument was appropriate for the envisaged target group, which
    comprised academics working in disciplines related to climate change, including
    mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, a snowball sampling was used to leverage
    the research networks of the authors and ''capitalise on the connectedness of
    individuals in research networks'' (Bryman 2016, p. 415). The participation in
    the survey was solicited by email during the above stated data collection time
    frame. The subsequent descriptive statistical analysis allowed the researchers
    to characterise the prominent trends (Punch 2014; Creswell 2013, 2014). Selected
    respondent comments, to which our analysis refers in some places of this paper,
    resulted from those three questions which allowed respondents to provide qualitative
    answers. The qualitative responses were analysed through a content analysis using
    coding and categorisation (Creswell and Creswell, 2018). The inferential analysis
    of the data was performed using the statistical software SPSS. 4. Results and
    discussion 4.1. Systematic literature review The systematic literature review
    has assessed the current research areas in applying AI and climate change. Appendix
    1 provides a summary of the identified research publications, which are categorised
    under the Adaptation or Mitigation category. Each article is further classified
    under the following main areas: 1 = Global or Earth Related; 2 = City or Urban
    Related; 3 = Disaster Response; 4 = Water-related Issues; 5 = Agricultural, Land
    or Tree; 6 = Energy; 7 = Wildfire; 8 = Specific AI Technique (s). Around 95% of
    these studies are related to climate change adaptation, whereas 5% of them refer
    to mitigation. In particular, the use of AI for adaptation is frequently performed
    for monitoring climate dynamics, and in predicting the adverse impacts of climate
    change in cities and the urban environment. Making other areas, AI is deployed
    to develop sophisticated modelling and forecasting for evaluating vulnerabilities
    of different regions of the world. This approach is considered relevant to policy
    and decision-makers in environment planning and action plan formulation, in light
    of potential disasters and adversities to human health. From a risk management
    perspective, the use of AI in this context is useful in anticipating scenarios
    that could be dealt with, by formulating measures to reduce possible climate change
    impacts, and even avoid potential losses due to climate-associated problems where
    conceivable. The assessed studies were either reviews (4), case studies (17),
    or experimental studies (35). The case studies involved Asia (8), Europe (6),
    Australia (2), and North America (1), respectively. Nearly half of the literature
    assessed (27 out 56) focused heavily on the significant role of AI in understanding
    future outlooks, where issues related to forecasting, projection, and modelling
    of extreme weather events, resource use, and the even impact of conservation and
    adaptation efforts were predominant. In terms of humanitarian responses in the
    wake of extreme weather events, fewer than ten studies addressed the application
    of AI in disaster risk reduction and response. Similarly, little attention was
    given to AI''s role in unlocking the blue economy''s potential, as only six studies
    underscored its application in inland and natural coastal capitals. amongst the
    literature assessed, AI was noted to have gained traction in terms of its application
    in biotechnology, agronomy, and plant science, particularly at a time when drought
    and pest-resistant crop varieties are most sought in many places around the world.
    The place of AI in the clinical characterisation of mental health cases emerged
    only once where virtual reality (VR) is relevant in assessing, treating, and managing
    posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These findings echo the broad application
    areas previously studied, but extend previous studies by representing the spread
    and reach of AI application in climate change adaptation (Walsh et al., 2020)
    Fig. 1 reveals that 38% of studies pertinent to water-related issues under climate
    change, including flood prediction and irrigation management, have attracted the
    most research attention on examining the application of AI for adaptation. Download

    Distribution of main research areas on AI application by the identified research
    publications. These studies have examined the vulnerability of various regions
    to potential floods linked to climate change, and evaluated measures to adapt
    based on AI applications. The combined categories of agriculture, land and wildfire
    represent 31% of the sampled literature. These studies broadly reveal how AI is
    deployed to predict pertinent events that create challenges and risks to the inhabitants;
    possible solutions are derived. About 27% of the articles provide some reviews
    and assessments on the use of AI technologies to support climate change adaptation
    in disaster management, regional and global deployment potentials in general.
    The remaining 5% suggest the possible innovative deployment of AI for energy management,
    particularly to enhance renewable energy that mitigates greenhouse gas emissions
    and climate change. Contrary to previous studies, this highlights the relative
    concentrated application of AI in relation to disaster management (Stein, 2020).
    4.2. Survey The systematic literature review was complemented by a survey of 104
    respondents from 51 countries. The respondents came from all continents (Fig.
    2), with a majority coming from Africa at 32%, followed by Europe (31%). The lowest
    percentage contribution came from the Oceanic-Australia block, which contributed
    3%. Furthermore, the respondents varied among countries and the rate was 68% male
    and 30% female, whereas about 2% did not state their gender. Download : Download

    of respondents. It was positive that Africa had the most survey participants.
    It is one of the continents is disproportionately affected by climate change;
    therefore, as part of building the adaptation capacity on the continent, participation
    in such studies is vital. Moreover, results from the systematic review indicated
    that comparatively few case studies from the continent are document. Thus, number
    of African respondents to the survey can offer valuable insights to make up for
    the absence of case studies from the region. Even though South America, Australia
    and Oceania did not have a high number of participants, these continents are also
    expected to suffer several adverse climate change effects; hence adaptation capacity
    may be increased by integrating AI and other related DTs. Respondents provided
    various types of replies to the questions posed (Table 1). The most robust agreements
    were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to ''strengthen governance
    practices and policy coherence in climate change'' (90%), to ''strengthen environmental
    sustainability and reduce climate vulnerability'' (89%), and to ''deliver economic
    and environmental benefits in climate change management'' (88%). These reflect
    the positive intentions of AI reported in the literature (Stein, 2020). Table

    4.11 1.09 However, there was also a recognition of the ''need to keep the public
    well informed, with full transparency and accountability'' (90% of respondents
    agreed or strongly agreed), ''the use of digitalisation and AI needs to be paralleled
    by privacy and data protection procedures'' (89%), and that the ''limitations
    in digital connectivity disproportionately affect developing countries'' (85%),
    which demonstrates a balanced view of both the benefits and implications of digitisation
    and AI in climate change research and practice. Whereas the former of these reflect
    the extant literature, the latter points to broader awareness of the inequalities
    that has hitherto not been so explicit (Walsh et al., 2020). Responses on the
    relevance of DTs and AI to climate change action were mixed across the continents
    (Fig. 3a). Respondents from Australia demonstrated the most affirmative responses
    (where 100% of respondents replied ''very important and frequently used'' or ''important
    and sometimes used''). North America and South America offered the subsequent
    highest affirmative responses (80% and 75%, respectively). Download : Download

    digital tools and AI to (a) climate action (b) project cooperation (c) climate
    change management in the next ten years (d) organisational expenditure on digitalisation
    for climate change. The only continent with respondents reporting ‘no meaning
    to my work and uses at all’ was Africa (5%). These findings might reflect limited
    national resources and the stage of technology diffusion in climate change action
    across the continents. For instance, many farmers in Africa still rely on rainfed
    agriculture, increasing vulnerability to impacts of climate change (Serdeczny
    et al., 2017). Moreover, digital data on local climate projections and weather
    forecasts to support optimal farming practices in the region is scarce (Balogun
    et al., 2020), aligning with the findings of this study. However, such findings
    are consistent with the aforementioned finding related to the unequal access to
    resources such as AI and DTs which is hitherto largely absent in the extant literature
    (Walsh et al., 2020). Similarly, the adoption of DT for climate change adaptation
    in North America has been documented in earlier studies. An example is the United
    States'' Southeast Climate Consortium''s (SECC) agrometeorological program aiding
    the management of climate risks in the past decade. With this initiative, digital
    tools are used to simplify and communicate complex climatic concepts to enhance
    farmers'' understanding and awareness of climate impacts on agriculture (AgroClimate,
    2015). In contrast to previous studies, this finding highlights the differential
    application of AI and DTs across countries in relation to climate change adaptation
    (Alemany et al., 2019). The relevance of DTs and AI to project cooperation was
    affirmative across all continents (Fig. 3b). As noted, the most affirmative responses
    were in Oceania and Australia, with 100% of respondents reporting ''very important
    and frequently used''. The answer ''has some importance and occasionally used''
    was most commonly reported in North America (13%), Europe (12%), and Asia (10%).
    These findings reflect the widespread use of communications technologies in project
    activity across all continents, and is an aspect not typically reported in previous
    studies about the use of AIs and DTs in climate change adaptation (e.g. Stein,
    2020). In its study of the application of digitalisation for sustainable development
    in the global north and south, Balogun et al. (2020) reported the prevalence of
    DTs (e.g., big data analytics) in all continents to enhance urban resilience.
    Also, Mckinley et al. (2021) highlighted the emergence of innovative digital tools,
    methods, and approaches to support a wide range of project cooperation, including
    aspects of climate change action. The extended employment of DTs is evident during
    the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate stakeholder engagement, project cooperation,
    communication, research and teaching (Leal Filho et al., 2021a). Notably, the
    relevance of DTs and AI for future climate change management (Fig. 3c) is overwhelmingly
    expected to ‘increase’ or ‘greatly increase’ by respondents in all regions. In
    terms of predicted future institutional investments in digitisation (Fig. 3d),
    findings indicated affirmative results from Oceania (100%), North America (85%),
    Africa (64%), and Europe (63%). In contrast, respondents from the following indicated
    no further investments: Australia (100%), South America (58%) and Asia (57%).
    These results might reflect current commitments to maintain technological advancements
    in ongoing climate change activity (e.g. in Oceania) or potential maintenance
    and utilisation of previous institutional investments in technology (e.g. as demonstrated
    in China and other parts of Asia in recent years). These findings add new insight
    into the perception of ongoing investment in AI, an area currently unexplored
    in the literature (Walsh et al., 2020), but indicative of future intent and activity.
    The survey indicated that 54% of respondents disagreed that DTs will strengthen
    the governance practice and policy coherence in climate change (Fig. 4a). In comparison,
    36% agreed that DTs could be of assistance in the development of climate change
    governance policies, which can be linked to the detachments that often exist between
    policymakers and advancements in scientific fields. Furthermore, the governance
    sphere is a complicated field that is often a contested terrain among policymakers
    and politicians alike. Therefore, it is imperative that even though DTs can be
    proven tools in improving governance, vested interest also needs to be taken into
    account during policy formulation. From a continental angle, respondents from
    Oceania and Australia totally agreed with the view; however, this analysis needs
    to be treated with caution due to the small size of the sample from the two continents.
    These findings sit in contrast to previous findings as they provide a more sceptical
    picture of how AI can be applied in policy and governance fields (Rolnick et al.,
    2019). Download : Download high-res image (639KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. The capacity of DTs and AI to (a) strengthen governance and policy
    coherence, (b) deliver economic and environmental benefits, (c) strengthen environmental
    sustainability and reduce climate vulnerability, and (d) mitigate the inequalities
    from climate change. Concerning that the timely implementation of DTs and AI deliver
    economic and environmental benefits in climate change management (Fig. 4b), most
    respondents agree (particularly from South America and Europe) or strongly agree
    (particularly from Oceania and Europe). Only the responses from Australia are
    neutral. Regarding the capacity of DTs to reduce climate change vulnerability,
    40% and 45% of respondents strongly agreed and agreed, respectively, that DTs
    might reduce climate change vulnerability, with the highest percentage coming
    from North America, besides the 100% from Australia and Oceania (Fig. 4c). This
    aligns with the outcome of the literature review and confirms opportunities to
    use AI and digital tools to find practical adaptive approaches to climate change.
    Such tools include machine learning applications in climate change. This position
    was established by O''Gorman and Dweyer (2018). They asserted that machine learning
    helps reduce uncertainties associated with climate models, thus further affirming
    that AI can be a valuable tool in climate change. The exact position is also articulated
    and highlighted by Vinuesa et al. (2020), who assert that AI can be integrated
    with improving renewable energy capabilities and energy efficiency, thus reducing
    the total greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint. Finally, concerning DTs
    being a tool to reduce inequalities (Fig. 4d), 38% of respondents agreed that
    digital tools could reduce inequalities due to climate change. Thus, most respondents
    in all regions (except Australia) expect DT and AI to strengthen governance practices
    and policy coherence in climate change. The survey respondents still hold considerable
    fear regarding the threat posed by DTs and AI to humankind, as confirmed by 30%
    of respondents indicating that AI and related technologies pose some danger (Fig.
    5a). The highest percentage of concern came from Australia (100%), Oceania (50%),
    and South America (38%). In comparison, respondents'' in Africa only reflected
    a minor level of anxiety at 22%. Fears related to impacts on employment (Fig.
    5b) are nuanced and noticeable across all continents, although at close to 60%
    Europeans are more cautious than North Americans. Generally, apprehension stems
    from the belief that AI may create a superhuman with capabilities beyond human
    beings (Yu et al., 2018), eventually overtaking human beings and lacking consciousness
    (Dehaene et al., 2017). Respondents also strongly felt that connectivity and infrastructure
    issues could negatively affect the capacity of developing countries to take full
    advantage of advancements in AI and other digital tools (Fig. 5c). Download :

    response on risks posed by AI on (a) mankind (b) employment (c) limitations of
    developing countries (d) personal privacy. The fear of AI is further confirmed
    by respondents agreeing across all continents that there is a need for privacy
    and data protection procedures when applying AI (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5d shows agreement
    and convergence regarding digitalisation, and AI needs to be paralleled by privacy
    and data protection procedures for all regions. The Australia region, and Oceania,
    both with 100%, are the most positive or affirmative, if compared to the South
    America and European region, with more than 80% and 60%, respectively. Although
    Asia and North America are both positive, they had relatively lower values (both
    over 35%) than Australia and Oceania. Although Africa is considered a relatively
    backward region in the use and exploitation of advanced technologies, especially
    digitisation and AI, it presented a relatively higher value (more than 50%) when
    compared to North America and the Asian region. Whilst some of these fears have
    been previously reported, the extent and reach of these fears has not previously
    been reported on a global level (Stein, 2020). This is an important dimension
    to consider in further implementation and exploitation of AI for climate change
    adaptation. From the survey, 40% and 44% of respondents from across all the continents
    agreed that leveraging DTs and AI can be valuable tools in increasing research
    in climate change-related issues and the implementation of SDG13 (Fig. 6a and
    b). On a continental level, 68% of respondents from South America felt that AI
    and related digital tools could assist as tools of research and assist in the
    implementation of SDG13. This view is supported by Belayneh et al. (2016), who
    assert that AI can easily be leveraged in drought forecasting, which can subsequently
    reduce the cost of food insecurity interventions as well as assist in saving lives.
    The use of AI in climate research and action is further advocated in Huntingford
    et al. (2019), who encouraged the use of models and data-driven machine learning
    to provide warnings and decision-making support, notably drought predictions.
    Similar opportunities for AI about disaster management and mitigation are noted
    by Sun et al. (2020) and Sayad et al. (2019), respectively. Our study findings
    are similar to Vinuesa et al. (2020), which established that AI could act as an
    enabler in achieving environmental-related outcomes, including SDG13. Download

    Leveraging digital tools and AI can assist in (a) teaching, and research (b) accelerating
    progress towards implementation of SDG13, (c) faster and broader scale deployment
    (d) enhancing climate resilience and post COVID-19 recovery. On the other hand,
    40% and 41% of respondents respectively, believed that AI and DTs would not be
    good tools to aid research in climate change and the implementation of SDG13 as
    some of the AI techniques are high energy demanders, and particularly where non-carbon
    neutral energy sources are used (Vinuesa et al., 2020). The research results allow
    the authors to highlight the existence of imbalances on the understanding of technological
    advances, or whether digitalisation and AI will be deployed much faster and on
    a broader scale than in the past (Fig. 6c). These disagreements, mainly in Africa,
    maybe associated in part due to limited use of technologies and digitisation in
    various productive sectors, limited information on the current dynamics of technologies
    and AI, and reduced opportunities for technological production and transformation
    (Van Rensburg et al., 2019; Cariolle, 2020). Furthermore, another set of risks
    can be classified as cyber physical and structural imbalances (Jelinek et al.,
    2021) thus limiting equitable AI adoption by all countries. However, the significant
    climate sensitivity, exposure, and reduced adaptive capacities in Africa consequently
    translate into major vulnerability (Ahmadalipour et al., 2019; Leal Filho et al.,
    2021b). This may require advanced technological options such as AI to detect,
    predict, record, and report extreme weather events, sudden events, predictability
    of impacts, and mitigation and adaptation options. Nevertheless, North and South
    America, with more than 80% and 75%, respectively, were more optimistic about
    the rapid advances in digitisation and accelerated implementation of AI. Such
    optimism could mean acquiring most of the knowledge, production capacity, technological
    transformation, and digitisation of these regions. Consistent with responses to
    other questions, answers are skewed in favour of the expectation that the use
    of DTs and AI will be critical for a climate-resilient and sustainable COVID-19
    pandemic recovery, with a clear majority of respondents in all regions (except
    Australia) expressing this expectation (Fig. 6d). The Australian region, with
    100%, is less favourable compared to all regions. A more positive affirmation
    was verified in the Oceania region, with 100%, and North America, with more than
    65%. With more than 50%, Africa was more favourable than the Asian region (more
    than 40%) and Europe (more than 35%). We understand that the less favourable position
    of the Australian region (100%) can be justified likely due to (1) the existence
    of similar tools that can play and support climate resilience and sustainable
    COVID −19 pandemic recovery, and (2) climate change and COVID-19 pandemic are
    consequences of human behaviour, which can be positively changed, if there is
    a will, decision, commitment, and all this anchored to well-founded and effective
    policies. The practical application of AI can be a valuable tool shown by Buckland
    et al. (2019). They established that ANNs could be applied in future predictions
    of future natural or human-induced disturbances of climatic systems. The practical
    application of AI is also further demonstrated in Mohamadi et al. (2016), where
    a trained AI system can track the desertification of regions. Furthermore, McGovern
    et al. (2017) indicated that AI could assist in improving forecast models as several
    AI techniques can extract information through blending observational data and
    forecast model information; hence quality outcomes can be derived. Furthermore,
    evidence exists that shows that AI will assist in better understanding the climate
    change phenomenon as well as modelling the impacts thereof (Vinuesa et al., 2020);
    however, this will not be possible in situations where DT distribution is already
    uneven between rich and developing countries (WHO, 2019). Duan et al. (2019) advocate
    for governments worldwide to develop relevant policies that will be a reference
    point in the use of AI to avoid unintended negative consequences on society. This
    assertion further highlights the fear which has gripped both the scientific community
    and the general population regarding AI. In this sense, it may be constructive
    to synthesise the prospects involving AI and DTs as a kind of balancing act whereby
    their perceived potential risks are juxtaposed against their current and future
    capacity to mitigate climate-related risks, i.e., through enhanced options for
    climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, preparedness, wildfire prediction
    and prevention (Dehaene et al., 2017; Huntingford et al., 2019; Sayad et al.,
    2019; Sun et al., 2020; Luetz and Rumsey, 2021; Zhao et al., 2020). 5. Conclusions
    This research has tried to analyse the connections between AI and climate change
    adaptation. One of the main findings from the study is that respondents from North
    America and South America are already extensively applying and utilising DTs and
    AI as tools to increase climate change adaptation. This was evidenced by the high
    levels of optimism as indicated by 80% of respondents from North America and 75%
    from South America agreeing that these tools are essential hence being frequently
    used. These positions from the two continents can be attributed to the availability
    of appropriate infrastructure that facilitates the use and deployment of such
    technologies. However, the situation was different for African respondents, where
    some respondents indicated that they seldom use DTs or AI as part of their climate
    adaptation tools box. Thus, the lack of enthusiasm in applying DTs and AI in dealing
    with climate change adaptation in Africa may be a result of the lack of the required
    infrastructure to deploy these technologies. This trend, in turn, offers an opportunity
    for technology developers to provide additional support to African countries,
    so as to bridge the technology gap. The study has also identified the fact that
    there is still considerable fear about the potential risks posed by AI concerning
    humanity, as some respondents felt that AI is an existential threat to humanity.
    Others felt that they fear that robots might take their job. Also, some respondents
    expressed some concerns regarding the potential intrusion on privacy that comes
    from the deployment of AI, mainly if left unregulated and unchecked. Third trend
    shows the need to set up suitable legal-ethical frameworks that may regulate the
    use of AI across different spheres as a whole, and their use in a climate change
    context in particular. Furthermore, besides the fear of AI''s negative consequences
    on humanity, our study established that 44% still believe that AI can be a vital
    tool in teaching and in research, enhancing climate resilience, and supporting
    the post-COVID-19 recovery process. Our study also ascertained that from the respondent''s
    views, DTs were also valuable tools that can be deployed towards supporting research
    on issues related to climate change adaptation and the implementation of SDG13.
    Our study also further established that DTs can also enhance governance and policy
    coherence in climate change response and adaptation. This paper has some limitations.
    The first one is that the literature review contains relatively recent data since
    AI is a topic that has evolved over the past few years. A second limitation is
    the sampling since only 104 people from 51 countries took part in it. A further
    limitation of the paper is that, as  far as the aspects related to the literature
    review are concerned, there is a possibility that not all the papers on the topic
    were considered in the analysis. However, despite the limitations, the study provides
    a welcome addition to the literature. It explores the connections between AI and
    climate change and offers a rough profile of how it is being practised in various
    countries. The implications of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, it sheds some
    light on the extent to which the literature reports on the connections between
    AI and climate change. Secondly, by means of the survey, it describes some pressing
    issues connected with AI, especially its contribution to strengthen governance
    practices and policy coherence in climate change, and the need to keep the public
    well informed, with full transparency and accountability. As breakthroughs continue
    to be made in various fields of AI and DTs, practitioners in climate change can
    take advantage of these developments and deploy AI more systematically, taking
    better advantage of its potential to support increased climate change adaptation.
    Furthermore, in future studies, comprehensive research on the use of AI for mitigating
    climate change can be performed to analyse and predict measures to reduce carbon
    emissions to stabilise the climate. Overall, provided that due care is taken,
    the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand
    and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate. CRediT authorship

    and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate
    global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth
    and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source
    and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting
    of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid
    and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart Agriculture: Testbed General Architecture.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations

    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    \ and machine learning is a hotspot research area in the domain of agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture \nanalytics is a data intensive multidisciplinary problem. Big data\
    \ analytics becomes a key technology to perform analysis \nof voluminous data.\
    \ Irrigation water management is a challenging task for sustainable agriculture.\
    \ It depends on various \nparameters related to climate, soil and weather conditions.\
    \ For accurate estimation of requirement of water for a crop a strong \nmodeling\
    \ is required. This paper aims to review the application of big data based decision\
    \ support system framework for \nsustainable water irrigation management using\
    \ intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments can be \n\
    leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, analytics\
    \ and decision support tools for agriculture \nirrigation water system. Moreover,\
    \ water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using big\
    \ data technolo-\ngies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing\
    \ application based on analytical modeling approach. This \nstudy introduces the\
    \ area of research, including a irrigation water management in smart agriculture,\
    \ the crop water model \nrequirement, and the methods of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ decision support system, and research motivation.\n1 Introduction\nWATER-Every\
    \ drop is precious, save it.  Water is the main \nlimiting factor of agricultural\
    \ development in semi-arid and \narid climates. It is a critical input for enhancing\
    \ agricultural \nproductivity. Arthur Keith said that the advancement of agri-\n\
    culture is the first major step for civilized life [1]. Even after \nsix decades\
    \ of planned development, agriculture has played \nan important role in the Indian\
    \ economy. However, the agri-\nculture sector of India has been transformed via\
    \ the effective \ndeployment of Information and Communication Technolo-\ngies\
    \ (ICTs) in traditional to modern practices which pro-\nvide various services\
    \ (such as- IoT agriculture, smart water \nmanagement, soil management, plant\
    \ diseases, crop manage-\nment, geo-spatial image and livestock monitoring).\n\
    In India, the demand of water for the agriculture and \nindustry sectors is continuously\
    \ increasing to fulfill the \nneeds of 1.366 billion people. Central Indian Punjab\
    \ is well-\nknown for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high \npercentage\
    \ of the land area all over India, and its agricultural \nproduction mainly depends\
    \ on irrigation.\nPunjab has 97.95% highest gross irrigation of the total \ncropped\
    \ area [2]. Recently, the achievement of the Green \nRevolution is endangered\
    \ by a significant decline in water \nresources. As a result, water conservation\
    \ and precision agri-\nculture are becoming vital issues in tropical climate areas.\
    \ \nWheat and Maize are the most commonly cultivated crops \nand have high water\
    \ consumption in Punjab, India. The \nmajor challenge in agriculture sustainability\
    \ and dawdling \nis due to climate change; therefore, every drop of freshwater\
    \ \nneeds to be utilize effectively and efficiently.\nTo overcome these challenges,\
    \ the multivariate, complex, \nand unpredictable agricultural ecosystems must\
    \ be well \nunderstood by continuously analyzing, measuring, and mon-\nitoring\
    \ several physical aspects and phenomena [3]. New \ntechnologies and knowledge\
    \ can help in this complex deci-\nsion-making. The fundamental idea is that the\
    \ DSS should \nserve as a farm management tool, supporting farm managers \nin\
    \ making decisions on irrigation, whether to irrigate and, \nif so, which field\
    \ with how much water. Wani et al. [4] pre-\nsented a thorough investigation to\
    \ evaluate the possibility of \nusing Machine Learning models to identify plant\
    \ diseases.\nIn the early twentieth century, irrigation is the most \ncrucial\
    \ practice no doubt and needs effective utilization. \n * Mandeep Kaur Saggi \n\

    \ \n1 3\nFarmers required to predict the need of water for the crops, \nto confirm\
    \ the data provided by agricultural weather stations \nor to get insight the free\
    \ water surface evaporation in lakes \nor dams. Agricultural irrigation scheduling\
    \ is becoming a \nvery important managerial activity whose ultimate purpose \n\
    is to achieve effective and efficient utilization of water. The \nprimary objective\
    \ of good irrigation scheduling is to apply \nthe right amount of water at right\
    \ time.\nIrrigation scheduling improves the water use efficiency \nand focus on\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods \nfor understanding of spatial variations\
    \ of ET. It determine \nirrigation applications such as identifying the water\
    \ balance \ncomponent, integrated various sensing technologies into \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling models and control, new improved \nsensor technology and integrated\
    \ water quality constraints \ninto irrigation scheduling and control [5]. Figure 1\
    \ presents \nthe six identified relevant works, indicating the smart water \n\
    management related research work such as crop water mod-\neling, soil monitoring,\
    \ water quality, drones field monitor-\ning, weather forecasting, and irrigation\
    \ scheduling.\nThe ultimate irrigation potential of India has been esti-\nmated\
    \ to be 139.5 million ha, comprising 58.5 million ha \nfrom major and medium schemes,\
    \ 15 million ha from minor \nirrigation schemes, 66 million ha from groundwater\
    \ exploi-\ntation, and an estimated 77 million ha beyond 2025 from \nfreshwater\
    \ use for irrigation [6]. It is approximated that after \ngaining the full potential\
    \ of the irrigation, nearly 50% of the \ntotal cultivated area will hold out rain-fed.\n\
    Irrigation is the most important factor for escalating the \nagricultural production\
    \ of plants. It is essential to determine \nthe quantity of water to get the optimal\
    \ benefits from the irri-\ngation, which depends on some factors such as the environ-\n\
    ment, type of crop, subsurface geo-hydrological condition, \nand the stage of\
    \ its growth.\nThe questions arise in the irrigation scheduling are as \nfollows:\
    \ (i) How to apply irrigation water?, (ii) How much \nto irrigate?, (iii) When\
    \ to irrigate. Currently, irrigation deci-\nsion-making systems are enforced to\
    \ the agricultural field \naiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is\
    \ difficult to \nbe practiced to different crops and areas. Under the grow-\n\
    ing environment, the amount of irrigation is defined as the \ndepth of water required\
    \ to meet the crop water loss through \nevapotranspiration. It can be obtained\
    \ via prediction using \nindirect channels or field measurement techniques. However,\
    \ \nthe amount and timing of water have major impact on qual-\nity of crop and\
    \ its yield. Several methods are applied for the \nirrigation scheduling such\
    \ as pan evaporation, soil moisture \nbasis, leaf water potential, and based on\
    \ growth-stages. The \ndemand of water can be fulfill by full or partial irrigation\
    \ in \nall methods.\n1.1  Motivation\nAs technology rapidly spread in a few decades,\
    \ precision \nagriculture is the key to fostering a new revolution in Irriga-\n\
    tion scheduling. The United Nations statistical data indicate \nthat agriculture\
    \ consumes 70% of the overall use of water \nworldwide, compared with 20% for\
    \ industry and 10% for \ndomestic use [8]. To ensure the proper use of water sup-\n\
    plies in irrigation we need more effective technologies. \nAutomatic irrigation\
    \ scheduling techniques replaced man-\nual irrigation which was based upon crop\
    \ water estimation. \nThe crop evapotranspiration can be determined by weather\
    \ \nparameters such as max–min temperature, humidity, wind \nspeed, solar radiations,\
    \ and even the crop factors such as the \nstage of growth, crop height, and the\
    \ soil properties for the \ndevelopment of irrigation scheduling. The machine\
    \ learning \nand deep learning advanced technologies provide direction \nand motivation\
    \ to propose a novel application on crop water \nmodeling. The influence of several\
    \ factors on crop yields and \ntemperature, precipitation have been found to have\
    \ maxi-\nmum influence on the yields of different crops [9].\n2  Reference Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\n“Evapotranspiration contains two processes, evapo-\nration in which water\
    \ is lost from the soil and plant \nsurface, and transpiration from plant surfaces\
    \ to the \natmosphere” [10].\nFig. 1  Smart water management in smart agriculture\n\
    4457\nA Survey Towards Decision Support System on Smart Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\nThe water irrigation is enforced to match the\
    \ needs of evapo-\ntranspiration of crop. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nneeds to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration accu-\nrately. Evapotranspiration\
    \ of crops differs significantly over \nthe growing season mainly due to alterations\
    \ in climatic \nconditions and crop cover. It also varies among the crops. \n\
    The information about crop water demand (i.e., ET) is a \ncrucial practical consideration\
    \ in the planning, developing, \nand working of water and irrigation management\
    \ systems. \nFigure 2 presented the concept of ETo.\nTable 1 presented the ET\
    \ that affecting by weather ele-\nment. The reference evapotranspiration is approximated\
    \ \nfrom meteorological data (humidity, temperature, wind \nrun/wind speed, sunshine\
    \ hours/solar radiation) by using \nthe Penman-Monteith equation. However, the\
    \ adjusted pan \nevaporation measurements are also used.\n2.1  Factors Affecting\
    \ ETo\nClimate and weather play crucial role in determining \nlong-term and day-to-day\
    \ activities in the agriculture. The \ndemand of crop water is determined largely\
    \ by weather vari-\nables. Rainfall is the foremost weather variable that affects\
    \ \nthe water resources development planning, irrigation plan-\nning and agricultural\
    \ cropping. The main climatic/weather \ncomponents crucial for agriculture are\
    \ rainfall, maximum/\nminimum temperature, solar radiation, sunshine duration,\
    \ \nhumidity, photo-period or sunshine hour, wind speed, and \nnight temperature\
    \ [11] as depicted in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows \nthe different empirical methods\
    \ with weather parameters for \nestimation of ETo.\nWeather elements controls\
    \ the crop water demand and \ncrop ET. The ET depends upon the different weather\

    There are various mathematical models used to calculate \nthe reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo ). The updated proce-\ndures for calculating the ETo were introduced by\
    \ FAO. The \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends the \nmethod for\
    \ calculating the ETo are as follows:\nAlthough, the method FAO-56 Penman–Monteith\
    \ \n(Allen et al. 1998) [10] is the most dominant as compared \nto others empirical\
    \ methods  [20, 21]. But, it requires sev-\neral climatic data factors [22].\n\
    The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM56) [10] has \nbeen broadly used to analyze\
    \ ETo from meteorological fac-\ntors and it is suggested as the standard technique\
    \ by the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(FAO)  [23]\
    \ and calculated by Eq. (1).\nFig. 3  Factors affecting evapo-\ntranspiration\n\

    where, ETo is the reference evapotranspiration (mm∕day−1);  \nΔ = slope of saturation\
    \ vapor pressure function (kPa °C−1 ); \nR n = net radiation (MJ m−2day−1 ); 훾\
    \ = psychometric constant \n(kPa °C−1); G = soil heat flux density (MJ m−2day−1\
    \ ); W s = \naverage 24-h wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) ; T mean = mean \nair\
    \ temperature (°C); e a = actual vapour pressure(kPa); e s \n= saturation vapour\
    \ pressure(kPa); and (es − ea ) = vapour \npressure deficit (kPa).\nHowever, ETo\
    \ can be determined accurately by this \nmethod, large scale meteorological data\
    \ requirement at spe-\ncific spatio-temporal scales (vapor pressure deficit, wind\
    \ \nspeed, minimum and maximum air temperatures, and solar \nradiation) are quite\
    \ often not available in many develop-\ning countries [24]. Thus, the alternate\
    \ models are needed to \nestimate ETo when the available data are either insufficient\
    \ \nor limited. So, it is important to explore a simpler model to \ncalculate\
    \ ETo using fewer weather properties and a reason-\nable precision.\nThe need\
    \ of crop water depends on some factors: crop \ngrowth/stages, crop type and the\
    \ climate are given in detail \n[25]:\n3  Crop Evapotranspiration ETc\n“The crop\
    \ evapotranspiration denoted as ETc,is the \ncrop water requirements or crop water\
    \ need.”\nThe need for crop water is the depth (or quantify of water \nrequired\
    \ to cope with the loss of water through evapotranspi-\nration. In other words,\
    \ water needs to be cultivated optimally \nby different crops. Crop-growth models\
    \ were developed to \nimprove the understanding of crop dynamics and to pre-\n\
    dict crop growth and production under various agronomic \nconditions [35]. The\
    \ continuous monitoring of the soil sta-\ntus water, the conditions of crop growth,\
    \ and its spatial and \ntemporal patterns will help in irrigation and precision\
    \ water \nplanning. Evaporation and transpiration variations in the \nfield and\
    \ grass crops can be integrated into dual crop coeffi-\ncient or single crop coefficient\
    \ (Kc ): a soil evaporation coef-\nficient (Ke ) and a basal crop (Kcb ) and calculated\
    \ by Eq. (2).\n3.1  Climate Based ETc\nThe combination of two different processes\
    \ by which water \nevaporates from the soil surface and transpiration from the\
    \ \nplant is referred as evapotranspiration. It is determined \n(1)\nETo =\n0.408\
    \ ⋅ Δ ⋅ (Rn − G) + 훾 ⋅\n900\nTmean+273 ⋅ u2 ⋅ (es − ea)\nΔ + 훾(1 + 0.34Ws)\n(2)\n\
    (Kc) = (Kcb) + (Ke).\nby climatic factors including solar radiation, temperature,\
    \ \nwind, and humidity as well as environmental factors. The \nevaporation account\
    \ for approximately 10% of the overall \nevapotranspiration and the transpiration\
    \ of crops constitutes \nthe remaining 90%. Hence, there is a need for crop water\
    \ \nin hot, dry, windy, and sunny areas. For the lowest values \nwhen the wind\
    \ is cold, humid, and cloudy, with little to no \nwind. Climate impact on crop\
    \ water requirements is deter-\nmined by reference crop evapotranspiration ETo\
    \ and gener-\nally expressed per unit of time in millimeters., e.g. mm/day, \n\
    mm/month, or mm/season.\n3.1.1  Crop Type\nThe effect of the crop type in daily\
    \ crop water requirements \nis often referred to as a fully grown crop; Plant\
    \ height has \nreached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally; prob-\nably\
    \ they began to flowering or developing to set grain; The \nwater demand is greatest\
    \ when the crop is fully cultivated. \nTheir water needs are called the “peak\
    \ period”.\nThe type of crop that has also affected the total growing \nduration\
    \ of crop development is known by seasonal crop \nwater need and can be obtained.\
    \ The best possible local \ndata can be obtained on the duration of the total\
    \ seasons of \nthe various plants cultivated in a region. Such data can be \n\
    collected from, for example, the seed supplier, the Exten-\nsion Service, the\
    \ Irrigation Department, or the Ministry of \nAgriculture.\n3.1.2  Growth Stages\
    \ of the Crop\nWhile planting and in the initial stage, evaporation is more \n\
    essential than transpiration. When the crop is fully devel-\noped, the need for\
    \ crop water is estimated to be 50% during \nthe mid-season phase. At the stage\
    \ of development, the crop \ndemand moderately increases from 50% of the maximum\
    \ \ncrop water requirement to the maximum crop water. Thus, \nthe maximum amount\
    \ of crop water is extended to the end \nof crop development stage, which is the\
    \ starting of mid-\nseason stage.\nThe value of K c depends on different factors\
    \ such as can-\nopy cover density, agriculture operations, weather variable, \n\
    type of crop, soil moisture, and growth stage [10]. The idea \nof crop coefficient\
    \ K c is proposed by Jensen [36] and has \nbeen improved by many researchers [37,\
    \ 38].\nHowever, K c method has the capability to determine the \nactual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration ETc precisely. According to \nthe FAO methodology, the four\
    \ growing stages of a crop are \nthe initial stage, crop development stage, mid-season\
    \ stage, \nand end-season stage (Allen et al. 1998) [10]. The crop coef-\nficient\
    \ method can be expressed as follows:\n4460\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nThe\
    \ two-step crop coefficient K c reference evapotranspi-\nration has been a successful\
    \ method to predict the evapo-\ntranspiration (ET) and crop water requirements.\
    \ The total \ngrowing period is divided into 4 growth stages shown in \nFig. 4\
    \ [39]:\n• The initial stage the period ranges from transplanting or \nsowing\
    \ till crop covers the 10% of ground.\n• The crop development stage the period\
    \ begins at the com-\npletion of the initial stage and remains until the full\
    \ ground \nhas been covered (ground cover 70–80%). It does not cer-\ntainly mean\
    \ that the crop is at its maximum height.\n• The mid-season stage the period begins\
    \ at the completion \nof the crop development stage and remains till maturity;\
    \ it \nconsists grain-setting and flowering.\n• The late-season stage the period\
    \ starts at the completion \nof mid-season stage and remains until the last day\
    \ of the \nharvest; it consists ripening.\nwhere ETc represents the requirement\
    \ of crop water (mm \nd −1 ), ETo the reference crop water requirement (mm d −1\
    \ ), \nand K c the crop coefficient and calculated by Eq. (3). \nBesides, Kingra\
    \ et al. (2004) computed crop water require-\nment for Wheat and transplanted\
    \ Rice at Ludhiana, reported \nthat the Wheat crop used about 315 mm water whereas\
    \ the \nrice crop used about 780 mm water during its growing sea-\nson [40]. Saggi\

    \ of data for the study.\n4  Irrigation Scheduling\nIn 1996, Howell explored the\
    \ effects on water use and irri-\ngation scheduling [42]. It is an application\
    \ mechanism that \ncan lead to the effective and efficient use of water. This\
    \ \nefficiency can be enhanced by using advanced methods \nof irrigation. However,\
    \ even in advanced irrigation meth-\nods, irrigation scheduling at the farm level\
    \ is required. It \nis necessary when rainfall is deficient to remunerate for\
    \ \nthe water lost by evapotranspiration. The irrigation water \nneed is described\
    \ as the crop water requirement minus the \nfruitful rainfall. It is defined in\
    \ mm/month or mm/day. The \nmain goal of good irrigation scheduling is to apply\
    \ the cor-\nrect amount of water at the right time, and make sure that \nwater\
    \ is accessible when the crop requires it.\nAccording to predetermined schedules,\
    \ the irrigation \nwater is supplied to the cultivation by keep track of the \n\
    following [43]:\n• The status of soil water;\n• The need of crop water.\nThe purpose\
    \ of our research work is to present, analyze, \nand optimize some measure of\
    \ performance of the crop \nproduction under a set of specified conditions, such\
    \ as the \nlimited or unlimited total volume of water for the growing \nseason.\
    \ The main factors that influence the solution and \nimplementation of the irrigation\
    \ scheduling problem are \nthe characteristics of climate soil, crop, irrigation\
    \ water, \nand irrigation technology.\nJudicious usage of water for crop production\
    \ needs \nknowledge of water quality, soil, weather, crop, and drain-\nage situation.\
    \ The increase in efficiency of pumping sys-\ntems and conveyance need to review.\n\
    The soil types and climatic conditions have a consid-\nerable effect on the major\
    \ practical aspects of irrigation \nsuch as how much amount of water should be\
    \ supplied and \nwhen to a selected crop.\nA time-consuming and complex process\
    \ is a precise \nestimation of the irrigation schedule [25]. However, the \nadvent\
    \ of advanced technology has made it simpler and \nthe water supply can be scheduled\
    \ precisely to meet the \nwater requirements of cultivation. The timing for irriga-\n\
    tion applications can be fixed dates or on flexible dates. \nThe quantity should\
    \ not exceed the crop requirements per \napplication, including the leaching of\
    \ salts; otherwise, \nany excess water would not only reduce the efficiency of\
    \ \nits usage but can hinder the crop development. Standard \nFig. 4  Various\

    \ performance metrics are crop yields \nand net benefits per unit area.\nThe optimal\
    \ irrigation schedule is any schedule that \noptimizes the adopted output measurement\
    \ while meeting \nseveral defined constraints. Any schedule that optimizes \n\
    the adopted measure of performance while satisfying some \nspecified constraints\
    \ is the optimal irrigation schedule.\n4.1  Methods of Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Different techniques can be apply to the plants with irriga-\ntion water and each\
    \ approach has its benefits and limita-\ntions. In this context, the best approach\
    \ to accommodate \nlocal conditions should be taken into account. Earlier, the\
    \ \nprimary irrigation method is applied via the source of supply \nsuch as a\
    \ bucket watering or a well. Although, it is a time-\nconsuming method.\nMore\
    \ advanced water application methods are used in \nlarger areas where irrigation\
    \ is needed. The suitability of \nseveral irrigation methods, i.e. sprinkler,\
    \ surface, or drip \nirrigation, depends on the following aspects: Natural condi-\n\
    tions, type of crop, type of technology, previous experience \nwith irrigation,\
    \ required labor inputs and costs and benefits.\nSurface irrigation may be categorized\
    \ based on mode of \nwater application as depicted in Fig. 5. [44] and Fig. 6\
    \ shown \nthe different types of irrigation methods. Table 3 presented \nthe different\
    \ types of irrigation methods, advantages and \ntheir applications.\nFig. 5  Irrigation\
    \ methods\nFig. 6  Types of irrigation \nscheduling\n4462\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain\
    \ \n1 3\n4.1.1  Border Irrigation\nSurface irrigation is where the water is applied\
    \ to the sur-\nface of field by gravity flow. The water is applied into small\
    \ \nchannels (furrows) or complete surface is flooded with water \n(basin irrigation)\
    \ or strips of land (borders). Border irriga-\ntion is a modern method of surface\
    \ irrigation. Borders are \nuniformly graded strips of land and long, set apart\
    \ by earth \nbunds. They are also known as border strips. There are sev-\neral\
    \ ways to fed the irrigation water to the border such as by \nusing small gates,\
    \ launching the channel bank, using spiles \nor siphons. A sheet of water is guided\
    \ by the earth bunds and \nflows down the slope of the border. It is mostly suited\
    \ to gen-\nerate long uninterrupted field lengths for facility of machine \noperations\
    \ in the huge mechanized farms. Borders can be up \nto 3-30m wide and at least\
    \ 800m in length depend on several \nfactors. It is less applicable to farms on\
    \ small-scale consist-\ning animal-powered cultivation techniques or hand labor.\n\
    4.1.2  Sprinkler Irrigation\nIt is equivalent to natural rainfall, where water\
    \ is pumped \nusing a pipe system and then rotating sprinkler heads used \nto\
    \ spray onto the crops. Further, the spray is applied into the \nair via sprinklers\
    \ to breaks it into small drops of water that \nfall on the ground. The sprinklers,\
    \ pump supply system, and \noperating conditions must be developed to apply the\
    \ water \nuniformly. It is well suited for the most field, row, and tree \ncrops.\
    \ Water can be sprayed under or over the crop canopy. \nAlthough, large sprinklers\
    \ are not suggested for delicate \ncrops such as lettuce due to the large size\
    \ water drops gen-\nerated by the sprinklers can harm the crops.\n4.1.3  Drip\
    \ Irrigation\nIt involves application of dripping water to the soil from a \n\
    small diameter plastic pipe systems attached with outlets \ncalled emitters or\
    \ drippers at very low rates (2–20 l/h). It is \nalso called as trickle irrigation.\
    \ Water is applied very close \nto plants so that only part of the soil in which\
    \ the roots grow \nis wetted, instead of sprinkler and surface irrigation, which\
    \ \nconsists wetting the complete soil profile [25]. It is well suited \nfor trees,\
    \ vine crops and row crops (vegetables, soft fruit), \nwhere one or more emitters\
    \ can be given for each plant. It is \nconsidered for high-value crops only due\
    \ to high capital costs \nrequired for installation of a drip system.\n4.1.4 \
    \ Need of Irrigation Scheduling\nHydrological, climatologist, and agronomical\
    \ processes play \nan significant part in the development of irrigation agriculture\
    \ \nproduction. These studies were mainly developed to estimate \ndaily, weekly,\
    \ or monthly evapotranspiration. The precise \napproximation of evapotranspiration\
    \ is an important process \nthat plays a key role in crop planning, deployment\
    \ and produc-\ntion of irrigation systems.\nIn recent years, several approaches\
    \ have been developed to \novercome the problems and obstacles that occur with\
    \ smart \nfarming, such as species recognition, yield prediction, disease \ndetection,\
    \ drought, crop productivity problems and irrigation \nmanagement.\nSo, there\
    \ is a great need to explore more research studies \nto enhance the scalability\
    \ of irrigation scheduling based on \nadvanced data analytic and machine learning.\
    \ Some research \nhas been done in the decision support system to improve the\

    \ Irrigation Scheduling Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\n5  Decision Support System\n\
    The idea of a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation \nwater management\
    \ is introduced in the 1970’s to assist \nusers in complex decision- making processes\
    \ and efficient \nuse of irrigation water at the farm level [53].\nDecision support\
    \ system (DSS) has great potential \nin agriculture era, if the water irrigation\
    \ management \nresearch is combined with the modeling approach using \nmachine\
    \ learning analytics and agriculture statistical, \nthe research level will be\
    \ achieved in different levels of \nthe agricultural development sector. The decision\
    \ sup-\nport system for crop water irrigation scheduling based on \ncrop water\
    \ model by estimation of evapotranspiration as \nweather parameter, historical\
    \ dataset, and using of differ-\nent Irrigation water management methods.\nThe\
    \ decision support system is an integrated approach \nto solve complex problems,\
    \ combining the computer cal-\nculation and data storage capacities with human\
    \ language \nand perception, support of mathematical model statistics, \nproviding\
    \ decision-maker. It is known as a primary tool \nin management for better decision\
    \ making and environ-\nmental resources. In 1985, Guariso et al. firstly intro-\n\
    duced the concept of DSS. Various researchers surveyed \nthe advanced use of the\
    \ management of DSS for water \nresources [54]. Today, it is required for the\
    \ on-farm irri-\ngation water management due to its use of the computer \nto relate\
    \ soil, crop, and water quality conditions. It can be \nused for analyzing and\
    \ determining how much water is \nneeded and when it should give next time.\n\
    5.1  Statistics\nThe statistical approach leads to the process of collection,\
    \ \npresentation, analyze, and apply the data to make deci-\nsions, problems solving,\
    \ design products, and processes. It \nis very useful for us to explore the description\
    \ and under-\nstand the variability. Statistical methods contributed for \nmaking\
    \ scientific judgments in the face of variation uncer-\ntainty. Russo et al. (2015)\
    \ Bayesian method is used to esti-\nmate the hydrological properties and irrigation\
    \ needs for \nan under-constrained mass balance model. They presented \nan approach\
    \ Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm to solve \nfor spreading of values for each\
    \ unknown parameter in a \nconceptual mass balance model [55].\n5.2  Machine Learning\n\
    From the last decade, machine learning and data analytics is \na hot-spot research\
    \ area in the domain of agriculture. Among \nthe other definitions, machine learning\
    \ is described as the \nscientific are that allows the machines to learn without\
    \ being \nstrictly programmed [56].\nMachine learning models have demonstrated\
    \ excellent \nresults for crop-based modeling in recent days. There is a \nvariety\
    \ of machine learning models based on prediction \nfor reference crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ The main contri-\nbution of our research prediction, by applying machine-\n\
    learning and data analytics based modeling to predict crop \nevapotranspiration.\n\
    Yamaç and Todorovic [57], revealed the satisfactory out-\nputs of ML with R2 ranged\
    \ from 0.81 to 0.97 [58] by apply-\ning several ML models on the climatic data.\
    \ A comparative \nanalysis was performed by Shiri et al. [59] to estimate the\
    \ \nETo using various intelligent models, namely ANN, ANFIS, \nsupport vector\
    \ machine (SVM), and GEP. In the domain \nof agriculture, big data analytic technologies\
    \ have offered \nnewly predictive models for ETo estimation, e.g. generalized\
    \ \nneuro-fuzzy models [60], artificial neural network (ANN), \n[61], adaptive\
    \ neuro-fuzzy inference system [62], multi-layer \nPerceptrons neural network\
    \ (MLPNN), Zaji and Bonakdari \n[63], extreme learning machine (ELM) Abdullah\
    \ et al. [64], \nmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and least \n\
    square support vector regression (LSSVM) [65], GRNN \n(2016), ELM, WNN and GANN\
    \ [66]. Moreover, the Auto-\nML technique is found to show excellence in application\
    \ of \nirrigation scheduling where border irrigation and sprinkler \nirrigation\
    \ methods are deployed.\n5.3  Deep Learning\nThe deep learning technique is now\
    \ practical to address mil-\nlions or even billions of weights among neurons for\
    \ better \nunderstanding of behaviors due to current advances in com-\nputational\
    \ power, in terms of software, hardware and parallel \nprocessing. It is accepted\
    \ to have established a revolutionary \nera since it can address the issues that\
    \ have countered AI for \na long time.\nDeep feed-forward neural networks are\
    \ based on multi-\nlayer Perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko \n\
    and Lapa in 1965 [67]. It can be used to model the com-\nplicated relationship\
    \ between input and output due of its \nhigh hierarchical structure model training,\
    \ construction and \nfeature learning [68]. It has been used in the hydrological\
    \ \nand agricultural fields because of the difficulty of software \ndata availability,\
    \ costs, and complexity, e.g., approximation \nand modeling of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ [42], Wang et al. \n(2018) determined that traditional ML and DL models are\
    \ \nequivalent as a data-driven artificial intelligence method that \ncan be used\
    \ to model the complicated relationship between \ninput and output [68]. However,\
    \ DL has a benefit over tra-\nditional ML, due to wits high hierarchical structure\
    \ model.\n4464\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\n5.4  Big Data Analytics\nBig Data\
    \ is a fascinating new field at the joint of advanced \nanalytics, data science,\
    \ statistics, and machine learning. Big \ndata and analytics have tremendous development\
    \ benefits \nin the agriculture economy. Advanced big data analytics \nhave improved\
    \ the tools and technologies that changed the \nway of real-time applications\
    \ to make better decision pro-\ncessing, high-performance platform to efficiently\
    \ analyze, \ncapturing, storing and managing large scale of big data. In \naddition,\
    \ agriculture practices are becoming increasingly \ndata-derived and data-enabled\
    \ with the recent development \nof 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things\
    \ and big data \ntechnologies [69]. To obtain insights from these data Saggi \n\
    et al. [70] investigated the state-of-the-art framework for \ndecision-making\
    \ and different methods of integrating big \ndata analytical methods with smart\
    \ applications such as \nsmart agriculture, healthcare, and cyber security. Figure 7\

    \ In India, ground-water (GW) is an essential \nsource of water supply in agriculture\

    \ \nwater need approximately 73% with GW in Punjab. India is \na seventh largest\
    \ subcontinent country by geographical area \nin South Asia, nowadays India ranks\

    \ in the tropical climate areas. Central Indian Pun-\njab is a well-known for\
    \ its agriculture activities and occupied \nhigh percentage of land area in all\
    \ over India.\n6.1  A Bibliometric Perspective of Irrigation \nScheduling\nIn\
    \ this section, the articles from Science direct digital data-\nbase is considered.\
    \ Figure 8 shows the number of papers \npublished from 1995 to 2021 in field of\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning, reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspira-\n\
    tion. We have selected only elsevier science direct library \nto find out research\
    \ articles, where we found 34,083 results \nin area of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ 32,775 papers in reference \nevapotranspiration and 14,261 results articles\
    \ in crop evapo-\ntranspiration (crop water need).\nIrrigation scheduling, ETo\
    \ and ETc trends are represented \nby Green, Blue, and Yellow colored lines respectively.\
    \ Fig-\nure 8 shows the article type in which review reports, case \nreports,\
    \ data articles, mini review, and many more articles. \nFigure 8 shows the number\
    \ of top-journal publications. \nSeveral computer simulation techniques and decision\
    \ sup-\nport systems have been developed to estimate ETo , ETc and \nCrop Water\
    \ Requirement (CWR). It is important to identify \nchanges in the hydrological\
    \ cycle when we want to predict \nthe impacts of climate change. However, current\
    \ studies on \nclimate change must be expanded to cover the entire globe. \nThe\
    \ two main components of the global water cycle are \nevaporation and precipitation.\n\
    Methods for measuring evapotranspiration from meteoro-\nlogical data include a\
    \ number of climatology, and the physi-\ncal inputs which is directly estimated\
    \ in weather stations. \nOther parameters are associated with measured data and\
    \ can \nbe obtained by directly or empirical methods. Meteorologi-\ncal data can\
    \ be expressed in several units.\n6.2  Estimation and Forecasting \nof Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\nThe application of Evapotranspiration (ETo ) in irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ is divided into different categories for literature \nsection such as statistical,\
    \ machine learning, evolutionary \nmodels, and decision support system [42, 71,\
    \ 72]. We have \npresented a comprehensive review literature for reference \n\
    evapotranspiration as follows:\nFigure 9 presented the process of DSS for crop\
    \ water irri-\ngation scheduling. ETo is an imperative aspect of the hydro-\n\
    logical cycle that is stirring water availability on the earth \nsurface. It is\
    \ one of the significant criteria of accurate quan-\ntification of crop water\
    \ requirement that influence various \nhydrological processes, planing of water\
    \ management and \nresources [62], and requirement of irrigation [73]. Tradition-\n\
    ally, the ETo is estimated at the field scale, but it consumes \nlot of time and\
    \ is difficult to process by complex mathemati-\ncal calculations with various\
    \ climatic variables. Methods \nfor measuring evapotranspiration from meteorological\
    \ data \ninclude a number of climatology, and the field inputs which \nis directly\
    \ estimated in weather stations. Some parameters \nare associated with measured\
    \ data, where as others can be \nobtained directly or through empirical methods.\n\
    6.2.1  Existing Methods Based on Empirical\nSince many years, various researchers\
    \ have established \nreference evapotranspiration ETo estimation with empiri-\n\
    cal methods. There are few categories of ETo estimation \nmethods: Temperature-based,\
    \ Radiation-based, Empirical, \nPan, and many more. Commonly, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith\
    \ \nmethod is applied as the scientific, standard and temperature \nbased method\
    \ to estimate the ETo [10, 74]. FAO-PM has \nbeen extensively adopted because\
    \ to its positive outcomes \nin a variety of climates across the world. However,\
    \ it needs \na significant amount of meteorological data obtained from \nregular\
    \ meteorological observation stations [75].\nTo overcome the existing limitation\
    \ of the FAO-PM \nmodel, various attempts aiming to estimate ETo with limited\
    \ \nobserved data have been made. A large number of studies \nhave focused on\
    \ estimating ETo using empirical methods \nwith limited ground-level data such\
    \ as the Hargreaves and \nSamani equation, Priestley-Taylor equation, and Thorn-\n\
    thwaite equation have been used for estimating (ETo ) by \nTomas-Burguera et al.\
    \ [76].\nETo is estimated with simplified or empirical methods \n(e.g. Lysimetric\
    \ measurements) and it is highly difficult to \nachieve more precise and robust\
    \ approaches [77, 78]. HS \nequation is the most simple and accurate approach\
    \ based on \ntemperature [10, 31]. There are many empirical approaches \nto predict\
    \ the ETo using five mass transfer-based models \n(Ivanov, WMO, Penman, Trabert,\
    \ and Mahringer), five \nradiation-based approach (Tu, PT, Ab, JH, and Mk), and\
    \ \nfive temperature-based approach (HS, modified Hargreaves-\nSamani1 ) (Th,\
    \ BC, MHS1 , and MHS2 ) [79]. Table 4 shows \nthe literature of empirical methods\
    \ for estimation of ETo.\nMalamos et al. [80] investigated the monthly Geo-spa-\n\

    \ Methods Based on Machine Learning\nThere have been many studies on hybrid models\
    \ with \nmachine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to estima-\ntion of ETo\
    \ with few climate parameters around the world.\nPatil and Deka [85] investigated\
    \ the performance of \nextreme machine learning (ELM) to quantify the weekly \n\
    ETo in the Thar Desert of India. Also, they have showed \nthe comparison of Artificial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN) with \nthree input variable. The ELM model gives slightly\
    \ higher \naccuracy than empirical, and ANN models.\nWu et al. [86] proposed hybrid\
    \ model using machine \nlearning and soft-computing to estimate the monthly ETo\
    \ in \nsouth China with 26 data stations. The proposed (Kmeans-\nFFA-KELM) approach\

    offer farmers with appropriate decision-making tools in \norder to regulate the\
    \ amount of water supplied to crops.\nA decision support system PETP V2.0.0 is\
    \ developed to \nanalysis and estimate the potential evapotranspiration ETo \n\
    using various empirical approaches namely Hargreaves, \nJensen-Haise, Penman-Monteith,\
    \ Priestley-Taylor, etc. Vis-\nual Studio 2010 software is used to build the computational\
    \ \ntool to estimate the accurate results for water requirement \nof crop [148].\n\
    Navarro et al. [149] developed smart irrigation DSS for \nmanaging the irrigation\
    \ scheduling. They purposed 2 ML \ntechniques i.e. PLSR and ANFIS. Maximum and\
    \ mini-\nmum relative humidity, temperature, and direction of wind, \nglobal radiation,\
    \ vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, dew point \nare the variables used to predict\
    \ the daily ETo with FAO \nPenman–Monteith method. Zizhong and Zenghui [150] pre-\n\
    sented a single irrigation system that enhanced higher corn \nproduction and also\
    \ provided efficiency in use of water in \nNortheast China. They include climate\
    \ parameters namely \naverage, max and min of air temperatures, max and min of\
    \ \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours from 1980 \nto 2012. Penman–Monteith\
    \ approach is used to determine \nthe soil evaporation and ETc.\nThe knowledge\
    \ of the irrigation management has an \nimpact on crop water requirements, maintaining\
    \ water bal-\nance and is the practical considerations to enhance produc-\ntivity\
    \ of crop [157]. Various research work in Punjab have \ndemonstrated the requirements\
    \ of crop water irrigation, irri-\ngation water based on ET and pan evaporation,\
    \ [158], but \nfew studies have focused on Soil Water Deficit (SWD) [159].\nParaskevopoulos\
    \ and Singels [151] investigated the inte-\ngrated content of soil water recordings\
    \ of real-time field into \nthe MyCanesim system to estimate its use in 15 sugarcane\
    \ \nfields of South Africa for supporting irrigation system. It is \nused to determine\
    \ the decision making for irrigation sched-\nuling based on the status of forecasts\
    \ of crop, soil water, \nand the next irrigation date. Ying et al. [152] represented\
    \ \nthe evaluation for summer Wheat and winter Maize crop-\nping system for optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Further, they \ndescribed topical versions of the SWAP\
    \ and Wofost models \nfor crop growing simulation and obtaining efficiency in\
    \ use \nof water.\nAfzal et al. [160] improved water resources management \nusing\
    \ different irrigation strategies and water qualities by \nfield, and modeling\
    \ study. To deficit irrigation PRD and RDI \nmethods are used to estimate the\
    \ effects of waste and fresh \nwater on salinity distribution, soil moisture,\
    \ and crop yield \nof Potato, Maize in Italy, Bologna through field experiments.\n\
    The fuzzy, evolutionary, and machine learning models \nare used to develop a DSS\
    \ model for irrigation schedul-\ning. Gaiqiang et al. [135] developed a FIS-DSS\
    \ software \nbased on knowledge, interface for user, and an inference \nengine\
    \ for wheat, corn and cotton crops. It is a fuzzy interval \n4472\n \nM. K. Saggi,\
    \ S. Jain \n1 3\nprogramming model having multiple objectives and con-\nstraints,\
    \ flexibility of model, data processing, and an alterna-\ntive solving algorithm.\
    \ The main objective is to maximize \nthe economic-based benefits for crop-land\
    \ in China. The NN \nmodel is used to train the model with precipitation and his-\n\
    torical climate parameters.\nGiusti and Marsili-Libelli [153] developed a fuzzy-DSS\
    \ \nto schedule the daily irrigation need of crop based on soil \nmoisture as\
    \ a predictive model and an inference model \nas irrigation decision maker. This\
    \ model determines the \nactual need of water for kiwi, corn, and potato crops\
    \ with \npast irrigation soil moisture, climatic parameters, and ETc . \nThey\
    \ used meteorological data including temperature, solar \nradiation, wind, rain,\
    \ etc. The objective of FDSS model is \nto reduce the water usage and provide\
    \ the efficient result in \nterms of saving water up-to 13.55, 18.3, and 72.95\
    \ water \nunits for irrigating three crops respectively. Sahoo et al. \n[161]\
    \ proposed fuzzy multi objective linear programming \napproach for planing of\
    \ land-water-crop system. The mete-\norological data like daily rainfall, evaporation,\
    \ temperature, \nsolar radiation, daily sunshine hours, humidity, wind veloc-\n\
    ity, and albedo are collected from the Central Rice Research \nInstitute, Cuttack.\
    \ The objective function is to optimize, \nmaximized crop production, net return,\
    \ and to minimize the \nlabor requirement for various vegetables and pulses.\n\
    Reddy and Kumar [162] demonstrated a multi-objective \nmethod for the optimal\
    \ crop pattern and multi-crop irriga-\ntion reservoir scheme by several procedures.\
    \ Adeyemo and \nOtieno [163] explored a method to solve the multi objective \n\
    crop planning model by an evolutionary algorithm. They \nhave found excellent\
    \ results in minimizing total water irri-\ngation, maximizing the yield productivity,\
    \ and net income \nfrom farming.\nIrrigation water management is numerically intensive\
    \ \nfor computations and provides model interpretation and \ndiscretization. Neural\
    \ networks and evolutionary algo-\nrithms demonstrated to estimate the irrigation\
    \ volume and \nalso determined the effectiveness to diminish irrigation \napplication\
    \ and maximize production [164]. Ortega Álva-\nrez et al. [154] proposed a non-linear\
    \ model to recognize \nyield schemes and water irrigation management plannings\
    \ \nusing the genetic algorithms. Further, they estimated crop \nyield, gross\
    \ margin and production as a function of irrigation \ndepth. Schmitz et al. [165]\
    \ simulated 92 percent greater pro-\nduction for corn using evolutionary algorithm\
    \ as compared \nto dynamic programming.\nApplication and web based DSS models\
    \ are developed \nfor the irrigation water scheduling by various researchers.\
    \ \nRecently, a web-based DSS is proposed to estimate the soil-\nwater balance\
    \ for irrigation system with limited input param-\neters such as (dual crop-coefficient\
    \ and meteorological). The \nirrigation parameters are computed through soil moisture\
    \ \nand requirement of water. A web-based irrigation decision \nsupport system\
    \ is introduced with limited inputs (WIDSSLI) \nfor summer corn and winter Wheat\
    \ irrigation management \nin North China Plain (NCP) [155].\nTable 7 presents\
    \ the estimation of ETo , ETc , and irriga-\ntion with DSS systems. Antonopoulou\
    \ et al. [166] presented \nan appropriate decision support system for crops which\
    \ is \nimplemented on web-based software. They introduced this \napproach by using\
    \ the Java and PHP technologies for spe-\ncific irrigation technique and soil\
    \ improvement instructions. \nDutta et al. [167] developed a mobile application\
    \ based on \nsustainable irrigation DSS. They proposed cloud sensors \nbased approach\
    \ to evaluate the ground water usage and avail-\nability of water. This approach\
    \ includes the CSIRO sensor \nbased cloud computing organization and integrated\
    \ big data \nthat includes machine learning technologies. Bonfante et al. \n[168]\
    \ proposed an irrigation water supply management tool \nto obtain the maximum\
    \ yield of Maize with W-tens, IRRI-\nSAT, and W-Mod approaches. W-Mod and IRRISAT\
    \ models \nfound more accurate results as compared to W-Tens in terms \nof irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency.\nA Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS) \ntool\
    \ is proposed to evaluate the requirement of rice crop in \nMalaysia. They determine\

    \ proposed a SALTMED model which \nincludes the to partial root drying or deficit\
    \ irrigation, sub-\nsurface irrigation, soil nitrogen fertilizer application,\
    \ ferti-\ngation, dry matter production, plant nitrogen uptake, and \nnitrate\
    \ leaching.\nFor the model calibration and endorsement the statistical \nmeasurements\
    \ are used such as R2 coefficient, RMSE, and \npercentage error. The DIDAS software\
    \ package for irrigation \nsystem decision-making strategies of drip irrigation\
    \ systems \nis developed [46].\nA DSS framework have been introduced which includes\
    \ \n22 ETo estimation approaches using user-friendly GUI \n(Microsoft Visual Basic\
    \ 6.0) of 133 selected stations of \nIndia [170]. Potential-ETo and FAO56-PM ETo\
    \ are used to \nestimate the ETo in the Geisenheim Irrigation Scheduling \n(GS)\
    \ for vegetable crops using sprinkler irrigation [171]. \nBallesteros et al. [103]\
    \ estimated the ETo using FORETO \nsoftware with Hargreaves Samani (HS) equation\
    \ or the Pen-\nman Monteith (PM) and Artificial neural networks (ANNs) \nmodels.\
    \ Modern platforms (.NET and Java) software applied \nto calculate the daily/monthly\
    \ ETo using meteorological \nparameters [172]. There are various crop simulation\
    \ based \nmodels exists such as CropSyst [173], STICS (Brisson et al. \n1998)\
    \ [174], EPIC [175], DSSAT [176], VegSyst simulation \nmodel [177], and CERES\
    \ [178].\nA single approach, that can address all operational cir-\ncumstances\
    \ (weather information, crop growth monitoring, \nfield data, agricultural expertise\
    \ and infrastructure etc.), \nas well as the associated expenses for farmers which\
    \ may \nlimit the usage of these systems. Therefore, DSS’s for irri-\ngation scheduling\
    \ have been developed to integrating vari-\nous approaches in terms of (data collection\
    \ from meteoro-\nlogical), pre-processing techniques and modeling based on \n\
    empirical or artificial intelligence.\n9  Conclusion\nOverall agricultural systems\
    \ modeling needs to rapidly adopt \nand absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies\
    \ with \na focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating \nthose who\
    \ develop applications of their models. In spite of \nthe vast literature available,\
    \ the subject of irrigation water \nmanagement and crop water modeling for machine\
    \ learning \ntechniques are yet in its emerging phase. Although there \nis wide\
    \ literature available on statistics, machine learning, \ndecision support system\
    \ for general manifolds. To estimate \ncrop water modeling on general manifolds,\
    \ we have different \napproaches available in literature.\nMoreover, the water\
    \ balance is well-entrenched \napproach for estimating irrigation amount and time\
    \ \n(i.e. irrigation frequency) in irrigation scheduling. This \napproach is simple\
    \ to use, typically inexpensive and \nvery effective approach to estimates the\
    \ ETo , and ETc . \nThe major objective is to adopt the several approaches to\
    \ \ndevelop a flexible system that supports irrigation water \nrequirement system,\
    \ which may fit into diverse fields of \noperational activities (weather information,\
    \ field data \ncollection, crop coefficients etc.). This study provides \nan overview\
    \ of the irrigation water scheduling. It also \npresented the concept of reference\
    \ evapotranspiration \nand crop evapotranspiration for crop water modeling. It\
    \ \nalso presents the various methods of irrigation schedul-\ning. It also address\
    \ the need of decision support system \nand its various approaches that lead to\
    \ irrigation water \nmanagement.\nAcknowledgements Mandeep Kaur Saggi was supported\

    \ \n \n \nAbstract \nBig data is a collection of large volumes of data sets which\
    \ are more complicated to analyze using \nstandard data processing methods. It\
    \ also emphasizes parameters like data variety and velocity data. Big \ndata will\
    \ play a most significant role in our daily life regarding applications like healthcare\
    \ electronic \ncommerce, agriculture, telecommunication, government, and financial\
    \ trading. In the agriculture domain, \nbig data is an optimal method to increase\
    \ the productivity of farming by gathering and processing \ninformation like plant\
    \ growth, farmland monitoring, greenhouse gases monitoring, climate change, soil\
    \ \nmonitoring and so forth. Virtualization is an emerging technique that can\
    \ be combined with big data in \nagriculture. Virtualization has been used extensively\
    \ in research for a long time, the term “virtual” entities \naffecting a real-life\
    \ form. In agriculture, it has many more physical objects, sensors, and devices.\
    \ This \nphysical object is virtualized and has digital representation to store,\
    \ communicate and process via the \ninternet. The information from the virtual\
    \ object has a large volume of data which helps meaningful data \nanalysis or\
    \ aspects to make application services like decision making, problem notification,\
    \ and \ninformation handling. This paper provides a comprehensive review of big\
    \ data virtualization in the \nagriculture domain. The virtualization methodology,\
    \ and tools used by many researchers is surveyed. \nKeywords: Virtualization,\
    \ big data, agriculture, virtual object, decision-making methods \n \n \nIntroduction\
    \ \nBig data primarily consists of 3 V’S: volume, velocity, and variety. For the\
    \ specific issue of big \ndata, duration is not essential in processing using\
    \ the right technology and technique in order to expresses \nthe value [1]. Some\
    \ other characteristics of V’s are variability, veracity, value, venue, verbosity,\
    \ \nverification, visualization, validity, vocabulary, etc. The fundamental components\
    \ of big data are \nprocessed within a local computing structure using standard\
    \ approaches and techniques to handle the \ndatasets capably. Data virtualization\
    \ is a comprehensive method to deal with a large volume of data from \nvarious\
    \ sources like storage, database, system file, and primary memories. The main\
    \ advantage of data \nvirtualization includes reducing the risk of data error,\
    \ workload, development, data storage, policies and \nalso an increase in the\
    \ speed of data access. Data virtualization supports SQL virtualization for unified\
    \ \naccess, query, reporting, predictive analytics, back-end data repository like\
    \ Hadoop, and NoSQL. Virtual \ndata is present in the abstract layer and also\
    \ works in infrastructure layers. The storage and server \nplatforms are also\
    \ in multiple cloud applications. Due to the increasing complexity of big data,\
    \ we require \ndata virtualization, and its infrastructure. \nIn the agriculture\
    \ domain, the big data virtualization concept plays a significant role in a variety\
    \ of \ndata such as weather data, GPS data, soil specifics, seed, fertilizer,\
    \ and sensor data. Nowadays the growth \nof the internet as well as the development\
    \ of modern society, digital agriculture development is also \nnecessary. Big\
    \ data virtualization helps the farmer to make better decisions through decision-making\
    \ \nsupport tools or methods to attain needed resources. Agriculture plays an\
    \ important role in the growth of \nA Big Data Virtualization Role in Agriculture\

    \ 58 % of rural household in agriculture [2]. Challenges lie in \ndelivering sustainable\
    \ strong outcomes for farmers and require new ideas in agriculture. Big data \n\
    analytics and investigation deserve temporal changes in the cropping pattern in\
    \ the agriculture field. Some \nof the technology used in the agriculture field\
    \ includes satellite navigation, sensor networks, and grid \ncomputing used for\
    \ improving monitoring and decision making capabilities [3]. The decision making\
    \ \nprocess in the agriculture domain needs to grow by combining current local\
    \ environment and agro \nmonitoring in GIS (Geographic Information System) and\
    \ WSNS (Wireless Sensor Networks) [4]. \nVariation sensors used in the agriculture\
    \ domain like precision agriculture, precision farming, site specific \ncrop management,\
    \ and variable rate technology [3]. Some of the issues in a wireless sensor network\
    \ are \nenergy consumption, data acquisition, sampling, transmission, fault tolerance,\
    \ the size of nodes in the \nsensor, and sensor placement. \n \nRelated work \n\
    Goya et al. [5] described the decision making for supporting agriculture with\
    \ a cloud computing \nplatform, distributed processing, and technology in the\
    \ framework of big data. Weather data do the metric \ncalculation, and the solution\
    \ to test in the different virtual machine scenario, and configuration like a\
    \ \ncluster in helping the farmer to get a better prediction. In the future, big\
    \ weather solution replication will \nbe applied to the physical machine in the\
    \ form of clustering. \nIn MCC (Mobile Cloud Computing) for better cultivation\
    \ and marketing, Ghosh et al. [6] describes \nan application called Agro mobile\
    \ cloud computing; it mainly focuses on MCC on crop image analysis \nwhich consumes\
    \ more memory; causing high power consumption making mobile devices fail. The\
    \ idea of \nMCC is a crop image analysis that helps to limit the data storage,\
    \ processing power and server called \nAgro mobile server is established. The\
    \ application service providers demand software called Software as \na Service\
    \ (SaaS) which acts as a bridge between the cloud developer and customer where\
    \ information is \ntransferred. The advantage of this proposed work is the reduction\
    \ of the workload and complexity of \nimage processing on the cloud server. Future\
    \ work on the Agra mobile architecture could apply \nalgorithms for crop analysis,\
    \ cloudlet, virtualization concepts on Android OS and the Internet of Things \n\
    (IoT) application platform. \nHauhui et al. [7] described the VIDB (Virtualized\
    \ Information Database) used for solving issues for \nlarge agriculture data,\
    \ data replication, concurrency, transmission. It gives service in support of\
    \ \norganizations, sharing, and broadcast in agricultural research. The XML metadata\
    \ service, resource \ninformation service, resource server monitoring service\
    \ is the 3 virtualized database access interface. It \nsmartly deals with failed\
    \ storage nodes due to more scalability and fault tolerance in the database. \n\
    Xie et al. [8] presented the collection, storage, analysis and visualization of\
    \ agriculture big data. \nData collection used for getting resource from various\
    \ places like the web, sensor, and network. For \nstoring and maintaining large\
    \ data, NoSQL was efficiently utilized. MapReduce and Hadoop were used \nfor analyzing\
    \ big data and mining. Presentation of virtualization was determined based on\
    \ attributes, \nvariables and required information. It used extreme data technology\
    \ like Spoop, HDFS, Hive, Mahout, \nand Karmasphere. \nVerdouw et al. [9] presented\
    \ a virtualization concept applied to the IoT domain for food supply \nchain.\
    \ Virtualization is a well-versed approach to maintaining complexity, wherein\

    \ issues, and challenges related to improving the \nperformance of farming. It\
    \ mainly focuses on some requirements like device, sensor and communication \n\
    techniques related to the wireless sensor network in agriculture. A TWSN (Terrestrial\
    \ Wireless Sensor \nNetwork) was deployed above the surface using modern MEMS\
    \ (Micro electro mechanical system) \ntechnology, it can perform with small size\
    \ sensor at low cost. The dominant sensor node will get more \naccurate in gathering\
    \ data from the surroundings. For example, in precision agriculture, platforms\
    \ where \nWSN are performing agriculture field for self-regulation in the irrigation\
    \ system. An entire sensor \nperforms to get moisture from the soil, then makes\
    \ a decision, time in irrigation schedule in the \nagriculture domain. The decision\
    \ is sent to the sensor node that is combined with a water pump. Gutierrez \n\
    et al. 2014, described a self-regulation irrigation system using a WSNs and GPRS\
    \ system. WUSNs \n(Wireless underground sensor network) are placed in the soil,\
    \ and with a limited communication radius, \nextra nodes are needed in large fields.\
    \ The wireless sensor is high when the network coverage requires a \nlow number\
    \ of sensors. \nRisk and water management, irrigation, and improper infrastructure\
    \ are some of the issues faced by \nfarmers while cropping; it leads to reduced\
    \ crop yield and a loss for the farmer. To overcome this issue \nPatil et al.\
    \ [12] introduced smart agriculture in IoT. They have specific features namely\
    \ temperature, \nhumidity detection, soil moisture detection, wind speed, etc\
    \ that are monitored allowing the farmer to \nhandle the crop in a better way.\
    \ Shen et al. [13] describes multi-net interconnection, virtualization [14], \n\
    integration, and engineering technology as part of agriculture information and\
    \ technology development. \nThis paper aims to comprehensively review big data\
    \ virtualization’s role in agriculture. The \nremaining of this paper is organized\
    \ as follows: In the next section 2: related work. In section 3: \nImportance\
    \ of virtualization in big data and requirement of virtualization is discussed.\
    \ Section 4: \nRepresents big data in agriculture. In section 5: New trends in\
    \ big data agriculture is explained. In section \n6: the Decision-making techniques\
    \ used in big data are distinguished. In section 7: Research gaps of \nvirtualization\
    \ and finally section 8: describes the conclusion. \n \nImportance of virtualization\
    \ in big data \nFor solving challenges of big data we need a broad amount of data\
    \ distribution in storage, use of a \ncomputer, and a data-intensive application.\
    \ Virtualization affords an additional level in analyzing big data \nin reality.\
    \ Virtualization is not technically required for analysis of big data. A software\
    \ system is more \nproductive on a virtual platform. Virtualization mainly consists\
    \ of 3 characteristics for an affordable, \nscalable operating system for big\
    \ data processing [15]. \n• Partition: It affords a single physical system, it\
    \ partitions only based on available resources. \n• Isolation: Each VM is isolated\
    \ with a physical system and other virtualization. When a virtual \ninstance crashes,\
    \ other VM will not be affected. Data will not be shared between one virtual instance\
    \ and \nanother. \n• Encapsulation: VM mainly depends on a single file, it is\
    \ easy to find based on the service \nprovider. \n \nRequirement for using virtualization\
    \ \nFigure 1 shows the wireless sensor network distributed on the field for agriculture\
    \ applications. \nMainly the field consists of sensor nodes that supply information\
    \ with the application, particularly on the \nsensor board. The nodes in the field\
    \ sensor network transmit using Radio Frequency (RF), links of \nIndustrial, Scientific\
    \ and Medical (ISM) and radio bands. Then the gateway nodes provide both RF and\
    \ \nGSM (global system for mobile communications). A remote user will monitor\
    \ the agricultural field and \npower on the field sensor and actuator devices.\
    \ For example, a user can switch on/off or pump/value the \nA Big Data Virtualization\

    \ to reach some threshold value. Users will move forward to a mobile \nphone to\
    \ monitor and control the on-field sensors. It connects through GPRS and SMS (Short\
    \ message \nservice). Simultaneously information gets an update from the sensor\
    \ and system to power both types of \nuser. For saving time, resource optimization,\
    \ reduce power system, installation of software quickly in the \nenvironment,\
    \ and maintenance, utilization of the CPU increases from 15 to 80 % [16]. \n \n\
    \ \n \nFigure 1 Big data virtualization in agriculture. \n \n \nRole of big data\
    \ in agriculture \nMost of the data from sensors depends on the moisture, nutrients,\
    \ atmospheric, and pressure. \nSensors help the farmer to locate density seeding\
    \ for optimizing sowing. Local conditions help to find the \nregions where more\
    \ water and fertilizer are needed. Self-driving vehicles give data regarding the\
    \ location, \nfuel, consumption, and fertilizer, provided by IoT, or telematics.\
    \ Farm machinery can be implemented \nwithout any help. Most of the issues in\
    \ agriculture are due to instability; change in climate, soil erosion, \nand loss\
    \ of biodiversity. The current agriculture system quickly becomes complex when\
    \ the economic \nproblems, nutrition factors and ecological conditions are taken\

    \ data \nA crop assists the farmer to change the soil for an alternate approach\
    \ for cultivating shallow root \ncrops. A crop of plant food is tapped in various\
    \ depths at a different time. The advantage of control of \nweeds, pests, and\
    \ disease, is that soil fertility is maintained. Resource-constrained agriculture\
    \ crop \nscheduling has the advantage in being time-consuming, complicated process\
    \ in determining accuracy in \nthe irrigation process. Irrigation is based on\
    \ the duration of water for demand, the various types of soil, \nand the geographic\
    \ climate [2]. \n \nBig data in digital agriculture using satellite data \n• Disruptive\
    \ technologies: Potential in farming productivity in agriculture is suitable for\
    \ the \nremote satellite. Target design innovation in service and strategies in\
    \ management. By combining these \nestimates information can be provided on the\
    \ scale the cropping region, the potential yield and the gap. \nThe yield is based\
    \ on climate, nutrient stress, etc. Annual crop estimates are based on the production\
    \ of \nfood proportional to the area cropped. The measuring conditions affect\
    \ the estimated crop yield in a \nspecific time and space. Remote sensor data,\
    \ soil data, climate, weather conditions and stage model in the \ngrowth of crop\
    \ development in performance outcomes depends on the scenario range in management\
    \ and \nenvironment, and the measure yield can perform in the remaining season\
    \ [22]. \n \n• Types of sensor used in big data agriculture \nAgricultural sensors\
    \ are required in subtle weather conditions and need to be strong. Most of the\
    \ \nsensors available in the market are suitable for one type of cultivation.\
    \ Selection of a sensor is mainly \naffected by quality, infrastructure, the range\
    \ of measurement, and response time. Input parameters, \nmaterial type, technology,\
    \ transduction are some of the variations in the sensor. The DHT11 sensor will\
    \ \nmeasure both temperature and humidity at the same time. Some of the sensors\
    \ that measure automatically \nuse electromagnetic, optical, mechanical, electrochemical,\
    \ airflow, and acoustic sensors [23]. \n \nComparison of the soil-related sensor\

    \ attributes, the big data framework and machine learning algorithm play a \n\
    critical role. It includes 1) To get optimum decisions for farming, 2) crop and\

    \ 2019; 16(2) \n \n62 \n• Optimized farming \nWeather, monsoon behavior, groundwater\
    \ scarcity, soil conditions, labor and machinery cost, \nintercropping decision,\
    \ pest’s management are some attributes used to prepare in advance and are \n\
    associated with big data technology and machine learning algorithms. All the characteristics\
    \ that relate to \nmaking an optimized decision in various stages of farming.\
    \ \nThe optimized decision can take by decision farming based on weather, soil,\
    \ crop cutting, plant \nhealth, pest management and intercropping. The decision\
    \ taken at every stage to ensure profitability, low \nproduction cost, reducing\
    \ farmer’s risk, high productivity, no pesticide residue is assured and efficient\
    \ use \nof land, machinery, labor and time. \n \n• Commodity pricing \nFarmer\
    \ get an advantage from forecasted agriculture commodity prices and sharing the\
    \ present \nprices of agriculture commodities. \n \n• Forecasted agriculture commodity\
    \ process \nThe price of commodities move substantially in semi-arid farming and\
    \ monsoon farming zones. The \nlocal government inputs price moves due to the\
    \ decision like MSP (Minimum Selling Price). \n \n• Sowing decision by a farmer\
    \ \nThe price forecasting information assists the farmer to know about the right\
    \ price in advance to \nmake an appropriate decision whether to sow a specific\
    \ crop or not. \n \n• A policy decision by the government \nThe price forecasting\
    \ information plays as input to government and other authorities to decide on\
    \ \nthe minimum selling price. \n \n• Sharing the current commodity prices \n\
    Information may allow a farmer in many ways namely automation of email or SMS\
    \ alerts, by \nutilizing a mobile or internet app, and advertising in media through\
    \ media analytics. \n \nA new trend in big data agriculture \nDrones: Also called\
    \ an UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). For many reasons, it is used in most \n\
    industries. UAVs are essential and economical in capturing data. Previous data\
    \ is only available from \naircraft satellite images. The orthomorphic model can\
    \ implement definite drones it can be synced with the \nprogram, and it creates\
    \ the maps. The map can transform with the same applicator it saves more time\
    \ and \nthe effort for farmers [27]. Cloud computing, wireless sensors, communication,\
    \ network technology, \nembedded system, data mining and NANO, IPv6 are some of\
    \ the essential things to provide to a farmer \nfor innovating in agriculture\
    \ and in getting innovation technologies. \nSensor: In agriculture, sensors used\
    \ most frequently in many ways like the availability of water, \nsoil, measuring\
    \ the temperature of the leaf, detecting disease and insects. The central concept\
    \ behind the \nsensor makes farmers cut down on the unwanted application. Maps\
    \ can show regions of the field where \nthe moisture is okay, hence no need for\
    \ water at that time. This type of data helps the farmer to save time, \nresources,\
    \ and money. \nData analysis: Farmers to check the history of fields, crops, and\
    \ health issues before they sow. \nFarmers use the analysis in making a decision,\
    \ helping them to improve their yield and get more benefit. \nTechnology Adaptation:\
    \ Big data technologies need to be adapted from the initial stage to the final\
    \ \nstage of crop cultivation which is shown in Figure 2 [28]. \nBig Data: The\
    \ farmer needs to understand the challenges of big data, tools, and technology\
    \ from the \nlocal level. This approach takes more time, practice, and error.\
    \ The performance of big data is efficient \nand is valuable in agriculture. Future\
    \ precision agriculture needs to perform essential/mandatory tasks; the \nbasis\
    \ depends on timing, location, data [28]. \nA Big Data Virtualization Role in\

    \ \nWalailak J Sci & Tech 2019; 16(2) \n \n63 \nBiological: Most of the chemical\
    \ factories rely on elements like weeds, insects, and diseases to \nperform in\
    \ the biological organism [28]. \nRegulation: Due to preventative trends in agriculture,\
    \ the farmer gets enormous pressure in \nhandling entire commodity and product\
    \ grown based on demands. Need to have changes and modification \nin the cultivation\
    \ of crops in the future. Producers and consumers have more issues than cost only.\
    \ It \nrequires more than 2 years for constructing the regulation and innovation\
    \ in DB. Water needs have been \nappropriately maintained by a farmer only [28].\
    \ \nDemands: When population increases beyond 9 billion by 2050, we get more demand\

    Decision-making techniques in big data \n• Mathematical techniques: It supports\
    \ in stages like data curation and data analysis. The central \nconcept of decision\
    \ making depends on the relationship, correlation, and samples in the statistical\
    \ \napproach. Innovation implements for maintaining large data using parallel\
    \ statistics, statistical computing, \nand learning [47]. Optimization method\
    \ used for solving issues at more cost for memory, time \nconsumption data reduction\
    \ [48] and parallelism respectively. Real-time optimization can define the \n\
    decision-making problem for the vast scale wireless network [49] and intelligent\
    \ transportation system \n[50]. \n• Data analysis technique: It mainly consists\
    \ of data mining, machine learning, and neural \nnetworks. Most of them can process\
    \ big data. Data mining is categorised into classification, clustering, \nand\
    \ regression. It hides knowledge and pattern from the given data [51]. Many classifications\
    \ and \nclustering algorithms have substantial data samples as a fuzzy based system,\
    \ and a clustering colossal \napplication algorithm. Fuzzy reasoning provides\
    \ uncertainty in both data and output. \n• Machine learning: It is another artificial\
    \ intelligence technique that allows both supervised and \nunsupervised methods.\
    \ A machine learning algorithm like SVM improves the performance of a large-\n\
    scale parallel system like map/reduces. It will be used by many applications like\
    \ biological [52] and \nsensor data [53]. \n• Artificial neural network: Mostly\
    \ applied in pattern recognition and adaptive control. The main \nchallenges lie\
    \ in neural network layers, nodes, performance, and memory and time consumption\
    \ in the \nneural network. Sampling techniques used for reducing the size of data.\
    \ Neural networks are applied in \nparallel and distributed setting [54]. \n•\
    \ Visualization: Nowadays the representation of data is too complicated. Its particular\
    \ focus on \nsignificant data and try to identify the proper description of data\
    \ [55]. Feature extraction provides a \nreduction in the size of data [56]. Thompson\
    \ et al. [55] show the presentation of data in a compact yet \ninformative approximation\
    \ for massive data. \n• Cloud computing: The cloud provides services like platform,\
    \ infrastructure, decision-making \nsoftware. Data management, data quality, data\
    \ currency is the main issues in cloud decision making. \nDemirk and Delen [57]\
    \ presented data, information; analytics are described as a service-oriented decision\
    \ \nsupport system. \nA Big Data Virtualization Role in Agriculture \nSandeepkumar\
    \ MATHIVANAN and Prabhu JAYAGOPAL \nhttp://wjst.wu.ac.th \nWalailak J Sci & Tech\
    \ 2019; 16(2) \n \n66 \n• Fuzzy sets and system: Related to the GrC (Granular\
    \ Computing) technique, it is more useful \nfor a solving a big data. They are\
    \ some techniques in fuzzy sets like neutral fuzzy classifiers [58], big data\
    \ \nclassification represents the linguistic fuzzy rule-based classifier. For\
    \ clustering of big data the most \nuseful algorithm use a Fuzzy C-system. The\
    \ fuzzy interface system, the Bayesian process [59], a fuzzy \nquery system is\
    \ used for the pattern recognition algorithm. For reducing dimensionality a fuzzy\
    \ neural \nclassifier is used. \n \nResearch gaps \n1. Change management is an\
    \ open research problem where the change is not applicable to all kinds \nof application.\
    \ The difference does not exist in user sharing of the same virtualization service.\
    \ \n2. Nowadays, more complex analytic models, rules, information converge exists\
    \ in big data. \n3. Research should focus on the development of the infrastructure\
    \ framework because of some \nundefined virtual architectures. \n4. Data volumes\
    \ have increased to a terabyte, petabyte and beyond. In information technology,\
    \ the \nvolume is a big challenge to store the data in the form of logical tables,\

    \ \nAgriculture development based on virtualization tools, virtualization platforms,\
    \ techniques, methods, \ntools, platform, and infrastructure is studied. A significant\
    \ data source gathered, and value extracted for \nmaking better decisions and\
    \ helping farmers to increase their production. Researchers are primarily \nfocused\
    \ on single VM's and sensors. The current trend in agriculture is WSNs performing\
    \ in agriculture \nand farming surroundings, patterns work on irrigation management,\
    \ vineyard production monitoring, and \npredicting crop disease. Some factors\
    \ needs to improve including cost, autonomous operation, \nintelligence, portability,\
    \ low maintenance, energy efficiency, interoperability and so forth. Also some\
    \ of \nthe challenges and specific issues in the Indian scenario of using WSNs\
    \ in agriculture. More cost used in \nthe sensor, variable climate, and soil it\
    \ is a crucial part in structuring the WSNs based framework for \nagriculture\
    \ in India with various climates and types of soil. Some parameters required to\
    \ tune the function \naccurately for each different location. The segmented land\
    \ structure is based on WSNs used in \nagriculture. It is similar to irrigation\
    \ management. Also, some challenges include requirement of a farmer, \noverall\
    \ plan, and maintenance. \n \nAcknowledgment \nA special note of thanks to the\

    \ advancing over the past few years. This advancement\nis attributed to the increased\
    \ innovation and availability of new technologies which can enable the\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping of complex plant traits. The application of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ in\nvarious domains of science has also grown exponentially in recent years.\
    \ Notably, the computer\nvision, machine learning, and deep learning aspects of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence have been successfully\nintegrated into non-invasive\
    \ imaging techniques. This integration is gradually improving the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ data collection and analysis through the application of machine and deep learning\
    \ for\nrobust image analysis. In addition, artiﬁcial intelligence has fostered\
    \ the development of software\nand tools applied in ﬁeld phenotyping for data\
    \ collection and management. These include open-\nsource devices and tools which\
    \ are enabling community driven research and data-sharing, thereby\navailing the\
    \ large amounts of data required for the accurate study of phenotypes. This paper\
    \ reviews\nmore than one hundred current state-of-the-art papers concerning AI-applied\
    \ plant phenotyping\npublished between 2010 and 2020. It provides an overview\
    \ of current phenotyping technologies and\nthe ongoing integration of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence into plant phenotyping. Lastly, the limitations of the\ncurrent\
    \ approaches/methods and future directions are discussed.\nKeywords: artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence; deep learning; plant phenomics; ﬁeld phenotyping; high through-\n\
    put phenotyping; image-based phenotyping\n1. Introduction\nAccording to data from\
    \ the United Nations, the world population is expected to grow\nto nine billion\
    \ by 2050 [1]. With the increasing need for food production to match the\nprojected\
    \ population growth in order to prevent food insecurity, plant phenotyping is\n\
    now at the forefront of plant breeding as compared to genotyping [2]. Plant phenotyping\n\
    is deﬁned as the assessment of complex traits such as growth, development, tolerance,\n\
    resistance, architecture, physiology, ecology, yield, and the basic measurement\
    \ of individual\nquantitative parameters that form the basis for complex trait\
    \ assessment [2]. Scientists\nare increasingly interested in the use of phenomic-level\
    \ data to aid in the correlation\nbetween genomics and the variation in crop yields\
    \ and plant health [3–5]. In this way, plant\nphenotyping has become an important\
    \ aspect of crop improvement, availing data to assess\ntraits for variety selection\
    \ in order to identify desirable traits and eliminate undesirable\ntraits during\
    \ the evaluation of plant populations [6]. Plant phenotyping has improved\nprogressively\
    \ over the past 30 years, although obtaining satisfactory phenotypic data for\n\
    complex traits such as stress tolerance and yield potential remains challenging\
    \ [7]. The\nlarge data required for the effective study of phenotypes has led\
    \ to the development and\nuse of high-throughput phenotyping technologies to enable\
    \ the characterization of large\nnumbers of plants at a fraction of the time,\
    \ cost, and labor of previously used traditional\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134363\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n2 of 19\ntechniques.\
    \ Traditional techniques previously required destructive measurements whereby\n\
    crops were harvested at particular growth stages in order to carry out genetic\
    \ testing and\nthe mapping of plant traits [8]. Since crop breeding programs require\
    \ repeated experimental\ntrials in order to ascertain which traits are of interest,\
    \ the process was slow, costly and\nsigniﬁcantly lagging behind the DNA sequencing\
    \ technologies which are necessary for\ncrop improvement [9].\nHigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping has been fostered by non-invasive imaging techniques,\nwhich have\
    \ enabled the visualization of plant cell structures on a wider scale. As these\n\
    imaging technologies develop, images carry more useful extractable information\
    \ that sup-\nports biological interpretations of plant growth [10,11]. These techniques\
    \ include thermal\nimaging [12], chlorophyll ﬂuorescence [13,14], digital imaging\
    \ [15], and spectroscopic\nimaging [16].\nHigh-throughput phenotyping techniques\
    \ are currently being used to enable data\nacquisition in both laboratory and\
    \ ﬁeld settings. They are being employed at the levels of\ndata collection, data\
    \ management, and analysis. They include imaging sensors, growth\nchambers, data\
    \ management and analysis software, etc. [7,17–20]. The integration of\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence into these technologies has contributed to the development of the\
    \ non-\ninvasive imaging aspect of phenomics. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies\
    \ in the form\nof computer vision and machine learning are increasingly being\
    \ used to acquire and analyze\nplant image data. Computer vision systems process\
    \ digital images of plants to detect\nspeciﬁc attributes for object recognition\
    \ purposes [21]. Machine learning employs various\ntools and approaches to ‘learn’\
    \ from large collections of crop phenotypes in order to classify\nunique data,\
    \ identify new patterns and features, and predict novel trends [22,23]. Recent\n\
    advancements in deep learning, a subset of machine learning, have provided promising\n\
    results for real-time image analysis. Deep learning is a machine learning approach\
    \ that\ntakes advantage of the large plant datasets available and uses them to\
    \ carry out image\nanalysis using convolutional neural networks [24]. In ﬁeld\
    \ phenotyping, AI is being applied\nin ﬁeld equipment for ground and obstacle\
    \ detection, the detection of plants and weeds\nduring data collection, and the\
    \ stable remote control of the equipment [25]. Although\nthe ﬁeld phenotyping\
    \ applications of AI are in relative infancy compared to laboratory\nphenotyping,\
    \ their growth is notable because they provide the phenotypic data of plants in\n\
    their natural environment.\nIn addition to image analysis, AI applications that\
    \ are widely used in other domains\nof science are now being integrated into the\
    \ phenomics data management pipeline. Cy-\nberinfrastructure (CI), a research\
    \ environment that provides linkages between researchers,\ndata storage, and computing\
    \ systems using high-performance networks has been applied\nwidely in the environmental\
    \ sciences [26–28]. CI is now being applied to phenomics in\norder to facilitate\
    \ collaboration among researchers [29]. Open-source devices and tools\nrepresent\
    \ another fast developing application of AI technologies [30]. In phenomics, these\n\
    tools are addressing the challenges of expensive phenotyping equipment and proprietary\n\
    or incompatible data formats. The growth of these applications of AI has expanded\
    \ the\nﬁeld of phenomics with industry companies investing in the manufacture\
    \ and distribution\nof phenotyping technologies alongside government-funded agricultural\
    \ institutions.\nThis review begins by considering the broader area of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence and its inte-\ngration and application in phenomics through machine\
    \ learning and deep learning. Digital,\nﬂuorescence, spectroscopic, thermography,\
    \ and tomography imaging, and the integration\nof artiﬁcial intelligence into\
    \ their individual data management are highlighted. Thereafter,\nadditional applications\
    \ of AI such as cyberinfrastructure and open-source devices and tools\nare discussed.\
    \ The current utilization of phenotyping technologies for ﬁeld phenotyping,\n\
    which is increasingly gaining ground over phenotyping in controlled environments,\
    \ is then\ndiscussed brieﬂy, highlighting their cross applicability with artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence.\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n3 of 19\n2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is widely referred to as the simulation of human intelligence\n\
    in machines which are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.\
    \ It is\napplied when referring to machines that exhibit traits associated with\
    \ the human mind [31].\nThe recent emergence and growth of AI in academia has\
    \ presented an opportunity, as well\nas a threat, for various domains in the sciences.\
    \ Whereas some predict that the application\nof AI through robotics could lead\
    \ to technological unemployment, it has enabled science to\nextend into areas\
    \ previously unexplored and provided ease of execution, for example, in\nmedical\
    \ diagnostics [32].\nIn order to effectively program machines for desired tasks,\
    \ AI methods call for large\nrepositories of data. The algorithms used in AI methods\
    \ need large sets of data for train-\ning to facilitate decision support by enhancing\
    \ early detection and thereby improving\ndecision-making [33]. The data acquisition\
    \ process in non-destructive phenomics involves\nintegrating the data from instruments/sensors\
    \ (i.e., digital cameras and spectrometers),\nusually equipped with their individual,\
    \ proprietary communication protocols, into the AI\nalgorithms. The sensor outputs\
    \ often require conversion to compatible digital formats be-\nfore analysis [7].\
    \ Phenomic data management therefore involves three critical components\nwhere\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence is applied: algorithms and programs to convert the sensory\
    \ data\ninto phenotypic information; model development to understand the genotype–phenotype\n\
    relationships with environmental interactions; and the management of databases\
    \ to allow\nfor the sharing of information and resources [6]. The main aspects\
    \ of AI, machine learning,\ndeep learning, and computer vision have been applied\
    \ thus far to a recognizable extent in\nphenomics (illustrated in Figure 1). Other\
    \ areas of application are cyberinfrastructure and\nopen-source devices and tools,\
    \ which will subsequently be discussed in detail.\nSensors 2021, 21, x FOR PEER\

    \ when referring to machines that exhibit traits associated with the human \n\
    mind [31]. The recent emergence and growth of AI in academia has presented an\
    \ oppor-\ntunity, as well as a threat, for various domains in the sciences. Whereas\
    \ some predict that \nthe application of AI through robotics could lead to technological\
    \ unemployment, it has \nenabled science to extend into areas previously unexplored\
    \ and provided ease of execu-\ntion, for example, in medical diagnostics [32].\
    \ \nIn order to effectively program machines for desired tasks, AI methods call\
    \ for large \nrepositories of data. The algorithms used in AI methods need large\
    \ sets of data for training \nto facilitate decision support by enhancing early\
    \ detection and thereby improving deci-\nsion-making [33]. The data acquisition\
    \ process in non-destructive phenomics involves in-\ntegrating the data from instruments/sensors\
    \ (i.e., digital cameras and spectrometers), usu-\nally equipped with their individual,\
    \ proprietary communication protocols, into the AI al-\ngorithms. The sensor outputs\
    \ often require conversion to compatible digital formats be-\nfore analysis [7].\
    \ Phenomic data management therefore involves three critical components \nwhere\
    \ artificial intelligence is applied: algorithms and programs to convert the sensory\
    \ \ndata into phenotypic information; model development to understand the genotype–phe-\n\
    notype relationships with environmental interactions; and the management of databases\
    \ \nto allow for the sharing of information and resources [6]. The main aspects\
    \ of AI, machine \nlearning, deep learning, and computer vision have been applied\
    \ thus far to a recognizable \nextent in phenomics (illustrated in Figure 1).\
    \ Other areas of application are cyberinfra-\nstructure and open-source devices\
    \ and tools, which will subsequently be discussed in de-\ntail. \n \nFigure 1.\
    \ Workflow illustrating application of AI in phenomics. \n \n \nFigure 1. Workﬂow\
    \ illustrating application of AI in phenomics.\n2.1. Machine Learning\nSince the\
    \ 1970s, AI research has been focused on machine learning. Statistical ma-\nchine\
    \ learning frameworks and models such as Perceptron, support vector machines,\
    \ and\nBayesian networks have been designed. However, no single model works best\
    \ for all tasks.\nIt is still challenging to determine the best model for a given\
    \ problem [34]. According\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n4 of 19\nto Roscher et al.\
    \ 2020 [35], the rise and success of neural networks, coupled with the\nabundance\
    \ of data and high-level computational and data processing infrastructure, has\n\
    led to the comprehensive utilization of machine learning (ML) models and algorithms\n\
    despite the challenge of model determinations for a given task.\nThe utilization\
    \ of a range of imaging techniques for nondestructive phenotyping has\ninﬂuenced\
    \ the development of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), whereby multiple\nimaging\
    \ sensors collect plant data in near-real-time platforms. These sensors have the\n\
    capacity to collect large volumes of data which has, in turn, made phenomics a\
    \ big data\nproblem well suited for the application of ML. The analysis and interpretation\
    \ of these large\ndatasets are quite challenging, but ML algorithms provide an\
    \ approach for faster, efﬁcient,\nand better data analytics than traditional processing\
    \ methods. Traditional processing\nmethods include probability theory, decision\
    \ theory, optimization, and statistics. ML\ntools leverage these processing methods\
    \ to extract patterns and features from these large\namounts of data in order\
    \ to enable feature identiﬁcation in particular complex tasks such\nas stress\
    \ phenotyping [36].\nAccording to Rahaman et al. 2019 [37], one of the advantages\
    \ of using ML approaches\nin plant phenotyping is their ability to search large\
    \ datasets and discover patterns by\nsimultaneously looking at a combination of\
    \ features (compared to analyzing each feature\nseparately). This was previously\
    \ a challenge because of the high dimensionality of plant\nimages and their large\
    \ quantity, making them difﬁcult to analyze through traditional\nprocessing methods\
    \ [36]. Machine learning methods have thus far been successfully\napplied in the\
    \ identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant diseases [38,39] and plant organ\n\
    segmentation, among other tasks as shown in Table 1 below. This has been achieved\
    \ by\nsupervised learning, where the algorithms can identify diseased plants after\
    \ being trained\nwith sample images from large datasets. However, this approach\
    \ prevents the search for\nnovel and unexpected phenotypic traits that would otherwise\
    \ be discovered by the less\naccurate unsupervised ML [40].\nTable 1. Examples\

    \ is a rapidly advancing subset of machine learning tools that has created\na\
    \ paradigm shift in image-based plant phenotyping. It is efﬁcient in the discovery\
    \ of\ncomplex structures in high-dimensional data and is thus applicable to a\
    \ range of scientiﬁc\nresearch tasks [24]. The plant images collected using the\
    \ various sensors have a wide\nvariability, making the use of some machine learning\
    \ techniques challenging [47]. While\ntraditional machine learning involves trial-and-error\
    \ steps in the feature extraction process\nof images, deep learning tools have\
    \ enabled the creation of more reliable workﬂows for\nfeature identiﬁcation. They\
    \ employ an automatic hierarchical feature extraction process\nusing a large bank\
    \ of non-linear ﬁlters before carrying out decision-making, such as\nclassiﬁcation.\
    \ Deep learning approaches have multiple hidden layers in the network, with\n\
    each layer performing a simple operation on the images in succession which increases\
    \ their\ndiscrimination and prediction ability [48]. A wide range of deep learning\
    \ architectures has\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n5 of 19\nbeen used in plant phenotyping\
    \ by a process called transfer learning. This involves the use\nof a network that\
    \ was pre-trained on a large dataset somewhat similar to the one under\ninvestigation\
    \ and retraining it with weights for the new dataset. Table 2 details some deep\n\
    learning architectures that have been applied using transfer learning for phenotyping.\n\

    \ chal-\nlenges in their integration with agricultural applications. There is\
    \ still limited availability\nof publicly available annotated agricultural data,\
    \ which reduces the possibility of obtain-\ning high-performance feature extraction\
    \ models through transfer learning. In addition,\nmany agricultural image data\
    \ have high levels of occlusion (especially plant leaves and\nbackground noise),\
    \ leading to higher likelihoods of error from confusing objects of interest\n\
    with the background. This is partly due to the environmental variations (e.g.,\
    \ cloudy sky,\nwindy weather for ﬁeld data collection) that signiﬁcantly impact\
    \ the images and make\nthem harder to work with. Similarly, data samples are also\
    \ sensitive to imaging angles,\nﬁeld terrain and conditions, and variations within\
    \ plant genotypes. Hence, the robustness\nand adaptability requirements are signiﬁcantly\
    \ high for the deep learning models built for\nagricultural applications [55].\n\
    Thus far, deep learning architectures in phenotyping have been used in leaf count-\n\
    ing [56], the classiﬁcation of plant morphology [57], plant recognition and identiﬁcation\
    \ [55],\nroot and shoot feature identiﬁcation [48], and plant stress identiﬁcation\
    \ and classiﬁca-\ntion [58]. A few reported applications of machine learning or\
    \ deep learning for stress\nprediction and quantiﬁcation provide great opportunities\
    \ for new research efforts of plant\nscientists. A key challenge to overcome is\
    \ that the underlying processes for linking the\ninputs to the outputs are too\
    \ complex to model mathematically.\n3. Application of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in\
    \ Phenotyping Technologies\n3.1. Imaging Techniques\nTraditionally, the measurement\
    \ of observable plant traits has been conducted by\ndestructive sampling followed\
    \ by laboratory determinations to characterize phenotypes\nbased on their genetic\
    \ functions. Due to technological advancement in AI, imaging tech-\nniques (overview\
    \ in Table 3) have emerged as important tools for non-destructive sampling,\n\
    allowing image capture, data processing, and analysis to determine observable\
    \ plant traits.\nAccording to Houle et al. 2010 [5], “imaging is ideal for phenomic\
    \ studies because of the\navailability of many technologies that span molecular\
    \ to organismal spatial scales, the\nintensive nature of the characterization,\
    \ and the applicability of generic segmentation\ntechniques to data.” Spatial\
    \ or temporal data of many phenotype classes such as mor-\nphology and geometric\
    \ features, behavior, physiological state, and locations of proteins\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 4363\n6 of 19\nand metabolites can be captured in intensive detail\
    \ by imaging. For that reason, imaging\ntechniques have allowed for high-throughput\
    \ screening and real-time image analysis of\nphysiological changes in plant populations.\
    \ At the laboratory scale, the different imaging\nmethods are tested individually.\
    \ One, or a combination of the best-suited methods for crop\nsurveillance, are\
    \ then used both in controlled and ﬁeld environments [5,59].\nTable 3. Visualization\

    \ state that “computer\nvision aims to bring together factors derived from multiple\
    \ research areas such as image\nprocessing and statistical learning to simulate\
    \ human perception capability using the\npower of computational modeling of the\
    \ visual domain.” Computer vision uses machine\nlearning to recognize patterns\
    \ and extract information from the images. The computer\nvision workﬂow (shown\
    \ in Figure 2) carries out visual tasks ranging from pre-processing\n(e.g., conversion\
    \ of image formats, color space conversions etc.) to object detection applied\n\
    in ML algorithms, resulting in the comprehension of image understanding in a human-like\n\
    way [34]. Computer vision transforms the images so that they can be applied to\
    \ an AI\nsystem. This process has high computational demands, especially when\
    \ working with\nimages of varying formats from a range of sensors, as is the case\
    \ in phenotyping imaging\ntechniques [32]. A few of the different imaging techniques\
    \ are discussed below.\nSensors 2021, 21, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n7 of 19 \n \n \n\

    \ also provides information on the size and color of\nplants, which enables the\
    \ quantiﬁcation of plant deterioration arising from, for example,\nnutrient deﬁciencies\
    \ or pathogen infections, etc. Using a combination of careful image\ncapture,\
    \ image analysis, and color classiﬁcation, it is possible to follow the progression\
    \ of\nlesions from infections and deﬁciencies over time quantitatively [8].\n\
    Advances in hardware and software for digital image processing have motivated\
    \ the\ndevelopment of machine vision systems providing for the expeditious analysis\
    \ of RGB\nimages. Being relatively the simplest and most widely used technique\
    \ has served as an\nadvantage, as many machine learning techniques and deep learning\
    \ architecture can be\napplied effectively to RGB images. These techniques have\
    \ been applied in the identiﬁcation\nof plant growth stage [41], classiﬁcation\
    \ of plant images [43–46], disease detection and\nclassiﬁcation [38,52,53,65],\
    \ identiﬁcation of biotic and abiotic stress [49,58], weed detec-\ntion [50,51],\
    \ detection of ﬂowering times [57], and leaf counting [54–56]. Although the\n\
    extraction of useful phenotyping features from 2D digital images has been successful,\
    \ the\nexpansion in computer vision has led to an exploration of the applications\
    \ of 3D imaging.\nThis has been achieved using stereo-vision, where two identical\
    \ RGB cameras are used\nto capture images in a setup similar to the operation\
    \ of the human eyes. These images\nare then used to reconstruct a 3D model of\
    \ the plant for analysis using stereo-matching\nalgorithms [60,77]. Approaches\
    \ using multiple images from more than two RGB cameras\nplaced at different viewing\
    \ angles have been successfully used for larger plants with a\nhigher degree of\
    \ occlusion thereby expanding the applications of digital imaging [78].\n3.1.2.\
    \ Spectroscopy\nSpectroscopic imaging is a widely used imaging technique that\
    \ has been used to\npredict many properties of large plant populations [5]. It\
    \ consists of multispectral and\nhyperspectral imaging. In multispectral imaging,\
    \ the images are captured in wavelengths\nbetween visible and near-infrared, consisting\
    \ of up to ﬁfteen spectral bands, whereas in\nhyperspectral imaging, hundreds\
    \ of continuous spectral wavebands are available. Pre-\nvious phenotyping studies\
    \ have shown that spectroscopy can be used to monitor plant\nphotosynthetic pigment\
    \ composition, assess water status, and detect abiotic or biotic plant\nstresses\
    \ [79]. During plant development, varying growth conditions induce changes in\n\
    surface and internal leaf structure, modifying the reﬂection of light from plant\
    \ leaves or\ncanopies. These changes can be visualized by spectroscopy, either\
    \ in the visible spectrum\nor near-infrared wavelengths undetectable by the human\
    \ eye (0.7–1.3 mm) [18]. The appli-\ncation of spectroscopy is therefore important\
    \ for the ﬁeld monitoring of plant traits arising\nfrom gene expression in response\
    \ to environmental factors [20].\nHyperspectral imaging has thus far been successfully\
    \ applied in both controlled envi-\nronments (i.e., greenhouses and growth chambers)\
    \ and ﬁeld environments [80]. However,\na major limitation to the utility of hyperspectral\
    \ data in ﬁeld phenotyping, besides the\ncost of the equipment, is the variability\
    \ in environmental conditions during measurements.\nSpectrometers are highly sensitive\
    \ and rely on solar radiation as a light source in the ﬁeld,\nand this leads to\
    \ difﬁculty in the analysis of images due to cloud cover, shadows caused\nby phenotyping\
    \ platforms, and changes in solar angle during the photo period [8,80].\nAnother\
    \ challenge in hyperspectral data analysis is data redundancy due to the continuous\n\
    nature of wavelengths and their similarity. This has been alleviated by the selection\
    \ of\neffective wavelengths using algorithms such as the successive projections\
    \ algorithm (SPA),\ngenetic algorithm (GA), the Monte-Carlo uninformative variable\
    \ elimination (MC-UVE),\nand boosted regression tree (BRT) which is also a ML\
    \ technique [81–83].\nAlthough these difﬁculties can potentially be remedied by\
    \ applying robust com-\nputer vision algorithms, hyperspectral images have only\
    \ been successfully applied to\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n8 of 19\nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms and not to faster and more advanced deep learning algo-\nrithms.\
    \ Nonetheless, hyperspectral imaging allows for a wide variety of stresses to\
    \ be\ndetected and continues to be a promising way to detect speciﬁc signatures\
    \ for a particular\nstressor [18].\n3.1.3. Thermography\nThermography, also known\
    \ as thermal imaging, is a technique that detects infra-\nred radiation from an\
    \ object and creates an image based on it. Thermographic cameras\ndetect infrared\
    \ radiation (9000−14,000 nanometers) in the electromagnetic spectrum and\ncreate\
    \ images based off of it [84]. Thermography has been used in plant research to\n\
    monitor transpiration and canopy temperature. Transpiration is linked with nutrient\n\
    uptake by the roots and, ultimately, with crop productivity. However, it also\
    \ reﬂects\nwater use efﬁciency. Canopy temperature has been widely used to infer\
    \ crop water use,\nphotosynthesis, and, in some cases, to predict yield. In breeding\
    \ programs aimed at\nselecting plants based on water use efﬁciency, thermography\
    \ improves the speed and\neffectiveness of monitoring transpiration [18]. It has\
    \ also been used in the ﬁeld as a\nremote sensing tool to capture canopy temperature\
    \ data for a large number of plots using\nmicrobolometer-based thermal imaging\
    \ mounted on ﬁeld phenotyping platforms above the\ncrop using helium balloons\
    \ or manned aircraft [8]. Despite the inability of thermography to\ndetect pre-symptomatic\
    \ changes in leaves, it can detect changes in leaf thickness [18]. This\nallows\
    \ for the visualization and monitoring of internal structural heterogeneity resulting\n\
    from stresses or infections.\nIn phenotyping, thermography is used in combination\
    \ with other imaging techniques\nfor effective diagnostics [85]. Photogrammetry\
    \ algorithms such as structure-from-motion\nhave been applied to thermographic\
    \ images [86] collected in ﬁeld environments without\nmuch success. Currently,\
    \ the data collected from the images is analyzed using standard\nequations and\
    \ ML statistical methods such as probability theory, decision theory and\nclassiﬁers\
    \ [87]. Thermography has a range of applications from medical diagnostics to\n\
    metal defect detection in industries where deep learning algorithms have been\
    \ applied to\nthermal images [88].\n3.1.4. Fluorescence\nFluorescence imaging,\
    \ also known as ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, is used as a measure-\nment technique\
    \ for photosynthetic function under stresses such as drought and infections\n\
    by detecting light emitted after the plant has been exposed to a speciﬁc wavelength\
    \ of light.\nThese stresses have adverse effects that lead to a decrease in photosynthesis\
    \ which, in turn,\nlimits crop yield. Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging has enabled\
    \ the early visualization\nof viral and fungal infections due to its ability to\
    \ achieve high resolutions. It has also\nbeen used in studies to determine plant\
    \ leaf area [18]. For the rapid screening of plant\npopulations, portable ﬂuorometers\
    \ are being used to obtain average measurements of\nwhole plants or leaves at\
    \ the same developmental stage. There is potential for portable ﬂu-\norescence\
    \ imaging to be used for the ﬁeld-scale assessment of infections, even for those\
    \ that\nleave no visible trace [8,18,67]. Fluorescence imaging is usually used\
    \ in combination with\nhyperspectral imaging, and image data extracted using this\
    \ technique has been successfully\napplied to algorithms based on AI methods,\
    \ such as neural networks, for analysis [89].\n3.1.5. Tomography\nX-ray computed\
    \ tomography (X-ray CT) is a technology that uses computer-processed\nX-rays to\
    \ produce tomographic images of speciﬁc areas of scanned objects. It can generate\
    \ a\n3D image of the inside of an object from an extensive series of 2D radiographic\
    \ images taken\naround a single axis of rotation [76]. X-ray CT imaging technology\
    \ has been used for several\napplications in plant phenotyping. It has been applied\
    \ in the observation of root growth\nbecause of its ability to capture the intricacies\
    \ of the edaphic environment with high spatial\nresolutions [90,91]. X-ray CT\
    \ has also been used in the high-throughput measurement of\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 4363\n9 of 19\nrice tillers to determine grain yield. It was applied as the\
    \ preferred imaging technique for\nthe rice tiller study because of the tendency\
    \ of rice tillers to overlap and, hence, not be easily\ndetectable by digital\
    \ imaging [92]. According to Li et al. 2014 [76], however, “tomographic\nimaging\
    \ remains low throughput, and its image segmentation and reconstruction need to\
    \ be\nfurther improved to enable high throughput plant phenotyping.” Although\
    \ this technology\nis effective in the early detection of plant stress symptoms,\
    \ its effectiveness is further\nimproved by combined use with other imaging techniques.\
    \ The simultaneous use of CT and\npositron emission tomography (PET) has the potential\
    \ to be used to provide insight into the\neffect of abiotic stress in particular\
    \ [71,76]. Additionally, to provide satisfactory resolutions,\nX-ray CT requires\
    \ small pot sizes and controlled environments, making it unsuitable for\nﬁeld\
    \ applications. For morphological root phenotyping tasks, X-ray CT has been applied\
    \ in\nthe identiﬁcation of root tips and root-soil segmentation tasks using machine\
    \ learning [93].\nDespite the minimal use of tomography in phenotyping, its application\
    \ in the medical ﬁeld\npositions it as a powerful technique that, coupled with\
    \ AI algorithms (and particularly\nCNNs), is beneﬁcial in diagnostics [94].\n\
    3.2. Cyberinfrastructure\nCyberinfrastructure (CI) is described by Atkins et al.\
    \ 2003 [95] as a “research environ-\nment that supports advanced data acquisition,\
    \ storage, management, integration, mining,\nvisualization and other computing\
    \ and processing services distributed over the internet\nbeyond the scope of a\
    \ single institution.” It consists of computing systems, data storage\nsystems,\
    \ advanced instruments and data repositories, visualization environments, and\
    \ peo-\nple (shown in Figure 3) linked together by software and high-performance\
    \ networks [27].\nThis enhances the efﬁciency of research and productivity in\
    \ the use of resources. Some CI\nsystems can provide for in-ﬁeld data analysis\
    \ to point out errors in data collection that can\nbe rectiﬁed and identify further\

    \ to the various components required, CI systems are expensive, with\nthe cost\
    \ of a supercomputer alone being upwards of US$90 million. For this reason, some\n\
    organizations that can invest in this infrastructure offer it as a service at\
    \ a fee to researchers.\nFor example, the University of Illinois at Chicago provides\
    \ various cost models for access\nto their infrastructure [97].\nCI has been applied\
    \ in scientiﬁc disciplines ranging from biomedical to geospatial\nand environmental\
    \ sciences. One such project is the distributed CI called the Function\nBiomedical\
    \ Informatics Research Network (FBIRN), a large-scale project in the area of\n\
    biomedical research funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) [96].\
    \ CI has\nalso been applied in geospatial research with a range of initiatives\
    \ under the National\nSpatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The NSDI focuses on\
    \ spatial data collection from\ngovernment and private sources, integration and\
    \ sharing through its GeoPlatform (https:\n//www.geo-platform.gov/, accessed on\
    \ 26 June 2021) [98]. In the geospatial domain, one\nexample is the Data Observation\
    \ Network for Earth (DataONE), which is a CI platform for\nintegrative biological\
    \ and environmental research. It is designed to provide an underlying\ninfrastructure\
    \ that facilitates data preservation and re-use for research with an initial focus\n\
    on remote-sensed data for the biological and environmental sciences [99]. Because\
    \ of the\ncomplexities in developing and setting up a CI, Wang et al. 2013 [100]\
    \ put forward the\nCyberaide Creative service, which uses virtual machine technologies\
    \ to create a common\nplatform separate from the hardware and software and then\
    \ deploys a cyberinfrastructure\nfor its users. This allows for end-users to specify\
    \ the necessary resource requirements and\nhave them immediately deployed without\
    \ needing to understand their conﬁguration and\nbasic infrastructures.\nIn plant\
    \ phenotyping, a case for the use of CI has been made similarly in that non-\n\
    invasive high throughput phenotyping technologies collect large amounts of plant\
    \ data.\nAnalysis methods for this data using AI are being developed but face\
    \ the challenge of\nintegrating datasets and the poor scalability of these tools\
    \ [29]. The large amounts of data\ngenerated by HTP platforms need to be efﬁciently\
    \ archived and retrieved for analysis.\nResearchers afﬁliated with the United\
    \ States National Science Foundation (NSF) have\ndeveloped a form of CI called\
    \ iPlant that incorporates artiﬁcial intelligence technologies to\nstore and process\
    \ plant data gathered from the various HTP platforms. This CI platform\nprovides\
    \ tools for data analysis and storage with high-performance computing to access\n\
    and analyze the data. It also has methods for the integration of tools and datasets\
    \ [29].\nIn order to support both genotyping and phenotyping, iPlant uses the\
    \ BISQUE (Bio-\nImage Semantic Query User Environment) [101] software system.\
    \ Its main functionality is\nimage analysis which it supports using its ﬁve core\
    \ services: image storage and manage-\nment, metadata management and query, analysis\
    \ execution, and client presentation. Its\ndesign is ﬂexible enough to support\
    \ the range of variability in image analysis workﬂows\nbetween research labs.\
    \ The plant-oriented version of BISQUE, PhytoBISQUE, provides\nan application\
    \ programming interface integrated with iPlant to develop and deploy new\nalgorithms,\
    \ facilitating collaboration among researchers [29].\n3.3. Open-Source Devices\
    \ and Tools\nOpen-source is a term generally used to refer to tools or software\
    \ that, as stated by\nAksulu & Wade, 2010 [30], “allows for the modiﬁcation of\
    \ source code, is freely distributed,\nis technologically neutral, and grants\
    \ free subsidiary licensing rights.” Characteristically,\nOpen-Source Systems\
    \ (OSS) are voluntary and collaborative in nature and their lifespan\nlasts as\
    \ long as there is an individual willing and able to maintain the system [102].\
    \ Few\ntraditional operation constraints such as scope, time, and cost factors\
    \ affect these systems,\nand they have the added advantage of enhancing the skills\
    \ of the people involved while\nproducing tangible cost-effective technology output\
    \ [30]. Some OSS development teams\ntake advantage of crowdsourcing which widens\
    \ the scope and quality of ideas and reduces\nproject cycle time [103].\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 4363\n11 of 19\nIn phenomics, new crop management strategies require\
    \ the co-analyses of both sensor\ndata on crop status and related environmental\
    \ and genetic metadata. Unfortunately, this\ndata is mostly restricted to larger\
    \ well-funded agricultural institutions since the instruments\nfor data collection\
    \ are expensive. The available phenotyping instruments output data that is\nchallenging\
    \ to interpret because of proprietary or incompatible formats. Many techniques\n\
    that are being applied are ready-made off-the-shelf software packages that do\
    \ not have\nspeciﬁc algorithms for this data interpretation. Phenotyping researchers,\
    \ therefore, have to\naddress the challenges of data interpretation and data sharing\
    \ alongside limited access to\ninstrumentation (especially that which is well\
    \ suited for ﬁeld phenotyping). Open-source\ntools and devices represent a promising\
    \ approach for addressing these challenges. Those be-\ning applied in phenomics\
    \ are more accessible and easy to use while providing a connection\nto a community\
    \ of users with broader support and continuous improvement [104,105]. One\nsuch\
    \ open-source device is the MultispeQ device (PhotosynQ, East Lansing, MI, USA),\
    \ an\ninexpensive device linked through the PhotosynQ platform (https://www.photosynq.com,\n\
    accessed on 1 June 2021) to communities of researchers, providing useful data\
    \ on plant\nperformance. The MultispeQ device is rugged and ﬁeld deployable, open-source,\
    \ and\nexpandable to incorporate new sensors and techniques. The PhotosynQ platform\
    \ connects\nthe MultispeQ instrument to the community of researchers, breeders,\
    \ and citizen scientists\nto foster ﬁeld-based and community-driven phenotyping\
    \ [105].\nAn open-source prediction approach called Dirichlet-aggregation regression\
    \ (DAR)\nwas put forward by Bauckhage and Kersting, 2013 [104], to address the\
    \ challenge of manual\ndata labeling and running supervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ on hyperspectral data.\nHyperspectral cameras record a spectrum of several hundred\
    \ wave-lengths ranging from\napproximately 300 nm to 2500 nm, which poses a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge of data handling\nin hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, working\
    \ with hyperspectral data requires\nalgorithms and architecture that can cope\
    \ with massive amounts of data. Their research\nshows that DAR can predict the\
    \ level of drought stress of plants effectively and before it\nbecomes visible\
    \ to the human eye.\nOpen-source software and platforms have also been developed\
    \ that simplify the com-\nputer vision image management pipeline. One such tool\
    \ is the PlantCV image analysis\nsoftware package. It is used to build workﬂows\
    \ that can be used to extract data from images\nand sensors, and it employs various\
    \ computational tools in python that are extendable,\ndepending on the required\
    \ image analysis task, in order to provide data scientists and\nbiologists with\
    \ a common interface [106]. It deploys additional open-source tools such as\n\
    LabelImg for image annotation [107]. PlantCV’s image processing library has been\
    \ applied\nin Deep Plant Phenomics which is an open-source software platform that\
    \ implements deep\nconvolutional neural networks for plant phenotyping [108].\
    \ Deep Plant Phenomics pro-\nvides an image processing pipeline that has been\
    \ used for complex non-linear phenotyping\ntasks such as leaf counting, mutant\
    \ classiﬁcation, and age regression in Arabidopsis.\nAnother group of open-source\
    \ tools that have been applied in phenomics are the\nMobileNet deep learning architectures.\
    \ MobileNet architectures are convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) with reduced\
    \ complexity and model size and are suited to devices with\nlow computational\
    \ power such as mobile phones. MobileNets optimize for latency resulting\nfrom\
    \ low computing power by providing small networks with substantial accuracy that\n\
    can be used in real-world applications [109]. One example is the MobileNetV2 which\
    \ is\nbuilt to be used for classiﬁcation, detection, and segmentation of images.\
    \ It uses ReLU6\nnon-linearity, which is suited to low-precision computation [110].\
    \ These are promising for\nuse on mobile phones which are widely accessible and\
    \ commonplace to be potentially used\nfor ﬁeld phenotyping. MobileNets employ\
    \ TensorFlow Lite, an open-source deep learning\nframework used to deploy machine\
    \ learning models on mobile devices [111].\nLighting problems in outdoor settings\
    \ have the potential to affect open-source tools\nand the performance of CNNs.\
    \ There is, therefore, a need to test and train the networks\non plant images\
    \ collected in the ﬁeld. A mobile-based CNN model was used for plant\ndisease\
    \ diagnosis, and the problem of inconsistent light conditions was solved in this\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 4363\n12 of 19\nstudy [112] by the use of an umbrella. This\
    \ model was employed ofﬂine and displayed\ndecreased performance because of differing\
    \ training datasets from the data collected in\nthe ﬁeld and, therefore, highlighted\
    \ the need to capture more images using mobile devices\nin typical ﬁeld settings\
    \ and to use those very images for the training of the models in\norder to improve\
    \ the accuracy. In deploying open-source platforms and CNNs, there is an\nadditional\
    \ challenge in developing tools that can analyze and determine a wide variety\n\
    of phenotypes from various crops, and it has not been possible to develop a one-size-\n\
    ﬁts-all platform for analysis. However, various platforms are thus far available\
    \ for some\nphenotyping tasks.\n4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Field Phenotyping\n\
    In order to screen plants for valuable traits (such as grain size, abiotic stress\
    \ toler-\nance, product quality, or yield potential), experiments with repeated\
    \ trials are required\nin different environments based on the objectives of the\
    \ study. Much of the discussion of\nphenotyping has focused on the measurement\
    \ of individual plants in controlled environ-\nments. However, controlled environments\
    \ do not provide an accurate representation of\nplant growth in open-air conditions\
    \ [7]. Field-based phenotyping (FBP) is now increasingly\nwidely recognized as\
    \ the only approach that gives accurate depictions of the traits in\nactual cropping\
    \ systems. Currently, sensor systems suitable for high-throughput ﬁeld\nphenotyping\
    \ can simultaneously measure multiple plots and fuse a multitude of traits in\n\
    different data formats [17]. Through the use of vehicles carrying multiple sets\
    \ of sensors,\nFBP platforms are transforming the characterization of plant populations\
    \ for genetic re-\nsearch and crop improvement. Accomplishing FBP in a timely\
    \ and cost-effective manner\nhas led to the use of unmanned aircraft, wheeled\
    \ vehicles, or agricultural robots to deploy\nmultiple sensors that can measure\
    \ plant traits in brief time intervals [7]. Therefore, pheno-\ntyping in many\
    \ crop breeding programs is now being conducted by combining instruments\nwith\
    \ novel technologies such as non-invasive imaging, robotics, and high-performance\n\
    computing on the FBP platforms [8].\nUnmanned aircraft are particularly attractive\
    \ for data acquisition because they enable\nsensing with a high spatial and spectral\
    \ resolution for a relatively low cost. Unmanned\nhelicopters (such as the one\
    \ shown in Figure 4) can carry various sensors and have the ac-\ncommodation to\
    \ carry larger sensors. In windy conditions, helicopters enable precise ﬂight\n\
    control and operations in cluttered environments because of their maneuverability\
    \ and\nability to ﬂy at low speeds. Replicated collection of sensor data can be\
    \ achieved through au-\ntomatic ﬂight control when the helicopter is equipped\
    \ with algorithms for ground detection,\nobstacle detection and avoidance, and\
    \ stable effective control [113]. Modern unmanned\naerial systems (UAS) are better\
    \ equipped to manage the harsh environmental conditions\nand obstacles due to\
    \ rapid advances in technology such as collision technology, optical\nsensors\
    \ for machine vision, GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses. However,\n\
    they still face the challenge of limited battery power, with electric batteries\

    \ of 19\nAlthough not commonly used for phenotyping, wheeled vehicles are sometimes\
    \ used\nin phenotyping systems for some research projects since they also provide\
    \ for proximal\nphenotyping. They have the advantage of being able to cover large\
    \ areas and operate for\nlonger periods, along with the disadvantage of compacting\
    \ and damaging the soil and\nbeing costly because of the human labor required\
    \ to operate the vehicle. According to\nWhite et al. 2012 [7], high-clearance\
    \ tractors were expected to play a more central role in\nFBP as the wheeled vehicles\
    \ of choice due to their high vertical clearance, availability, and\nease of use.\
    \ They can be used for continuous measurements at different stages of the crop\n\
    growth process and can operate for longer periods compared to the UAVs. A variation\
    \ of\nhigh clearance tractors in the form of mobile motorized platforms, which\
    \ eliminate the\nneed for human labor in the ﬁeld, have been developed and tested\
    \ in various phenotyping\napplications [114,115].\nPhenotyping data collected\
    \ using these FBP systems faces the challenge of instability\nduring motion and\
    \ weather changes, which cause occlusion and mal-alignment in the\nimages. This\
    \ is partially addressed by using proximal sensing at slower speeds in order to\n\
    improve image resolution (although this limits the areal coverage in one ﬂight\
    \ and does\nnot fully solve the misalignment). Data processing for this data has\
    \ signiﬁcantly improved\nin recent years with AI-enabled snapshot and line scanning\
    \ imaging software, optimized\nspeciﬁcally for unmanned aircraft such as structure-from-motion\
    \ photogrammetry [87,116].\nOne approach that has been proposed to enhance the\
    \ application of these platforms for\nsensing in ﬁeld conditions is adapting ﬁeld\
    \ conditions to align with the HTP ﬁeld tech-\nniques (rather than the traditional\
    \ approach of adapting the instruments for the ﬁeld),\ndepending on the crop of\
    \ interest without compromising the realistic crop evaluation in\nﬁeld conditions\
    \ [6].\n5. Phenotyping Communities and Facilities\nThe growth in plant phenotyping\
    \ research coupled with the integration of AI tech-\nnology has fostered the development\
    \ of laboratories and centers equipped with high-\nthroughput phenotyping technologies.\
    \ Some of these plant phenotyping centers are\nmembers of the International Plant\
    \ Phenotyping Network (IPPN), which works with\nvarious member organizations in\
    \ academia and industry to distribute relevant information\nabout plant phenotyping\
    \ and increase its visibility [117]. Partner facilities such as the\nAustralian\
    \ Plant Phenomics Facility, a government-funded national facility, provide access\n\
    to infrastructure such as glass-house automation technologies, digital imaging\
    \ technologies,\nlong-term data storage, etc. [118]. Such facilities have and\
    \ continue to provide subsidized\naccess to advanced AI-phenotyping technologies\
    \ that would otherwise be inaccessible due\nto the costs of operation and maintenance.\
    \ In addition, as high-throughput phenotyping\nbecoming more common, there has\
    \ come the issue of data-merging with many laboratories\ngathering phenotypic\
    \ data that rarely enter the public domain where it could be accessed\nby other\
    \ institutions to foster interdisciplinary research [8]. Networks such as the\
    \ IPPN\ncontinue to provide access to phenotyping information generated by member\
    \ organiza-\ntions which is key in enabling cooperation between the organizations\
    \ and advancing the\nphenomics agenda through collaborative research.\nBesides\
    \ the academic institutions and government organizations, private industry\ncompanies\
    \ (a few of which have been highlighted here) are establishing themselves as\n\
    key providers and facilitators of plant phenotyping AI technology around the world.\
    \ Bio-\npute technology provides high-end research instruments such as multispectral\
    \ cameras\nfor ﬁeld phenotyping, drones for aerial photography, and provides after-sales\
    \ support\nservices to their customers. In partnership with universities and research\
    \ institutes, Bio-\npute provides innovations that are contributing to the progress\
    \ of plant phenotyping\nin China (http://www.bjbiopute.cn, accessed on 1 June\
    \ 2021). KeyGene is an agricul-\ntural biotechnology company providing tools for\
    \ precision breeding and digital pheno-\ntyping investing in deep learning-based\

    \ including root system phenotyping. They have also in-\ncorporated machine learning\
    \ to integrate robotics into the systems they develop to better\nautomate the\
    \ processes (https://psi.cz, accessed 1 June 2021).\n6. Conclusions\nRecent advancements\
    \ in high-throughput phenotyping technologies have led to signif-\nicant strides\
    \ in plant phenomics. The on-going integration of artiﬁcial intelligence into\
    \ these\ntechnologies promises progression into smarter and much faster technologies\
    \ with signiﬁ-\ncantly lower input costs. In the area of phenotyping image data\
    \ analysis, the integration\nof AI into the data management pipeline of tomography\
    \ and thermography is on a lower\nscale in comparison to the other imaging techniques.\
    \ The application of deep learning in\nthe data analysis of these techniques is\
    \ promising, as it has been successfully implemented\nin analysis of composite\
    \ materials [88] and medical diagnostics [94]. As much as ﬁeld\nphenotyping is\
    \ the most effective way to collect phenotypic data, it is still being conducted\n\
    on a relatively lower scale than is possible. Artiﬁcial intelligence technologies\
    \ also require\nlarge amounts of data from various sources to improve their accuracy.\
    \ This provides an\nopportunity to invest more into the tailoring of current technologies\
    \ for ﬁeld data collection\nand the utilization of already existing AI adaptable\
    \ technologies, such as smartphones, to\nincrease the quantity of quality data.\
    \ Smartphones have become widespread consumer\nproducts, and the simplicity and\
    \ ease of use of their sensors suggest that their use can be\nexplored in agriculture\
    \ [104]. Some of the challenges that would need to be addressed are\nthat advanced\
    \ signal processing on smartphones has to cope with constraints such as low\n\
    battery life, restricted computational power, or limited bandwidth [104]. The\
    \ use of citizen\nscience alongside professional researchers [119] in data collection\
    \ also has the potential\nto aid in increasing the amount of data collected. The\
    \ overall goal of employing these\napproaches and technologies is to provide the\
    \ infrastructure that allows for tracking how\nplant traits progress throughout\
    \ the growing season and facilitate the coordination of data\nanalysis, management,\
    \ and utilization of results using AI methods.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\
    \ connected to the platform.\nKeywords: IoT platform; data model; smart agriculture;\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\
    \ protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent\
    \ and can be\nintegrated to work with all vital technological systems;\n2.\nInteroperable:\
    \ The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection\
    \ with\ndevices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine\
    \ to Machine (LWM2M)\nover Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight\n(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility\
    \ of using parameterizing agents to integrate any\nother type of future protocols.\
    \ At the application level, the platform is open to integration with\nother third-party\
    \ platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 1153\n3 of 20\n3.\nSemantic enrichment: The use of the data model to homogenize\
    \ the management of the different\nelements that are part of a farm;\n4.\nEfﬁciency\
    \ and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made\
    \ in terms\nof management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically\
    \ document the health\nstatus of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient\
    \ and effective diagnosis technique\nfor managers.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to analyze the\nentire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions,\
    \ the PLANTAE platform [20] is a\nsystem capable of managing the agricultural\
    \ process and simultaneously using machine-learning\ntechniques to detect possible\
    \ diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],\nmonitored\
    \ the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile\n\
    applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;\n\
    •\nEfﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress.\
    \ Riquelme\net al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE\
    \ platform allows for the\nimprovement of the management of water used for irrigation\
    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\
    \ methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation\nwater,\
    \ using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the\
    \ SPARQL\nProtocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n5 of 20\n•\nImprovement in greenhouse management: By monitoring\
    \ its different components, Zamora-\nIzquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible\
    \ platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic\ncrops in a greenhouse with\
    \ complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message\nQueuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\
    \ to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor\
    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\
    \ for the prediction of the growth\nrate of tomatoes in different environments.\n\
    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\
    \ data acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated\ninto the platform and the associated\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ and Validation\nThis section describes the validation of the platform in a community\
    \ of irrigators from three\ndifferent perspectives. The tests were conducted under\
    \ a controlled environment with the equipment\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\
    \ based on remote sensors. This new\nattribute will focus on the diagnosis, management,\
    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    \ that are \nvery important to humanity and generate a considerable portion of\
    \ any \nnation's GDP. For good agricultural and farming management, technological\
    \ \nadvancements and support are required. Smart agriculture (or) farming is a\
    \ \nset of approaches that uses a variety of current information and \ncommunication\
    \ technology to improve the production and quality of \nagricultural products\
    \ with minimum human involvement and at a lower cost. \nSmart farming is mostly\
    \ based on IoT technology, since there is a need to \ncontinually monitor numerous\
    \ aspects in the agricultural field, such as water \nlevel, light, soil characteristics,\
    \ plant development, and so on. Machine \nlearning algorithms are used in smart\
    \ farming to increase production and \nreduce the risk of crop damage. Data analytics\
    \ has been shown through \nextensive study to improve the accuracy and predictability\
    \ of smart \nagricultural systems. Data analytics is utilised in agricultural\
    \ fields to make \ndecisions and recommend acceptable crops for production. This\
    \ study \nprovides a comprehensive overview of the different methods and structures\
    \ \nutilised in smart farming. It also provides a thorough analysis of different\
    \ \ndesigns and recommends appropriate answers to today's smart farming \nproblems.\

    \ 80% of the world's population. Random mobile \ncontact, spot messaging, mobile\
    \ phone calls, immersive two-way video chat, voice-over-internet-protocol \n(VoIP),\
    \ social networking, and ecommerce websites are all examples of how technology\
    \ has influenced \nmodern living. The internet of things (IoT) is the future web\
    \ platform for environmental and technological \ncommunication. The IoT is a cost-effective\
    \ and secure technology that may be used to upgrade a variety of \ndomains. IoT-based\
    \ solutions are being developed to autonomously monitor and track farms with minimum\
    \ \nhuman interaction. The IoT is a technical advancement that allows smart gadgets\
    \ and machines to \ncommunicate with one another while reducing human involvement.\

    ISSN:2302-9285 \n \n \nA comprehensive analysis on IoT based smart farming solutions\
    \ using machine … (Ahamed Ali Samsu Aliar) \n1551 \nagricultural human resources\
    \ are dwindling, and farmland is shrinking as a result of urbanisation. As a result,\
    \ \nmany agricultural operations will need to be simplified in order to fulfil\
    \ rising food demand. \nSmart farming has recently piqued the interest of many\
    \ academics, since it may assist farmers in \nmaking dynamic farm and crop management\
    \ decisions. The quality of agricultural goods and the lives of \nfarmers may\
    \ be considerably improved with the adoption of different new technologies in\
    \ the information \nand communication industry. Smart farming technology is employed\
    \ by approximately 80 percent of farmers \nin the United States, and about 24\
    \ percent of farmers in Europe. Intelligent farming enables farmers to \nimprove,\
    \ automate, and optimise conventional farming practises, resulting in improved\
    \ agricultural \nproductivity and a simpler cultivation system. Various IoT sensors\
    \ are used in intelligent farming, and these \nsensors are connected with agricultural\
    \ equipment, resulting in a synergistic rise in crop output and \nproductive agriculture\
    \ experiences. \nThe basic components which are essentially needed for smart farming\
    \ are: i) sensors: to provide \nvital information regarding various farm parameters\
    \ (soil moisture, water level, and fertilizer level) to do \nprecise farming;\
    \ ii) connectivity: cellular (3G/4G/5G), ZigBee, WiFi; iii) gateway: microcontrollers;\
    \ iv) \nlocation: GPS; v) data analytics:R, Pandas; vi) IoT components: DeviceHive,\
    \ Arduino, Raspberry PI. A \ntypical smart farming is a four stage process as\
    \ illustrated in Figure 1. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Basic smart farming architecture\
    \ \n \n \nSensors are used to determine numerous agricultural factors that are\
    \ required for a given crop, such \nas soil type, moisture level, nutrient presence,\
    \ and so on. The readings collected from the sensors are mapped \nwith certain\
    \ criteria in order to identify the agricultural product's unique demands or inadequacies.\
    \ To make \nintelligent judgments, machine learning algorithms are applied, and\
    \ it gives a good agricultural solution. The \nsmart farming cycle continues as\
    \ a result of the reaction. The specifics of several kinds of sensors used in\
    \ \nsmart farming are shown in Table 1 (in appendix). \n \n \n2. \nSMART FARMING\
    \ SOLUTIONS BASED ON IOT AND MACHINE LEARNING \nAPPROACHES \nRezk et al. [1] developed\
    \ “An efficient IoT based smart farming system employing machine \nlearning algorithms,”\
    \ a novel IoT-based smart farming technology. To increase crop production, they\
    \ used a \nsystem dubbed WPART, which is based on a wrapper feature selection\
    \ approach. In their method, they've \nincluded a powerful decision-making tool\
    \ called PART. The outputs of the PART algorithm do not need any \nglobal optimization.\
    \ The wrapper algorithm is used to improve the performance of the classifier.\
    \ Their \ntechnique has a flaw in that it just looks at time series data and does\
    \ not forecast future values. The model \nobtained 92.51% accurate results. \n\
    Vincent et al. [2] developed an expert methodology for using sensor networks to\
    \ assess agricultural \nland suitability. The agricultural dataset was created\
    \ using a variety of IoT sensors, including pH sensors, soil \nmoisture sensors,\
    \ salinity sensors, and electromagnetic sensors. Their assessment and analysis\
    \ method is \nbased on the multi-layer-perceptron (MLP). The cloud platform was\
    \ used to store the data collected from the \ndifferent IoT devices. The network\
    \ architecture, weight correction, and activation properties all play a role in\
    \ \nthe effectiveness of this study model. \nVarghese and Sharma [3] demonstrated\
    \ a simple and economical IoT system for monitoring diverse \ncrops under real-time\
    \ conditions. In order to construct a low-cost intelligent agricultural module,\
    \ they \ncombined IoT and machine learning technologies. All of the agricultural\
    \ data sets that are monitored have \n \n \n \nISSN:2302-9285 \nBulletin of Electr\
    \ Eng & Inf, Vol. 11, No. 3, June 2022: 1550-1557 \n1552 \nbeen moved to the cloud\
    \ (Amazon AWS). The generated dataset is trained using logistic regression (LR)\
    \ and \nsupport vector machine (SVM), which are useful for forecasting future\
    \ crop conditions based on historical \ndata. Anand et al. [4] created a novel\
    \ model that analyses soil quality and forecasts the optimum crop type \nsuited\
    \ for cultivation in that soil. The node MCU ESP8266 microcontroller is used in\
    \ their technique. The \nkey soil data were aggregated using three primary sensors:\
    \ a temperature sensor, a rain sensor, and a \nhumidity sensor to examine its\
    \ fertility and quality. The technique for obtaining environmental data was also\
    \ \ndescribed in their model. This information may be used to anticipate environmental\
    \ conditions and aid \nfarmers in making decisions. As a storage server, an open\
    \ cloud server (ThingSpeak) is employed. A hybrid \ntechnique, which combines\
    \ multiple linear regression (MLR) and K-Means clustering, is used to forecast\
    \ the \ncrop suited for cultivation in that soil. \nReddy et al. [5] proposed\
    \ an unique smart irrigation system. To anticipate a crop's water \nconsumption,\
    \ they used a decision tree paired with several regression and classification\
    \ techniques algorithm. \nMultiple agricultural sensors were used to create their\
    \ model, which can monitor temperature, wetness, and \nhumidity. The information\
    \ acquired by the system is sent to a cloud-based IoT system. The Raspberry Pi\
    \ and \nthe DHT11 soil moisture sensor are used in their model. Truong et al.\
    \ [6] built an IoT framework that \nincludes sensors, an LTE HUA8372 Wi-Fi internet\
    \ module, and a microcontroller. Their model can collect \nenvironmental data\
    \ in real time and send it to a cloud storage service. The support-vector-machine-regression\
    \ \n(SVMr) technique is used to detect fungal infections in a range of environments.\
    \ They've also devised a \nmethod for predicting and spreading severe fungal diseases.\
    \ SVMr is a popular tool for delivering intelligent \nsolutions. \nBy monitoring\
    \ soil moisture, soil temperature, and climatic variables, Goap et al. [7] established\
    \ an \nopen-source technique for identifying field-based irrigation needs using\
    \ soil characteristics. The approach \nuses support vector regression (SVR) and\
    \ k-means clustering to estimate soil moisture differences (SMD) \nduring rapid\
    \ changes in meteorological conditions. This method provides more accuracy while\
    \ reducing \nmean square errors (MSE). When compared to the SVR technique, this\
    \ new algorithm gives better accuracy \n(R=96%) and lower MSE in ground moisture\
    \ prediction. The hybrid learning approach for SVR+K-Means is \nutilised for irrigation\
    \ planning since it has a greater accuracy and lower MSE. On the basis of agronomic\
    \ \nknowledge, Goldstein et al. [8] developed cultivation recommendations. Gradient\
    \ boosted regression trees \n(GBRT) was shown to be the best regression model\
    \ solution for smart irrigation advice, with a precision of \n93%. The agronomist\
    \ may utilise the designed setup to regulate irrigation. \nRoopaei et al. [9]\
    \ suggested an intelligent monitoring method based on thermal imaging. Their study\
    \ \nrecommended using a thermal imaging sensor placed on a drone. The pictures\
    \ generated by the imaging \nsensor are utilised to analyse crucial irrigation\
    \ characteristics including as water demand, leaf quality, and \nfertiliser requirements.\
    \ Acar et al. [10] used an extreme learning machine (ELM) based on a regression\
    \ \nmodel to forecast soil moisture on the surface. The information gathered there\
    \ is utilised to predict soil \nmoisture content. Validation is carried by using\
    \ a brand-new approach known as the “leave-one-out” cross \nendorsement method.\
    \ The sine kernel function was used to assess the experimental setup, and the\
    \ root-mean-\nsquare-error (RMSE) was discovered to be about 2.19 percent. \n\
    Wang et al. [11] suggested a method for analysing soil nutrient concentration\
    \ in order to improve \nirrigation efficiency. They employed soft sensors based\
    \ on ELM to calculate the generation of nutrient \nsolutions. In the production\
    \ of nutrient solutions, the method effectively tracks pH values, temperatures,\
    \ and \nconcentration fluctuations. Park et al. [12] forecasted soil moisture\
    \ using soil moisture algorithms and \nMODIS data. The authors lowered the moisture\
    \ level by using Random-Forest (RF) and cubist methods. An \nensemble of these\
    \ methods is used to acquire soil humidity data. The findings of their technique\
    \ were \ncompared to those of the least-squares method. Using machine learning\
    \ techniques, Reda et al. [13] \nexamined several approaches to assess soil organic\
    \ carbon (SOC) and total-nitrogen (TN). To carry out their \nresearch, they took\
    \ soil samples from four agricultural areas in the African nation of Morocco.\
    \ Instead of \nemploying traditional chemical soil analysis procedures, they used\
    \ near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to \ngather data for their study. This method\
    \ reduces the amount of time and other computing overheads. This \nmethod uses\
    \ the ensemble learning modelling (ELM) technique to predict SOC and TN. \nMorellos\
    \ et al. [14] employed visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to assess\
    \ total nitrogen \n(TN), soil carbon, and humidity levels in an agricultural field.\
    \ The spectroscopic dataset is used to estimate \nthe three soil characteristics\
    \ listed above. The predicted machine learning models are then built using these\
    \ \ndatasets. For the analysis, least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs)\
    \ and Cubist approaches were \napplied. Their findings demonstrated that the LS-SVM\
    \ strategy is superior to linear-multivariate approaches \nfor estimating soil\
    \ parameters. Machine learning techniques were investigated by Mahmoudzadeh et\
    \ al. [15] \nto estimate and forecast soil carbon concentration. They discovered\
    \ that, in addition to SVM, KNN, Cubist, \nand extreme-gradient-boosting (XGBoost),\
    \ RF accurately predictions SOC with R2 of 0.60 and RMSE of \n0.30% on simulated\
    \ data. SOC is influenced by air temperature, yearly rainfall, valley depth, and\

    \ approximately 800 million people (one out \nof every nine people) worldwide\
    \ are hungry as a result of food shortages and poverty. Aside from this issue,\
    \ \nthe rapid growth in human population is another key element that contributes\
    \ to food scarcity. Food scarcity \nis exacerbated by issues such as global warming,\
    \ groundwater depletion, a lack of manpower in agriculture, \npollution, and the\
    \ shrinkage of agricultural area due to urbanisation and industrialisation. The\
    \ necessity of \nproducing and storing high-quality agricultural goods is highlighted\
    \ by the aforementioned difficulties. These \nissues also point to the necessity\
    \ for technical advancements in agriculture and farming. Smart farming has \n\
    recently emerged as a viable method for producing high-quality agricultural products\
    \ with low waste and \nhuman involvement. Machine learning, data analytics, cloud\
    \ computing, and agricultural robotics are all \nexamples of smart farming technology.\
    \ These technologies help farmers from sowing to harvesting high-\nquality crops.\
    \ This study provided a comprehensive overview of several smart farming architectures\
    \ and \nalgorithms. It has also emphasised the need of new technology in making\
    \ farming smarter in order to fulfil \nfuture food demand and other demands. This\
    \ report also concludes that additional research is required to \nmake farming\
    \ smarter in order to give high-quality food items to all living species, not\
    \ just humans. \n \n \n \n \n \nISSN:2302-9285 \nBulletin of Electr Eng & Inf,\

    27 Issue: 4, 373 - 399, 04.12.2021 Mehmet Ali DAYIOĞLU Ufuk TURKER https://doi.org/10.15832/ankutbd.986431
    Cited By: 16 Abstract In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects
    food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many
    global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change,
    and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available
    for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections
    between food-water-energy- climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation
    from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions
    in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital
    transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition
    from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial
    revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision
    agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application
    examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial
    intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time
    monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based
    irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation
    processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and
    greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones
    and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.
    Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies
    such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in
    rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and
    environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological
    innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect
    the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help
    us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental
    challenges. Keywords Smart Farming, Digital transformation, Sustainable development,

    \ new technologies in the precision agriculture domain with\nits intelligent algorithms\
    \ and strong computation. Oil palm is one of the rich crops that is also\nemerging\
    \ with modern technologies to meet global sustainability standards. This article\
    \ presents a\ncomprehensive review of research dedicated to the application of\
    \ ML in the oil palm agricultural\nindustry over the last decade (2011–2020).\
    \ A systematic review was structured to answer seven\npredeﬁned research questions\
    \ by analysing 61 papers after applying exclusion criteria. The works\nanalysed\
    \ were categorized into two main groups: (1) regression analysis used to predict\
    \ fruit\nyield, harvest time, oil yield, and seasonal impacts and (2) classiﬁcation\
    \ techniques to classify trees,\nfruit, disease levels, canopy, and land. Based\
    \ on deﬁned research questions, investigation of the\nreviewed literature included\
    \ yearly distribution and geographical distribution of articles, highly\nadopted\
    \ algorithms, input data, used features, and model performance evaluation criteria.\
    \ Detailed\nquantitative–qualitative investigations have revealed that ML is still\
    \ underutilised for predictive\nanalysis of oil palm. However, smart systems integrated\
    \ with machine vision and artiﬁcial intelligence\nare evolving to reform oil palm\
    \ agri-business. This article offers an opportunity to understand the\nsigniﬁcance\
    \ of ML in the oil palm agricultural industry and provides a roadmap for future\
    \ research\nin this domain.\nKeywords: oil palm; machine learning; systematic\
    \ review; agriculture; sustainability\n1. Introduction\nPalm oil is a key source\
    \ of edible vegetable oil extracted from fruits of the oil palm\ntree. It has\
    \ emerged as an important feedstock and biofuel raw material [1,2]. Cultivated\n\
    on millions of hectares in the world, oil palm has a noticeable part of the volume\
    \ of world\ntrade. The oil palm started its journey from West Africa and has become\
    \ a hope for the\neconomy of many countries. However, Southeast Asia is considered\
    \ the hub of the palm\noil industry, with Indonesia and Malaysia being the major\
    \ exporters [3]. The growing\ndemand for the palm oil threatens the future of\
    \ the rain forests because expanding oil\npalm cultivations tend to replace existing\
    \ forestry. To overcome the negative impacts of\noil palm farming by making it\
    \ a key element of building a future sustainable world, plant\nscience faces three\
    \ major challenges. The global average palm oil yield of 3.5 tons per\nhectare\
    \ should be elevated to the full yield potential around 11–18 t. The tree architecture\n\
    must be changed to low labour intensity and high mechanization of the harvest.\
    \ Oil\ncomposition should be tailored to the evolving demands of oleochemical,\
    \ fuel industries,\nand, most importantly, food [4]. Thus the use of technology\
    \ is inevitable to deal with\nthese challenges through the sustainable intensiﬁcation\
    \ of oil palm [5]. The application of\npowerful, intelligent ML methods has the\
    \ potential to transform the current productive\nagriculture into sustainable\
    \ agriculture. In precision agriculture, complex tasks such\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 832. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11090832\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 832\n2 of 26\nas land classiﬁcation, soil management, crop\
    \ selection, seasonal variations, fertilizers\nmanagement, crop yield forecasting,\
    \ and yield gap analysis are effectively evolving with\nML methods [6–9]. Because\
    \ of incredible learning and high computational power, ML\napproaches have also\
    \ been adopted in the ﬁeld of oil palm for the mechanization of several\ntasks\
    \ such as tree counting and plant health assessment [10,11]. However, the broader\n\
    inspiration of modern agriculture is to examine all factors that cause gaps in\
    \ crop yield.\nAgricultural productivity is subject to several stressors, including\
    \ biotic and abiotic risk\nfactors, many of which are intensiﬁed by a changing\
    \ climate, thereby affecting durable\nsustainability. The productivity of tree\
    \ crops such as oil palm is particularly complex.\nTo comprehend and mitigate\
    \ these risk factors, a collection of multi-layered large data\nsets is required.\
    \ Additionally, advanced analytics is also critical to integrate those highly\n\
    heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields\
    \ at tree\nand ﬁeld scales. Since yield gap analysis deals with interdependent\
    \ and irregular elements,\nit becomes difﬁcult to map their dependencies with\
    \ conventional methods. Thus, ML\napplication is an efﬁcient way to obtain precise\
    \ outcomes and appropriate solutions for\nsuch convoluted problems. Previously,\
    \ micro-components analysis was performed to study\nthe overall yield gap by the\
    \ commonly used “divide and conquer” ML strategy [12,13].\nThe studies concluded\
    \ that the investigation of individual yield-reducing factors could\nprovide insight\
    \ into the overall impact. On the other hand, ML application to evaluate\nthe\
    \ correlation among different factors such as soil moisture and rainfall, day\
    \ length and\nsolar radiation, fertilization frequency, and plant growth provides\
    \ better quantitative\nunderstandings [14–16]. The aforesaid statement necessitates\
    \ bringing such research\ndirections to light. In this regard, a domain-based\
    \ scientiﬁcally structured review article\ncan provide insightful information\
    \ to new researchers based on compiled results. It enables\ndepicting the state-of-the-art,\
    \ highlighting the strategic matters raised by the scientiﬁc\ncommunity and cluster\
    \ analysis [17]. Researchers can identify research gaps with reference\nto discussed\
    \ systems, concepts, and propositions. The review also helps to build a research\n\
    roadmap with knowledge of formerly applied theories and existing techniques [18].\n\
    In the literature, some authors have reviewed the application of effective tools\
    \ and\nML techniques in oil palm. For instance, Chong et al. conducted a review\
    \ on applications\nand practices of remote sensing for oil palm plantations monitoring\
    \ [19]. Accordingly,\nthe technologies developed for the processing of fruit and\
    \ palm oil waste management\nby converting it to biofuel are reviewed in [20].\
    \ The application of ML for detecting\nnutrition deﬁcits in oil palm with the\
    \ help of proximal images are explored in [21]. Besides,\nthe technical review\
    \ of sensors and techniques for oil palm plants’ disease detection is\nperformed\
    \ in [22]. Subsequently, ML features are reviewed for automatic fruit grading\n\
    with the help of image processing [23]. Recently, Rashid et al. reviewed ML application\
    \ for\nyield prediction of different crops, including oil palm [24]. From the\
    \ reviewed literature, it\nis observed that present studies did not systematically\
    \ search the literature in most cases.\nMoreover, only speciﬁc aspects (such as\
    \ yield prediction, crop monitoring, and nutrient\ndeﬁcits, etc.) of oil palm\
    \ using ML are reviewed. Although the cited works provide deep\ninsight into existing\
    \ studies, to date, unidimensional reviews lack a full presentation of\nthe overall\
    \ ML-based research in the oil palm domain. The literature search reveals that\
    \ a\nbroader overview of the current research trends and the extent of ML application\
    \ for oil\npalm is missing.\nIn need of a comprehensive analysis, this review\
    \ article brings together the application\nof ML in the oil palm agricultural\
    \ industry. To the best knowledge of the authors, there is\nno detailed review\
    \ until now that has explored multiple aspects of the oil palm domain\nwithin\
    \ the framework of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). The present state-of-the-art review\n\
    synthesizes all prominent studies published throughout an entire decade (2011–2020)\n\
    concerning oil palm in the ML context. It stands out from other review studies\
    \ as the\nliterature search was performed through a systematic protocol to ensure\
    \ unbiased data\nbase retrieval. Moreover, the standard protocol was extended\
    \ to perform qualitative\nand quantitative assessment of the searched literature.\
    \ This technique allows detailed\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n3 of 26\nand impartial\
    \ insight into contemporary studies in the domain. The goal of writing this\n\
    review was to analyse major progress, current trends, research gaps, and pioneering\n\
    concepts intended for stimulating research on oil palm with the application of\
    \ modern\ntechniques. This research was envisaged to produce high-quality recommendations\
    \ for\nnovice researchers based on a scrupulous evaluation of the available works.\n\
    The remaining article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background\n\
    of oil palm and ML. Section 3 explains the review scope and the proposed methodology.\n\
    It provides the step-by-step procedure followed during the design and implementation\n\
    phase. Accordingly, results are demonstrated in Section 4, while detailed discussion\
    \ is\npresented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the article.\n2. Background\
    \ of Oil Palm and Machine Learning\nThe Elaeis guineensis, commonly known as oil\
    \ palm, is a single-stemmed branchless\ntree, which takes several years of investment\
    \ and labour work before producing harvestable\noil containing fresh fruit bunch\
    \ (FFB) [25]. Two different kinds of vegetable oils are pro-\nduced from oil palm\
    \ fruit at ﬁrst, namely, crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil. CPO\nis extracted\
    \ from the pulp (mesocarp) of fruit, while its seeds provide palm kernel oil.\n\
    Average annual raw crop production remains 12–18 tons h−1 in industrial oil palm\
    \ under\nfavourable conditions [26]. Besides its proﬁtability and high production,\
    \ some complex\ncharacteristics distinguish it from other crops. Unlike annual,\
    \ biennial, and perennial crops,\nthe oil palms are permanent plants [27] harvested\
    \ twice a month throughout the plant’s\nlifespan (except the initial growing period)\
    \ [28,29]. Although some seasonal variations\nexist in oil palm yield, this divergence\
    \ is limited to production capacity [30]. The seasonal\nimpacts are considered\
    \ a noticeable factor in contributing to yield decline. Some additional\nyield-reducing\
    \ factors are fertilizers’ limitations, irrigation limitations, pests, and infections.\n\
    Careful regular analysis for disease assessment, fertilization, and timely harvesting\
    \ con-\ntributes to high oil palm yield. Conversely, inappropriate ﬁeld management\
    \ and incorrect\nharvesting strategies restrict the oil quality and quantity [31].\
    \ Besides all efforts to enhance\noil palm crop production, the yield-reducing\
    \ factors inﬂuence the outcomes signiﬁcantly.\nHowever, the factors mentioned\
    \ above are variable and interdependent but are not unpre-\ndictable. Indeed,\
    \ these sensitive issues are associated with some complicated parameters.\nAs\
    \ for fertilizer, its type, adequate quantity, and application frequency require\
    \ precise\noptimization. At the same time, the estimation of harvesting time [32]\
    \ is achieved with\npredictive analysis. Similarly, during disease assessment,\
    \ healthy and unhealthy plants are\nclassiﬁed. A decisive solution to such a complex\
    \ problem is rendered in machine learning\nalgorithms (MLAs) that perform prediction,\
    \ classiﬁcation, clustering, and optimization.\nDepending on research requirements,\
    \ an ML model can be predictive or/and descriptive.\nA predictive model is used\
    \ to forecast what is likely to happen in the future. On the\nother hand, a descriptive\
    \ model gathers knowledge from the collected data to describe\nwhat happened in\
    \ the past [33]. For solving the problems at hand, selection of the right\nalgorithms\
    \ is the key. Moreover, the utilized tools and chosen algorithms need to have\
    \ the\ncapability of handling bulk data. Aided by such intelligent algorithms,\
    \ well-calculated\nﬁeld management strategies can boost the revenue through enhanced\
    \ yield and optimized\nexpenses. In addition, the oil palm as a proﬁtable crop\
    \ also needs technology-oriented\ntools (to reduce labour costs) and cerebral\
    \ systems (to avoid the risk of human error) for\ndecision-making.\n3. Review\
    \ Scope and Methodology\nThis work reviews the existing studies that apply different\
    \ ML techniques to serve\nthe oil palm agricultural industry from a problem-solving\
    \ perspective. The proposed ML\nmethods are explored while emphasizing recent\
    \ research trends. We do not intend to\ncriticize previous contributions; moreover,\
    \ it is not a comparative analysis to support any\nspeciﬁc research work or algorithm.\
    \ To the best knowledge of the authors, barely any\nattempt could be discovered\
    \ in the existing literature that reviews “application of MLAs in\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 832\n4 of 26\nthe ﬁeld of oil palm” as a special case because research\
    \ on oil palm is limited. Such a dearth\ncan be acknowledged as a relatively novel,\
    \ yet promising, application ﬁeld. Moreover,\nthis review only considers MLAs\
    \ that offer enhanced estimates rather than optimization\nalgorithms taking a\
    \ long time for ﬁnding global optima. In addition, it does not consider\nsupplementary\
    \ research on the advantages/disadvantages of oil palm consumption as\nwell as\
    \ ﬁeld management strategies that sustain without ML. Those topics are not in\
    \ the\nscope and do not ﬁt the level of its speciﬁed target.\nFor this review,\
    \ the methodology was based on a systematic literature review ap-\nproach to perform\
    \ a hybrid qualitative–quantitative analysis. The motivation for using the\nconsolidated\
    \ analysis was to provide a better understanding of the results by weighing\n\
    the pros and cons of both techniques [34,35]. This method is susceptible to minimize\
    \ bias,\nenhance transparency, and preserve ﬂexibility [35,36]. In this study,\
    \ we organized our\nempirical outcomes and answers to the “research questions”\
    \ that are a central part of this\nresearch protocol. Moreover, a dual phased\
    \ systematic method is proposed where each\nphase comprises ﬁve major sections\
    \ as sub-steps. The procedure is described in Figure 1.\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\

    \ Scope and Boundary\nThe available literature on the topic was collected within\
    \ a unique range of ten years.\nOnly technical papers that propose the application\
    \ of any MLA to explore oil palm were\nconsidered. On the other hand, all the\
    \ articles that did not apply ML for agricultural\noil palm as a special case\
    \ were discarded. This was done to narrow down the search\nbecause applications\
    \ of ML occur in numerous ﬁelds that do not serve our domain-speciﬁc\ninvestigation.\
    \ For instance, a study was not included if it investigated public opinion\n(consumer\
    \ perception) on the impacts of palm oil using ML methods [38].\n3.1.4. Deﬁning\
    \ Exclusion Criteria\nTo incorporate only relevant publications, several exclusion\
    \ criteria were deﬁned to set\nboundaries for the review. In the systematic procedure\
    \ of article selection, seven exclusion\nprinciples were followed to ﬁlter the\
    \ database as described below.\n•\nExclusion Principle 1—publication that is not\
    \ related to the agricultural/industrial\nsector of oil palm with ML application.\n\
    •\nExclusion Principle 2—publication is written in any language other than English.\n\
    •\nExclusion Principle 3—publication is already retrieved/is a duplicate.\n•\n\
    Exclusion Principle 4—full text/abstract of the publication is unavailable.\n\
    •\nExclusion Principle 5—publications that are survey/review articles reviewing\n\
    old publications.\n•\nExclusion Principle 6—work that is published before 2011.\n\
    •\nExclusion Principle 7—publication is published after 2020.\n3.1.5. Research\
    \ Questions\nThe review objective was based on seven research questions (Qs).\n\
    •\nQ1—what is the annual rate of publications that apply machine learning to oil\
    \ palm?\n•\nQ2—what are research trends in this domain?\n•\nQ3—which MLAs have\
    \ been highly used during the previous ten years to serve\noil palm?\n•\nQ4—which\
    \ countries are actively involved in research on the application of machine\n\
    learning in oil palm?\n•\nQ5—what datasets/sources are used to investigate oil\
    \ palm with machine learning?\n•\nQ6—what are the key input features preferred\
    \ by researchers?\n•\nQ7—how are applied algorithms/ models evaluated to guarantee\
    \ the signiﬁcance and\nrationality of the outcomes?\n3.2. Implementation Phase\n\
    This section covers the procedures to acquire relevant literature. Primarily,\
    \ the articles\nthat contained standalone or hybrid ML models integrated with\
    \ other methods, precisely\napplied on oil palm, were searched. The choice of\

    Some articles were added to multipurpose classiﬁcation due to unique objectives.\n\
    Articles in this category are the works that have conducted the technical research\
    \ predom-\ninantly focused on classiﬁer’s performance. One of the studies included\
    \ in this group\nexplains the results of various marker systems and modelling\
    \ procedures for the imple-\nmentation of genome selection (GS) in the introgressive\
    \ hybridization of the dura family.\nThe discussed dura family “Deli x Nigerian,”\
    \ the resultant of a “Deli dura x Nigerian dura,”\nwas considered in the analysis\
    \ [41]. The observed family is a valuable source of new palm\ntrees with higher\
    \ oil yields and improved bunch characteristics. The work in [42] proposed\nJenks\
    \ natural breaks (JNB) for the classiﬁcation of chlorophyll sufﬁciency levels\
    \ and relative\nchlorophyll content. The best subset of frond number, chlorophyll-sensitive\
    \ wavelengths,\nand the classiﬁer to categorize the chlorophylls according to\
    \ the nominated sufﬁciency\nlevels were suggested using a hyperspectral remote\
    \ sensing platform. Correspondingly,\nthe use of hyperspectral sensing combined\
    \ with imbalance approaches and MLAs to track\nthe nutrients levels of mature\
    \ oil palm is highlighted in [43]. Hyperspectral spectroscopy\nhas emerged as\
    \ a promising alternative to conventional foliar analysis in assessing the\nnutritional\
    \ status of oil palms, as the former one is costly and time-consuming. Details\n\
    about classiﬁcation techniques used in the oil palm ﬁeld are provided in ﬁve different\n\

    \ Detection\nDiseases in oil palm are a major threat to global food supply and\
    \ security. Timely\ndetection of infected trees is a difﬁcult task due to the\
    \ lack of appropriate monitoring\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n12 of 26\nresources\
    \ for plants health assessment. Basal stem rot (BSR) is a common plant disease\n\
    instigated by the Ganoderma boninense (G. boninense) fungus, which passes on the\n\
    infection to oil palm plantations and causes a signiﬁcant economic loss. In need\
    \ of novel\ndisease detection techniques in order to reduce oil palm losses caused\
    \ by BSR, images along\nwith ﬁeld observations are utilized to perform classiﬁcations\
    \ of infected oil palm estate\nthrough different ML algorithms in [47]. The purpose\
    \ of this study was to use WorldView-3\nimagery to predict disease severity using\
    \ supervised learning algorithms, as well as to\nidentify the typical indicators\
    \ of BSR disease in oil palm at various levels of infection\nseverity. Infection\
    \ levels are classiﬁed from mild to severe using three different classes with\n\
    the help of various classiﬁcation algorithms. Similarly, Khaled et al. considered\
    \ the impacts\nof BSR by classifying the healthy and unhealthy leaves from collected\
    \ samples [48]. The\nfeasibility of using electrical properties, namely, impedance,\
    \ capacitance, dielectric constant,\nand dissipation factor, for rapid detection\
    \ of the BSR disease in oil palm trees was explored.\nThe detailed analysis was\
    \ performed using ﬁve different MLAs, of which three models\nwere exploited for\
    \ features selection and two performed classiﬁcation. Nevertheless,\nearly identiﬁcation\
    \ of G. boninense infection is the technique for controlling BSR because\ncontemporary\
    \ methods do not guarantee complete recovery after severe infection. The key\n\
    goal of a different study was to examine how well ML models can detect BSR infection\
    \ in\noil-palm-cultivated areas. The BSR disease distribution map was also created\
    \ through MLA\ncombined with remote-sensing techniques [11]. The rotten bunch\
    \ disease was detected\nin [49]. Another study found that healthy trees can be\
    \ differentiated from BSR-infected\ntrees through intelligent algorithms even\
    \ in early-stage with less visible symptoms [50].\nTable 3 includes itemized material\

    \ monitoring is not quite new in modern agricultural\npractices. Aerial colour\
    \ and colour-infrared imaging have been used to track crop growth\nfor more than\
    \ 50 years. These methods are currently being re-evaluated for analysis in\nprecision\
    \ agriculture. UAVs are becoming more popular due to their low cost and ability\n\
    to ﬂy on low altitudes, which increases the spatial resolution [51]. The aerial\
    \ imagery\ncan be acquired rapidly during crucial periods of crop development.\
    \ For oil palm ﬁeld\nmonitoring through UAV and classiﬁcation of crop segments\
    \ based on resulting images,\nlinear regression was performed in [52]. Similarly,\
    \ ref. [53–56] collected images of oil palm\nfrom UAV for counting or detection\
    \ of oil palm trees by applying different ML techniques.\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\

    \ is a plentiful scope for research on forecasting methods to support in many\n\
    phases during oil palm cultivation’s lifecycle. The studies stated that the current\
    \ issue in\nagricultural oil palm is the high difference between potential and\
    \ actual yields. However,\nthe broad application of multidisciplinary ML methods\
    \ can overcome this issue. Many\nfactors inﬂuence crop yield, including crop genotype,\
    \ environment, and management\nstrategies. Year-to-year and location-to-location\
    \ differences in crop yield are greatly in-\nﬂuenced by changing environments,\
    \ both spatially and temporally. Accurate harvesting\ntime, seeds’ sowing time,\
    \ irrigation requirements, price prediction, and yield estimation is\nextremely\
    \ beneﬁcial to the production of global food under such circumstances. Decisions\n\
    on appropriate import and export can be made on the basis of reliable forecasts\
    \ [57]. In\norder to implement an appropriate harvesting strategy, oil palm harvest\
    \ time is predicted\nbased on fruit growth and ripeness level with regression\
    \ analysis [58]. An oil palm pre-\ndiction model to estimate production from cultivated\
    \ area images and tree age estimation\nis proposed in [59]. Forthcoming CPO prices\
    \ are predicted in [60,61] based on historical\ntrends in CPO prices. The performances\
    \ of two regression models trained from historical\ndata of oil palm production\
    \ are compared to predict future production in [62]. At the\nsame time, a simple\
    \ prediction model has been proposed to simulate the impacts of the\nenvironment\
    \ on variance in the inﬂorescences and the number of harvested bunches [63].\n\
    Similarly, another study introduced a standard simulation model to predict the\
    \ growth of\noil palm trees and the potential yield [64]. The impacts of foliar\
    \ nutrients’ compositions\nhave been analysed to model and predict the oil palm\
    \ yield of Malaysia, inclusive of\nhistorical trends in FFB yield [65]. Likewise,\
    \ annual oil palm yield is predicted, and climate\nimpacts are explored, in [66].\
    \ Finally, small-scale oil palm yield has been predicted with the\nhelp of historical\
    \ yield data and multiple environmental factors [67]. The above-discussed\nliterature\
    \ is part of Table 5.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n14 of 26\nTable 5. Prediction/estimation.\n\

    \ the fastest-growing crops in terms of agricultural land use, and\ntheir development\
    \ has been linked to substantial damage to the environment. As a result,\nthis\
    \ crop often appears in open and procedural discussions that are hindered or skewed\
    \ by\na lack of reliable conservational data. The shortage of consistent cultivation\
    \ information\nin particular has continued to be a source of concern. Recent advances\
    \ in remote-sensing\ndata access and the ability of ML have played a remarkable\
    \ role to address this issue. In\nthis regard, the study in [10] has obviously\
    \ contributed not only to oil palm tree detection,\nbut it also incorporates ML\
    \ for tree counting with adequate accuracy. Tree counting along\nwith young and\
    \ mature tree identiﬁcation is carried out by Okoro et al. [69]. Some other\n\
    studies [70–73] also performed similar work related to tree counting, age estimation,\
    \ or\ntree detection but differ in study level, data sets, and algorithms. Another\
    \ wide variety\nof researchers seems more concerned about oil palm area mapping,\
    \ globally and locally,\nas [74,75] and many more have proposed models to monitor\
    \ oil palm area expansion,\ncovered land, plantation detection, patterns of land\
    \ use for oil palm plantation, above-\nground biomass, oil palm ﬁelds observation,\
    \ and so on. Particulars on the above-discussed\ncontributions are provided in\
    \ Table 6. It covers all reviewed articles implementing various\nmodels to detect\
    \ land cover, oil palm cultivation, or expansion. However, no model has\nbeen\
    \ proposed to differentiate oil palm from other similar trees like date palm and\
    \ coconut\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n15 of 26\npalm. This research gap may cause\

    \ oil palm’s FFB based on its ripeness stage and other characteristics is\nneeded\
    \ for sorting and harvesting to obtain the supplementary quantity and upheld oil\n\
    quality that is compulsory to meet international standards. Ordinarily, oil palm\
    \ harvest\ntime is deﬁned by its fruit maturity stage that guarantees a high oil\
    \ extraction ratio (OER)\nby avoiding over-ripe, under-ripe, or unripe fruit harvest.\
    \ As FFB is the ﬁrst raw product\ngathered from oil palm cultivation, its sensitivity\
    \ towards the ripeness stage motivated\ntoo many researchers for utilizing machine\
    \ vision to determine fruit age, size, quality,\netc. that is vital to ripeness\
    \ stage identiﬁcation. A large portion of the reviewed litera-\nture consists\
    \ of methods and models for ripeness detection. The study in [45] makes a\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ contribution by demonstrating that the blue to red ﬂuorescence ratio-index\n\
    can be used to evaluate the oil palm FFB maturity. Real FFB samples were observed\
    \ for\ndifferentiating among maturity stages. On the other hand, ref. [88] processed\
    \ FFB images\nto perform classiﬁcation for fruit maturity level identiﬁcation.\
    \ Using the artiﬁcial fuzzy\nlogic and red-green-blue (RGB) colour model, an automatic\
    \ fruit grading system for oil\npalm was proposed in [89]. The resulting grading\
    \ system can differentiate among various\ntypes of oil palm fruits based on colour\
    \ intensity to describe ripeness level. Another study\nused a hyperspectral-based\
    \ method for ripeness detection of FFB [90]. Conversely, Makky\net al. proposed\
    \ a multiclass classiﬁcation method integrated with machine vision to de-\nvelop\
    \ a fruit grading machine [91]. By applying mathematical equations and regression\n\
    analysis, ref. [92] describes a method to estimate the maturity stage and age\
    \ of oil palm\nFFB based on its location in the phyllotaxis as an added element\
    \ to conﬁrm the maturity\nlevel. Another straightforward model was introduced\
    \ to build a tool for oil palm fruit\nripeness detection in [93]. The method of\
    \ image segmentation to discriminate the region of\noil palm fruit was proposed\
    \ in [94]. To accomplish the segmentation method, Gaussian\nﬁltering has been\
    \ developed for reducing image background noise. Likewise, an edge\ndetection\
    \ process has been introduced to obtain an outline of the oil palm fruit. Through-\n\
    out [45,46,88–92,95–107], it was discovered that although adopted methods, ideas,\
    \ and\ninput data varies, key objectives largely remained on the analysis of oil\
    \ palm fruit, which\ncan be seen in Table 7.\nTable 7. Oil palm fruit analysis.\n\

    5.1. Results-Based Discussion\nThis subsection provides the discussion of obtained\
    \ results referred to in the preceding\nsection. As observed, the annual number\
    \ of published articles is progressive but lacks\nvariety in objectives. Around\
    \ 33% of the research focused on fruit classiﬁcation methods.\nMainly, the authors\
    \ performed FFB analysis for fruit ripeness detection, which is crucial\nto estimate\
    \ harvesting time. In most of these studies, the images of FFB and real oil palm\n\
    fruit samples were collected to detect differences among four ripeness stages,\
    \ namely\nunripe, under-ripe, ripe, and overripe fruit. However, due to some common\
    \ features\nbetween consecutive stages, ripeness identiﬁcation becomes difﬁcult\
    \ with conventional\nclassiﬁcation approaches. Some authors also proposed useful\
    \ features for image processing\nand oil palm fruit classiﬁcation. In the category\
    \ of work carried for health assessment,\nnamely, the disease detection group,\
    \ several MLAs were applied. Although 7% of the\nresearch revolved around the\
    \ detection of disease and infection in oil palm, the amount of\nwork done was\
    \ insufﬁcient considering the importance of the problem. Similarly, another\n\
    7% of research was dedicated to canopy monitoring using UAV, while the multipurpose\n\
    classiﬁcation group with various assorted objectives also constituted 7% of the\
    \ total number\nof reviewed articles.\nAnother noticeable trend according to objectives\
    \ in reviewed works was land and\ntrees observation, which contributed to 30%\
    \ of the reviewed literature. The impetus to use\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n\
    18 of 26\nML for this purpose was derived from two dominant needs. First, the\
    \ difﬁculty in counting\noil palm trees manually and second is to monitor the\
    \ expansion of oil palm cultivation as\nit is considered a threat to tropical\
    \ forests, biodiversity, and associated ecosystems. For\nbetter supervision, the\
    \ reviewed studies used classiﬁcation techniques with remote sensing\nand machine\
    \ vision to monitor oil-palm-cultivated areas. Remote sensing integrated with\n\
    classiﬁcation models is widely applied for tree detection, tree counting, oil\
    \ palm tree\nidentiﬁcation, and so on. Some authors preferred multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ [108] techniques\nover binary classiﬁcation [109] for oil palm detection.\n\
    Apart from classiﬁcation, regression analysis is also another prevailing research\
    \ area.\nThis category is mainly concerned with applying ML for estimation and\
    \ prediction. In the\nreviewed studies, various regression models were proposed\
    \ to achieve different objectives\nof forecasting such as oil palm growth, oil\
    \ quantity, FFB yield, palm oil prices, and seasonal\nvariations. Although progress\
    \ in forecasting with ML is praiseworthy, it is not satisfactory.\nThe results\
    \ of the review suggest that forecasting with ML in oil palm is still in its early\n\
    stages, and several obstacles have to be overcome. Obviously, ML is underutilized\
    \ in the\noil palm industry for descriptive and predictive analysis. Nonetheless,\
    \ it is anticipated\nthat, sooner or later, ML is likely to contribute to solving\
    \ more challenging problems in\nagriculture and speciﬁcally for the ﬁeld of oil\
    \ palm as part of agriculture 5.0 [110].\nRegarding applied algorithms, deep insight\
    \ into the results shows that the application\nof algorithms differs in relation\
    \ to the objectives in deﬁned categories. For instance, for fruit\nclassiﬁcation,\
    \ ANN is implemented by researchers more frequently than other algorithms.\nBeing\
    \ a deep learning algorithm, ANN automatically performs feature extraction. Three\n\
    parameters that determine the performance of the algorithm are the number of layers,\
    \ the\nnumber of neurons in each hidden layer, and the connections among neurons.\
    \ Network\nsize optimization is vital in order to attain a viable model in terms\
    \ of learning rate and\ncomputational complexity [111]. To detect symptoms of\
    \ disease and infection, SVM and\nRF algorithms are preferred. The reason behind\
    \ the widespread use of these methods is\ntheir capability to learn from small\
    \ but complex data in a simple way. Accordingly, ANN is\nthe most popular algorithm\
    \ for prediction, followed by linear regression and SVM. The\nranking of algorithms\
    \ is performed on the basis of usage frequency instead of precision.\nIt should\
    \ be noted that the high frequency of SVM does not indicate its best performance\n\
    alone. Mainly, it is due to the appropriateness of SVM for both regression and\
    \ classiﬁcation\nproblems and its reliability as a standard algorithm for performance\
    \ benchmarking.\nConcerning countries involved in research on oil palm, results\
    \ indicate that researchers\nfrom Malaysia, Indonesia, UK, the USA, Australia,\
    \ China, Thailand, and the Netherlands\nare actively participating. From the literature,\
    \ it was also found that some prominent re-\nsearch and development (R&D) organizations\
    \ in the world like CENIPALMA (Columbia),\nNIFOR (Nigeria), CIRAD (France), IOPRI\
    \ (Indonesia), and MPOB (Malaysia) deal with\nmultiple aspects of oil palm plantation\
    \ development in their countries. FELDA is another\nlocal government agency in\
    \ Malaysia that encourages different organizations for agri-\ncultural research\
    \ [112,113]. Current development in the global and Malaysian oil palm\nindustry\
    \ is a result of signiﬁcant research combined with good management, a compatible\n\
    climate, and well-established infrastructure [112]. Given one full credit to each\
    \ author,\nstatistics revealed that Malaysia is ranked number 1 for publishing\
    \ approximately 62% of\nthe articles, followed by Indonesia with 18% of the articles\
    \ of the reviewed material.\nInvestigation about data sources found that Google\
    \ earth engine (GEE), QuickBird,\nWorldview3, as well as some other tools and\
    \ repositories provided considerable satellite\nimagery. The vast amount of self-collected\
    \ site-speciﬁc images, ﬁeld samples, expert opin-\nions, and lab test results\
    \ were also well utilized. The availability of satellite images is\nadvantageous,\
    \ but it is also an indication of a massive shortage of freely available quantita-\n\
    tive data for research in the oil palm ﬁeld. Data unavailability is the main challenge\
    \ for\nprecision farming of oil palm since consistent ﬁeld data collection is\
    \ a time-consuming and\nchallenging task. The ﬁndings reveal that data collection\
    \ is progressing with several im-\npediments like difﬁculty in quantifying yield-reducing\
    \ factors and real-time data storages.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n19 of 26\n\
    A collaborative database management system (DBMS) integrated with big data and\
    \ cloud\ncomputing is entailed where oil palm observations gathered during the\
    \ entire lifespan of\nplants should be stacked by expert stakeholders since the\
    \ extensive application of ML is\nrestrained by the availability of gold standard\
    \ datasets containing ﬁne-grained qualitative\nand quantitative information.\n\
    Dealing with Q7 became complex due to many validation methods. Most of the\nresearchers\
    \ validated the algorithm with multiple techniques, and performance was also\n\
    compared with other existing algorithms. Some works did not clearly mention the\
    \ evalua-\ntion metrics, while few did not evaluate the algorithm at all. Expert\
    \ opinion and human\ngraders were also declared as the model’s performance evaluation\
    \ criteria in some studies.\nBased on the available information, it was found\
    \ that the most popular evaluation parame-\nter was overall accuracy (OA), followed\
    \ by classiﬁcation accuracy (CA), root mean squared\nerror (RMSE), and F1-score.\n\
    5.2. General Discussion\nSuch research was inclined to risks to validity as potential\
    \ threats to validity can be\nexternal, hypothetic validity, and consistency [114].\
    \ To address the aforementioned validity\nissues (i.e., external legitimacy and\
    \ construct rationality), queries with broad initial search\nkeywords returned\
    \ a considerable number of studies. The introduced search string covered\nthe\
    \ entire scope of the proposed review. For the reliability of the review, the\
    \ validity can be\nconsidered well addressed as the methodology of the review\
    \ was well explained. It can be\nsimulated as it is categorically replicable.\
    \ If this review is replicated, marginally different\nselected publications can\
    \ be returned, but the different personal judgments would be the\nreason behind\
    \ the potential differences. However, it is very unlikely to obtain dissimilar\n\
    overall ﬁndings.\n5.3. Search-Based Discussion\nPerhaps some important publications\
    \ have been intact. Different search strings could\nhave been applied, and a wider\
    \ search could have reverted with some different studies, but\nthe satisfactory\
    \ number of articles indicates that the search was broad enough to address\nthe\
    \ research questions. The most challenging part of searching for articles was\
    \ the inability\nof search engines to differentiate between “oil palm” (tree)\
    \ and “palm oil” (oil), which\ncaused a large number of less relevant articles.\
    \ Similarly, some articles containing the\nwords “palm” (part of hand), “coconut\
    \ oil,” “coconut palm,” and “date palm” were also\nsearched and were discarded\
    \ during article exclusion.\n5.4. Analysis Based Discussion\nAnother potential\
    \ threat to validity was the method of conducting analysis. All\npublications\
    \ did not clearly state the information required to answer our predeﬁned re-\n\
    search questions. In addition, strict organization of articles with more than\
    \ one objective\nor compound methodology was not possible. For example, “regression\
    \ for/and classiﬁ-\ncation,” “classiﬁcation for disease detection,” “FFB analysis\
    \ for classiﬁcation,” or “FFB\nanalysis for disease detection/prediction” and\
    \ “UAV for trees classiﬁcation” outwardly\ncaused duplication in the grouping.\
    \ However, the overall analysis remained focused on\nthe primary objective.\n\
    5.5. Research Questions Based Discussion\nSome relevant studies published during\
    \ our time range might have been missed\nbecause of different keywords. It was\
    \ practically not possible to include every individual\nMLA in our search string.\
    \ Deep learning and machine learning algorithms were not\nseparated explicitly.\
    \ Some of the articles were written by many authors from different\ncountries,\
    \ so the publications were calculated multiple times based on the afﬁliations\
    \ of\nauthors during geographical distribution analysis. Similarly, applied algorithms\
    \ were\ncalculated based on the frequency of use instead of precision. Performance\
    \ comparison\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 832\n20 of 26\nof the algorithms was not considered\
    \ in the results due to a variety of objectives and\nvaried data sets, including\
    \ some calculated parameters. SVM is ranked as the highest-\nused algorithm because\
    \ of the number of studies that applied it for hybrid modelling,\ncomparison,\
    \ and performance evaluation of the proposed model. With respect to data\nsources,\
    \ it was observed that proper distribution of the data set used was not possible\
    \ due\nto the wide range of sources and input variables. Similarly, evaluation\
    \ parameters vary in\ndifferent studies. In addition, many studies did not mention\
    \ evaluation parameters clearly.\nMost of the studies used multiple evaluation\
    \ parameters, which are considered just in case\nof being exceptionally mentioned\
    \ in work.\n5.6. Challenges-Based Discussion\nRegarding challenges, researchers\
    \ discussed general challenges in the form of research\nmotivation. Several challenges\
    \ are site or data-related, while other challenges were faced\nduring model implementation.\
    \ We explained only some common challenges conﬁned with\noil palm. Another separate\
    \ technical review is planned to discuss technical challenges\nencountered during\
    \ the application of different MLAs. From the current literature, the\nshortage\
    \ of data availability for important parameters seems the reason for the limited\n\
    performance of the proposed models. When site-speciﬁc interconnected parameters\
    \ are\nmeasured and included, proposed models will have better precision.\n6.\
    \ Conclusions\nThis study investigated existing research on the application of\
    \ machine learning in\noil palm actively carried out by researchers during the\
    \ last decade (2011–2020). For better\nunderstanding, the reviewed articles were\
    \ divided into two categories: classiﬁcation and\nregression analysis. The study\
    \ identiﬁed the key objectives in the classiﬁcation category as\ndisease detection,\
    \ multipurpose classiﬁcation, land cover/tree detection, fresh fruit bunch\nanalysis,\
    \ and automated canopy management/segmentation using UAV. In contrast, the\nregression\
    \ analysis included the prediction of FFB yield, CPO prices, harvest time, and\n\
    seasonal impacts on oil palm. It was evident from the results that the research\
    \ was mainly\nfocused on land cover/tree detection and oil palm plantation area\
    \ observation. The other\npreferred research direction was fresh fruit bunch ripeness\
    \ identiﬁcation. Surprisingly,\npredictive models for fruit yield, oil production,\
    \ plant growth, and disease forecasting have\nnot been widely applied. The results\
    \ clearly show that the highly applied algorithm was\nSVM followed by ANN, RF,\
    \ regression, and CART. A deeper analysis indicated the scarcity\nof available\
    \ data in the ﬁeld. Most of the data used for oil palm research was in the form\n\
    of images collected from different satellite or remote-sensing sources. Due to\
    \ the limited\ninvolvement of researchers from a small number of countries, several\
    \ important research\ndimensions were missing, such as soil classiﬁcation to identify\
    \ suitable land, automated\npest and weed recognition, identifying the symptoms\
    \ of sunlight, nutrients and water\nlimitations in oil palm crop, optimization\
    \ of fertilizers, seed assessment, and so on. Most\nimportantly, the research\
    \ trends in the literature showed that existing MLAs and techniques\nwere not\
    \ adequately coupled together to support effective decision-making systems as\n\
    compared to several other domains of ML applications. Current research is too\
    \ inadequate\nto design practically supportive tools that are capable of increasing\
    \ yields and improving\nquality and plantation sustainability in an environmentally\
    \ friendly way. Integrated ML\npractices such as big data, remote sensing, data\
    \ analytics, image-processing, and automated\ninformation extraction are progressing\
    \ to achieve knowledge-based oil palm agriculture.\nThis study provided a vivid\
    \ idea to understand the advancement of oil palm associated\nwith machine learning\
    \ and can inspire researchers to ﬁnd out the relevant problems in\nthis area.\
    \ Different outcomes of this study magnify the current research on “oil palm and\n\
    machine learning” from various perspectives. We believe this article will pave\
    \ the way to\nthe development of oil palm with the help of automation and intelligence.\n\
    To improve the research, future work should focus on a technical review to analyse\n\
    the performance of ML models applied in the oil palm agriculture domain.\nAgriculture\

    \ Chergui1 and Mohand Tahar Kechadi1,2* \nAbstract \nRecent advances in Information\
    \ and Communication Technologies have a signifi-\ncant impact on all sectors of\
    \ the economy worldwide. Digital Agriculture appeared \nas a consequence of the\
    \ democratisation of digital devices and advances in artificial \nintelligence\
    \ and data science. Digital agriculture created new processes for making \nfarming\
    \ more productive and efficient while respecting the environment. Recent and \n\
    sophisticated digital devices and data science allowed the collection and analysis\
    \ of \nvast amounts of agricultural datasets to help farmers, agronomists, and\
    \ professionals \nunderstand better farming tasks and make better decisions. In\
    \ this paper, we present \na systematic review of the application of data mining\
    \ techniques to digital agriculture. \nWe introduce the crop yield management\
    \ process and its components while limiting \nthis study to crop yield and monitoring.\
    \ After identifying the main categories of data \nmining techniques for crop yield\
    \ monitoring, we discuss a panoply of existing works \non the use of data analytics.\
    \ This is followed by a general analysis and discussion on the \nimpact of big\
    \ data on agriculture.\nKeywords: Digital agriculture, Data analytics, Crop management,\
    \ Big data, Data \nmining, Machine learning\nIntroduction\nDA, (also called digital\
    \ farming or smart farming)1 [78, 105, 130], is a modern approach \nthat uses\
    \ digital and smart devices [sensors, cameras, satellite, drones, the Global Posi-\n\
    tioning System (GPS)] in conjunction with Data Mining (or data analytics) to improve\
    \ \nproductivity and to optimise the use of resources. Digital Agriculture (DA)\
    \ comes as a \nresponse to the increasing demand for improving productivity while\
    \ reducing farming \noperational costs. Moreover, the improvement of productivity\
    \ should not be done at \nany cost, e.g., overuse of natural resources and chemical\
    \ products. DA can, for example, \nmanage crop growth by finding appropriate fertilisation\
    \ program for each farming field \nand can help farmers to reduce their operational\
    \ costs and respect the environment by \nrefining their farming operations based\
    \ on the needs of each part of the farming field.\nSince agriculture has a direct\
    \ and significant impact on the population and therefore \nits economic environment,\
    \ DA in its turn should be viewed as the next natural step to \n*Correspondence:\

    \ the environment, by taking \nadvantage of the recent technological advances\
    \ in digital devices, communications sys-\ntems, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ These allow us to construct multidimensional domains, \nwhere the farms and\
    \ farmers are their central subjects. Figure 1 shows the agriculture \necosystem\
    \ and its direct impact on other sectors of the economy.\nBesides, since DA involves\
    \ the development, adoption and iteration with digital tech-\nnologies [39], and\
    \ Artificial Intelligence (data analytics, ...), these developments and \ninteractions\
    \ should be well-defined (laws, regulations and policies) to guarantee rights\
    \ \nand benefits of all the involved actors (farmers, farm holders’, data owners’,\
    \ developers \nand analysts, technology vendors’,...) [70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146].\n\
    DA can be regarded as a data driven form of farming, in which decision-making\
    \ pro-\ncesses are based on explicit information derived from data collected through\
    \ various \nsources [148]. DA and Precision Agriculture (PA) seem to refer to\
    \ the same thing, how-\never, as stated in [148], DA involves the development\
    \ and adoption of modern technolo-\ngies in both collecting the data and its analysis\
    \ in various farming contexts, while PA \ntakes into account only the in-field\
    \ variability [147]. DA aims to exploit advanced digital \ndevices, ranging from\
    \ a simple sensor to complex robots, to offer the required farmland \ntreatment\
    \ with high accuracy. DA can be applied in almost all agricultural fields. For\
    \ \ninstance, in crop production: DA allows accurate management of crops, which\
    \ includes \nfields, wasteland, crop, pest, and irrigation management, soil classification,\
    \ etc. In Ani-\nmal production: DA allows monitoring the animal over its whole\
    \ life cycle, its food \nquantity, health control and protection from diseases,\
    \ and so on. Fishery, animal Hus-\nbandry, livestock and dairy farming are some\
    \ examples [14]. In Forestry: We can effi-\nciently manage forests by supporting\
    \ the environmental and sustainable decision [36]. \nDA can help in detecting\
    \ unhealthy trees, air pollution, discriminate different tree spe-\ncies, protect\
    \ the wildlife, etc. From the economy point of view, the application of DA for\
    \ \nforest management enhances the wood quality and its production, which can\
    \ augment \nprofits; reduce waste and maintain the environment [138].\nAddressing\
    \ DA from all the above mentioned views is a challenging task and cannot \nbe\
    \ achieved without the participation of specialists from all these sectors. In\
    \ this study, \nFig. 1 The interlocked sectors involved in DA\nPage 3 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nwe focus\
    \ on the use of Big Data in crop management, it is, not only one of the pillars\
    \ in \nagriculture but also it can profoundly affect biodiversity. Moreover, crop\
    \ growth is a very \ncomplex process involving various endogenous and exogenous\
    \ factors. Recent advances \nin digital technologies allow us to collect data\
    \ about all these factors. DA has the ability \nto elucidate the correlations\
    \ and interactions of these factor to help farmers and agrono-\nmists optimise\
    \ the productivity while reducing the side effects on the environment. DA \nexhibits\
    \ several benefits to agriculture as shown in Figure  2. These benefits were dis-\n\
    cussed in [10, 13, 70, 98, 104, 112, 113, 130, 135, 148] and summarised in the\
    \ following:\n• DA provides a farmer with useful information to support their\
    \ decision-making pro-\ncesses, such as soil and weather monitoring and prediction,\
    \ weed and pest monitor-\ning, crop yield dynamic predictions, etc.\n• DA can\
    \ sustain the environment and improve the products’ quality, since it provides\
    \ \nhigh quality information and measurements for optimal farming operations on\
    \ each \nfield.\n• DA can provide farmers advanced management methods against\
    \ climate change and \nother environmental challenges. The farmer can continuously\
    \ monitor crop growth \nand protect them against diseases.\n• DA offers valuable\
    \ feedback to farmers and good assessment of risks, to minimise \nmicrobiological\
    \ or disaster-related risks.\n• DA can provide prediction and assistance to farmers\
    \ against adverse weather inci-\ndence, disasters and market instability by assessing\
    \ the loss at the farm level.\n• Farmers/agronomists can benefit from advanced\
    \ models to understand the market \nand forecast which products could be more\
    \ profitable.\nThe contributions of this study are in the investigation of big\
    \ data analytics applications \nto crop production. Crop farming is a complex\
    \ task, and it depends on many factors that \nshould be taken into account. To\
    \ optimise the operational cost and reduce the impact \non the environment, the\
    \ big data analytics emerges as one of the most cost effective \napproaches nowadays.\
    \ The contributions, therefore, include the following:\nFig. 2 Role of DA in crop\

    \ with a presentation of the \nconceptual-layered framework to show the effectiveness\

    \ if the historical data is available, carefully \ncollected, and it is of high\
    \ quality.\n• A highlight of the different types of data used in the existing\

    \ in small and \nlarge scale holders.\n• A discussion on Digital Agriculture challenges\
    \ and potential paths for future \nresearch.\nMethodology\nTo study the impact\
    \ of data analytics and big data on DA based on previous works, we \nconducted\
    \ a systematic review approach that consists of three steps: (1) collection of\
    \ \nrelated work, (2) selection of relevant work, and (3) examination and analysis\
    \ of the fil-\ntered related work.\nIn the first step, we performed keyword-based\
    \ research and We gathered a large \nnumber of studies from well-known and popular\
    \ online sources (Web of Science, Sco-\npus, IEEEXplore, ACM, etc.). We used a\
    \ combination of keywords from the two sets \n(Big data, data mining, data analytics,\
    \ machine learning, Internet Of Things, sensors) \nand (Digital agriculture, smart\
    \ farming, precision agriculture, agriculture, farming). We \ngathered more than\
    \ 327 articles. In the next steps, We selected a small number of arti-\ncles,\
    \ which are considered relevant for further analysis, based on their ideas, methods,\
    \ \ndata types and sources, addressed problems, proposed solutions, tools used\
    \ and quality \nof the results.\nThrough the literature analysis, the study aims\
    \ to find responses to the following \nresearch questions and discuss findings\
    \ in the following sections.\n• What is the process of DA for crop management?\n\
    • What are the various data types generated by farms and used in DA applications\
    \ for \ncrop management?\n• What role does big data analytics play in DA?\n• How\
    \ are big data analytics used for crop management?\n• What are the influences\
    \ of the farm’s scale on the application of DA?\n• How big is the data used in\
    \ the proposed DA solutions’?\n• What are the challenges facing the DA?\nPage\

    Related work\nDespite that DA and Big Data being relatively recent research fields,\
    \ their scientific lit-\nerature is rich and covers several concepts. As DA is\
    \ at the cross boundaries between \nagriculture and ICT, three major dimensions\
    \ have emerged as of a very high importance; \ntechnology, social economics and\
    \ ethics, and decision-making based on Machine Learn-\ning. The first dimension\
    \ focuses on the use of advanced technologies to improve prac-\ntices and productivity\
    \ [56, 124]. In Ref. [124], the authors studied the impact of sensor \nnetworks\
    \ in agriculture, including remote sensing technologies, wireless devices, and\
    \ \nother IoT devices. Ref. [56] reviewed some developments in remote sensing\
    \ within Big \nData processing and management in agriculture. The second dimension\
    \ concerns legal, \nethics, social and economic factors of DA, to provide insights\
    \ into the impact of digit-\nised information and its analysis on the farm management;\
    \ farmer identity, skills, pri-\nvacy, production, and value chains in food systems\
    \ [39, 70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146, 148]. The \nthird dimension focuses on the application\
    \ of big data analysis and machine learning \n(ML), to optimise and forecast the\
    \ production and the use of resources. In this paper, we \nonly consider this\
    \ dimension.\nVarious studies have been conducted on the application of data analytics\
    \ to crop yield \nmanagement. For instance, [71] presented a systematic review\
    \ on crop yield prediction \nusing ML techniques, and extracted major ML algorithms,\
    \ features and evaluation met-\nrics used in those studies. Ref.[35] discussed\
    \ the yield estimation by integrating agrarian \nfactors in ML techniques. This\
    \ allowed them to show a strong relationship between crop \nyield and climatic\
    \ factors. Ref. [103] Provided a systematic review on the use of com-\nputer vision\
    \ and AI to enhance the grain quality of five crops (maize, rice, wheat, soy-\n\
    bean and barley), disease detection and phenotyping. Ref. [64] reviewed the application\

    \ 9:123 \nof big data analysis in some fields of agriculture. It highlighted solutions\
    \ to some key \nwell-known problems, used tools and algorithms, along with input\
    \ datasets. The authors \nconcluded that big data analytics in agriculture is\
    \ still at its early stage, and many bar-\nriers need to be overcome, despite\
    \ the availability of the data and tools to analyse it. To \nmeasure the level\
    \ of usage of big data in DA, the authors defined big data metrics (low, \nmedium,\
    \ high) for each of its dimensions (volume, velocity, and variety). However, while\
    \ \nit is a very simple model, it is not easy to specify thresholds, as some dimensions,\
    \ such \nas volume and velocity depend on technological advances. Ref. [12] presented\
    \ a review \non the use of ML methods to detect biotic stress in crop protection.\
    \ The authors ana-\nlysed the potential of these techniques and their suitability\
    \ to deal with crop protection \nfrom weeds, diseases and insects. In addition,\
    \ they provided very good instructive exam-\nples from different fields of DA.\
    \ An earlier similar study was presented in [89], where \nthe authors studied\
    \ four very popular learning approaches; Artificial Neural Network \n(ANN), Support\
    \ Vector Machine (SVM), K-means, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). \nRef. [25] presented\
    \ a survey on data mining clustering methods applied to food and agri-\ncultural\
    \ domains. It first described major techniques of unsupervised classification,\
    \ then \nit examined some existing techniques applied to agriculture products;\
    \ like fruit clas-\nsification, wine classification, analysis of remote sensing\
    \ in forest images and machine \nvision.\nThis study is not just an update of\
    \ previous surveys. The main objective is to examine \nthe effectiveness of big\
    \ data analytics in crop yield monitoring and discuss the challenges \nof such\
    \ paradigm shift in the agriculture domain. Moreover, It is important to under-\n\
    stand the sources of datasets, their types, and which ML techniques are more suitable\
    \ to \nanalyse them.\nDA: it’s all about data\nDigital Agriculture (DA) relies\
    \ heavily on the data sources and techniques used to col-\nlect it. This data\
    \ is then organised in agricultural data warehouses and analysed [93]. The \n\
    results of this data analysis provide significant insights to farmers and agronomists\
    \ about \nhow to improve the production, minimise the farming operational costs,\
    \ manage risks, \nand protect the environment. The process of deploying DA is\
    \ derived from data science.\nDigital agriculture process\nFigure  4, adopted\
    \ from the knowledge pyramid DIKW, shows a data-driven process, \nwhich is at\
    \ the heart of DA. This usually shows how data from past experiences and \nmodels\
    \ serve as input to techniques of mining and analysis to help in future decisions\
    \ \nand acting accordingly. The newly collected data will be used to further refine\
    \ the pro-\ncess and adapt it to an ever-evolving agricultural world.\nThis is\
    \ a data-driven methodology derived from the overall knowledge discovery pro-\n\
    cess. The first phase, data collection, is crucial to the validity of the whole\
    \ analysis. One \nneeds to carefully identify the type of data that should be\
    \ collected and the approach \nof gathering it and maintain it through its whole\
    \ life cycle. This is even more complex \nin DA, as the data is issued from various\
    \ and heterogeneous sources, and contains a \nnumber of factors of uncertainties.\
    \ The second phase, data representation and analysis, \nis very sophisticated,\
    \ as there is no common standards in the way the data should be \nPage 7 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nintegrated,\
    \ consolidated, to derive a unified representation that is suitable for its analy-\n\
    sis, and in the choice of the analysis techniques. Finally, the decision-making\
    \ is a labori-\nous task, where the extracted knowledge will be associated to\
    \ the expertise of farmers \nand agronomists, farming constraints and regulations\
    \ to derive new management pro-\ncesses with the view to improve productivity\
    \ and quality of products, reduce and their \nimpact on the environment. Figure\
    \  5 depicts a diagram presenting the DA process for \ncrop yield monitoring,\
    \ as explained below.\n• Data collection and preparation It is important to identify\
    \ the data types and attrib-\nutes based on the problem at hand (e.g., crop management),\
    \ and the level of granu-\nlarity of the data. The required data sources should\
    \ also be identified and assessed for \ntheir data quality. As mentioned above,\
    \ the data is then prepared for analysis. This \nincludes data integration, representation,\
    \ selection, transformation, etc.\nFig. 4 DA– a data-driven process\nFig. 5 Big\
    \ Data Analytics system architecture for crop yield monitoring\nPage 8 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n• Data analysis\
    \ the complex nature of the agricultural data requires an elaborative \nanalysis\
    \ approach, ranging from methods of feature selection or extraction to various\
    \ \nlearning algorithms to discover models, patterns (or knowledge in general\
    \ term) for \ndata analysis. These will be evaluated against the expected quality\
    \ of results and their \nsuitability to a decision-making process.\n• Decision-making\
    \ The main goal of the DA process is the decision-making. Any deci-\nsion should\
    \ follow the state-of-the-art practice, be justifiable and scientifically sound.\n\
    Digital agriculture data\nIn agriculture, Very large amounts of data can be collected\
    \ from various sources. These \ninclude sensors, weather stations, satellite imagery,\
    \ drone imagery, and many other \ninstruments. The datasets include weather data,\
    \ farm records, environmental condi-\ntions, soil parameters (nutrients, texture,\
    \ moisture, and so on. The data is usually rich, \nlarge, very complex, and heterogeneous.\
    \ Therefore, its analysis is not straightforward.\nThe heterogeneity is not only\
    \ expressed by the data types and formats, but it can be \ncollected using different\
    \ equipment of different quality. In addition, historical data may \nbe described\
    \ with different sets of attributes compared to very recent data. This can pre-\n\
    sent inconsistencies in naming conventions and measures when the data is collected\
    \ \nfrom different locations and times. Moreover, the data can be static and historical,\
    \ which \nis considered as offline data, and can be online weather data collected\
    \ at regular intervals \n(streams of data values), such as weather data (e.g.,\
    \ every 15 minutes), satellite imagery, \nwhich is characterised of being spatio-temporal,\
    \ such as Geo-spatial data, Moderate-\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ images, etc.\nAs mentioned earlier, the data collection is not well tackled\
    \ in the literature. Most \nof the studies assume that the data is known already,\
    \ and the experimental setup was \nalready in place. Therefore, more effort is\
    \ allocated to the data analysis and interpreta-\ntion rather than on the complete\
    \ environmental parameters and conditions. In the fol-\nlowing sections, we discuss\
    \ the data analysis process. This discussion is structured based \non the main\
    \ categories of the data analysis; classification, and clustering [24]. Note that,\
    \ \nfor high quality results, the data needs to be pre-processed, as discussed\
    \ in the previous \nsection. The pre-processing includes cleaning (dealing with\
    \ missing values, redundant \ndata, noise and outliers), data transformation,\
    \ dimensionality or data reduction, and so \non.\nClassification for crop monitoring\n\
    Big Data analytics system architecture is depicted in Fig.  5. While this system\
    \ is tar-\ngeted specifically to crop yield management, it can be adapted to any\
    \ data-driven appli-\ncation. This architecture implements faithfully what we\
    \ have highlighted in the previous \nsections. In this section, we will focus\
    \ on the data analysis layer of the architecture, \nmoreover, we will pay attention\
    \ to the data types and their sources, techniques of data \nacquisition, the learning\
    \ algorithms. The main objective of the crop management data \nanalysis is to\
    \ get some insights about the crop monitoring problems and show the poten-\ntial\
    \ of DA through big data analytics, also called data mining. Data mining and its\
    \ tech-\nniques are involved in several roles in crop production. Farmers may\
    \ want to know the \nPage 9 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \
    \         (2022) 9:123 \n \nfuture yield of their crop, specific areas of their\
    \ farms suffer from the spread of weeds \nor under-nutrition. Researchers can\
    \ look for information such as plant growth patterns, \noptimum growing conditions,\
    \ best pest and disease control environment and so on. Data \nmining offers panoply\
    \ of sophisticated techniques required to meet all of these needs.\nThere are\
    \ two major categories of data analysis: Classification and Clustering. In the\
    \ \nwork of [24], authors studied applications of data mining techniques in crop\
    \ manage-\nment and proposed a classification of these applications. They found\
    \ that the classifi-\ncation and clustering are the main used categories, where\
    \ the classification includes \nprediction, detection, protection, and categorisation).\
    \ The choice between classification \nor clustering analysis is very simple. If\
    \ the models or classes we are looking for were \nknown in advance and we have\
    \ an annotated data to support the training of the learn-\ning algorithms, then\
    \ classification is the right choice. However, the annotated data is not \nalways\
    \ available and easy to generate, and in many cases we do not know even which\
    \ \nmodels or patterns we are looking for. In these situations, clustering analysis\
    \ is the right \nalternative.\nIn this section, we focus on the studies that use\
    \ classification methods for their data \nanalysis. Clustering analysis will be\
    \ covered in the next section. We structure these clas-\nsification studies based\
    \ on the application objectives or targets which arecategorisation, \nprediction,\
    \ detection, and protection.\nCategorisation\nWhile the classification main objective\
    \ is to assign a given object into one of the pre-\ndetermined classes, in the\
    \ agricultural world, the use of classification process may vary \ndepending on\
    \ the stakeholders interests. In this study, we report four different applica-\n\
    tions (or targets) which are widely used in agriculture categorisation, prediction,\
    \ detec-\ntion, and protection.\nCategorisation aims at defining the classes (or\
    \ class labels) based on the simple recog-\nnition of similarities that exist\
    \ across a set of entities. For example, categorisation can \nbe used to classify\
    \ small fruit from fruit with normal to big size, to make an estima-\ntion of\
    \ yields; which may have an economic impact if the farmer wants to make different\
    \ \npackages or prices for each type of fruit separately. It can also be used\
    \ to classify dam-\naged crops from good ones in order to estimate losses, or\
    \ to prepare for the harvest and \nmarketing. Categorisation can also be applied\
    \ for crop mapping (e.g., poor, average, high \nyield), which aims to provide\
    \ information on farmed fields given a specific type of crops, \nor to identify\
    \ a type of crops that are more suitable for a particular field. Based on the\
    \ \ninput data, categorisation can help improve the farming operations based on\
    \ the mean-\ningful categories (classes) predefined in advance.\nProducing accurate\
    \ crop maps is essential for effective agricultural monitoring [131]. \nCategorisation\
    \ approaches can be applied to study regional crop distribution within or \npost\
    \ growing season. For this purpose, it can offer:\n• A good understanding of how\
    \ crops are distributed at early stage of their develop-\nment; allowing for an\
    \ opportune decision making and management, as well as \nadjusting crop planting\
    \ structure, is crucial. Besides, the timely available of (spatial \nPage 10 of\
    \ 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nor maps)\
    \ distribution of crop types is required for statistical and economic purposes\
    \ \n[131].\n• The availability of crops maps is critical for the diverse agricultural\
    \ monitoring activi-\nties, such as crop acreage estimation, yield modelling,\
    \ harvest operation schedules \n[131, 144], etc.\nMoreover, categorisation has\
    \ been applied for agricultural field mapping [31], to quan-\ntify the cropping\
    \ intensity for small-scale farms [58], to identify and map crops and to \nretrieve\
    \ the area of major cultivation [100] and to classify land-cover and crop [76].\
    \ \nTable  1 highlights the major fields, ideas and tools used for crops categorisation.\
    \ We can \nsee that data issued from satellites and remote sensing, and the features\
    \ with vegetation \nindices especially NDVI and EVI, the RGB colours, are the\
    \ most used.\nCrop yield prediction\nThe estimation of crop yield is crucial in\
    \ DA, as it enables efficient planning of resources. \nEconomically, an early\
    \ and accurate prediction of yields can help decision-makers to \nreact to the\
    \ crops market. Moreover, crop yield prediction permits the study of factors \n\
    that influence and affect the production, such as climate and weather, natural\
    \ soil fer-\ntility and its physical structure and topography, crop stress, the\
    \ incidence of pests and \ndiseases, etc.\nThe prediction of crop yields has been\
    \ the subject of many studies. Ref. [71] presented \na literature review on crop\
    \ forecasting, where the authors highlighted the most used \nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms along with the applied metrics and measures. In this sec-\ntion,\
    \ we examine the learning algorithms that have been used in crop yield prediction\
    \ \nfrom different views: data types, the pre-processing methods, and features\
    \ or the predic-\ntor variables used in each study. Tables  2 and  3 summarise\
    \ some relevant studies.\nThe crop yield forecasting approaches follow two major\
    \ types of sources of data. The \nfirst type is related to the sources that have\
    \ direct impact on the crops. These sources are \nsoil data, weather data, environmental\
    \ parameter data. These are usually used to predict \ncrop yield [27, 34, 42,\
    \ 46, 51, 73]. The second type of sources are the use of advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and tools like satellite multi/hyper spectral images, remote sensing and \n\
    sensors to collect the data [62, 83, 102, 114, 152]. Some advanced studies use\
    \ both types \nof data sources [1, 40, 54, 59, 65, 67, 68, 97, 120, 121].\nThe\
    \ forecasting models based on the first type of data sources provides a pre-season\
    \ \nestimation of the yield, even before the beginning of the crop season. This\
    \ allows farmers \nto decide which strategy to both optimise the farming operations\
    \ and crop production. \nThese decisions include choosing seeds and crop type,\
    \ type of fertiliser and its applica-\ntions. Moreover, This data can also be\
    \ used for some crop monitoring during the grow-\ning season.\nThe monitoring\
    \ systems based on the second type of data analysis - data imagery \nobtained\
    \ from satellite, cameras, scanner, sensors - allow for on-season estimation \n\
    (emergence, detect stress conditions of crop, harvest dates, ...). These models\
    \ are com-\nplex since they have to analyse the data that consists of both spatio-temporal\
    \ and non-\nspacial. While the spatial data is of high resolution, some images\
    \ can be of very poor \nPage 11 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data\

    \ as a major menace for food security in many regions of the \nworld since it\
    \ causes serious crops losses. While the detection of crop diseases correctly\
    \ \nand timely when they first appear is crucial in crop monitoring, this remains\
    \ a difficult \ntask. One of the solutions to deal with this issue is to use data\
    \ analytics approach. This \nwill reduce yield losses and prevent farmers to take\
    \ effective reactive actions. Forewarn-\ning can be seen as the outputs of data\
    \ mining process. Usually, this consists of examining \nthe features of a newly\
    \ presented case and assigning it to a predefined class.\nSeveral interesting\
    \ efforts have been developed to prevent crops losses due to dis-\neases, Tables\
    \  4 and 5 summarise some major studies. Ref. [7] presented an overview of \n\
    ML techniques for crop disease classification. In addition, it presented to a\
    \ case study \nwhere a deep learning algorithm was successfully used. Ref. [45]\
    \ provided a review on \nadvanced ANN techniques to process hyper-spectral data\
    \ for plant disease detection. \nRecently, deep learning approaches have been\
    \ emerged and widely used for plant dis-\nease detection and classification, with\
    \ a variety of network architectures (CNN, AlexNet, \ngoogLeNet, CaffeNet, DenseNet,\
    \ Inception, LeNet, VGGNet,...) and training methods \n(shallow, deep, from scratch)\
    \ [9, 16, 21, 28, 38, 63, 79, 82, 125, 139, 143, 150, 155]. More-\nover, [127]\
    \ presented an interesting study on the potential of the use of deep learning\
    \ for \nplant stress phenotyping.\nCrop protection, that consists of disease,\
    \ stress, and weed detection, aims to offer tools \nthat detect plants disease\
    \ caused by various biotic (pathogen, insect, pest, and weed) \nor abiotic (temperature\
    \ stress, nutrient deficiency, toxicity, herbicide) variables [126]. \nThe earlier\
    \ the stress, disease or their symptoms are detected, the greater the chance of\
    \ \nreducing the disease spread within a field. This has gained significant advantage\
    \ from the \nadvances in image collection and processing and their analysis using\
    \ ML algorithm. The \nstate-of-the-art is very rich. The large majority of studies\
    \ carried out so far were using \nimage processing, consequently image-based data\
    \ and classification techniques. These \nare capable of detecting disease at the\
    \ scale of leaf, canopy or field [126].\nDisease detection at a leaf level uses\
    \ images collected using digital cameras, which are \nstored in data warehouses.\
    \ For instance, PlantVillage database [6, 9, 21, 28, 63, 79, 88, \n106, 125, 129,\
    \ 150] is created for this purpose. The objective of this repository is to build\
    \ \nclassifiers with high accuracy. The basic classifiers can simply assign to\
    \ an unseen image \na label healthy or infected, while more elaborated classifiers\
    \ can identify the disease - in \nother words, classify unseen images to disease\
    \ classes. However, this approach has some \nlimitations. First, it depends on\
    \ the quality of the images, as when taken in natural envi-\nronment, these images\
    \ are subject to different degrees of light, shadow, dust and leaves \noverlapping\
    \ and requires sophisticated image processing, which is not an easy task. Sec-\n\
    ond, usually the datasets sizes are small, which affect the learning phase of\
    \ the classifiers \nPage 16 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \

    \ potential of some advanced learning algorithms such as deep \nlearning. Data\
    \ augmentation (rotation, light shade’s variation, colour inversion, transla-\n\
    tion and changes in intensity and so on) is one of the methods used to overcome\
    \ this \nproblem to artificially increase the number of images [6, 9, 21, 63,\
    \ 79, 129, 150], but it \ndoes not always work. Transfer learning is another solution\
    \ to scarce/small data-set, \nwhere the knowledge obtained from solving a task\
    \ in a given domain is transferred to \nthe target domain in which the dataset\
    \ is small [6, 11, 28]. The transfer learning can only \nbe efficient if the source\
    \ and target domains share some similarities in terms of diseases \nand their\
    \ symptoms, for example. Moreover, it is very challenging to transfer knowledge\
    \ \nfrom representations learned using RGB images to a target task using multi-spectral\
    \ \nimages from UAV or satellite [126].\nThird, this approach cannot detect more\
    \ than a single disease at a time, and the detec-\ntion of diseases if the symptoms\
    \ are manifested in another area than leaves. Plant can-\nopy based-image was\
    \ proposed as a solution to this problem. The idea is to collect data \nrelative\
    \ to disease in situations where single-leaf phenotypes alone would not provide\
    \ \nsufficient information. Such features include the size, the height, the structure,\
    \ and \nbranching of canopy [126]. The canopy-based detection uses UAV equipped\
    \ with (multi/ \nhyper) spectral cameras and sensors to collect the data [32,\
    \ 49, 80, 82, 136, 143, 153, \n155]. Then data needs to be processed to extract\
    \ features which are usually related to \nvegetation indices like NDVI and EVI\
    \ or colours like RGB and NIR. The benefit from \nUAV images comes with cost on\
    \ complexity of analysis since images taken by UAV are \nsusceptible to occlusion,\
    \ overlapping, and atmospheric effects. Also, UAV is not able \nto fly at higher\
    \ altitudes, which decreases the quality of the collected images. To cover \n\
    larger zones and fields, satellite-based remote sensing and images has been proposed\
    \ as \na very good alternative [15, 81, 109, 156]. However, the problem with satellite\
    \ remote \nsensing is the revisit time, which is 16 days on average, which makes\
    \ protection applica-\ntions difficult, and some diseases can spread rapidly in\
    \ fields before they are detected. \nMoreover, passive sensors cannot penetrate\
    \ clouds [149]. The integration of these data \nwith additional data sources like\
    \ field surveys, contextual information of field and crop \nrotation can improve\
    \ the accuracy [15, 81, 109].\nDetecting diseases only from one data source based\
    \ on digital images or sensor data is \nnot sufficient. Besides, variations in\
    \ symptoms may lead to false positives due to dynamic \nnature of plant changes\
    \ [126]. Consequently, the appearance-based identification of dis-\neases is not\
    \ reliable enough to accurately detect unhealthy plants, especially in the early\
    \ \ngrowth stages. The use of multi-data sources can improve the accuracy of the\
    \ detection. \nFor instance, the use of physiological features and morphological\
    \ characteristics (growth \nattributes, yield-related features, soil) [66], or\
    \ the employment of satellite-based images \nand canopy-based images [156], where\
    \ the disease can be identified at the plant canopy \nlevel and at the field level.\n\
    Crop maturity monitoring\nCrop maturity is a kind of crop yield prediction, but\
    \ it is based on image data. This tech-\nnique has been used in fruit detection,\
    \ like apples, tomatoes, oranges, etc, and provides \nan early estimation of yield.\
    \ It is also used for crop monitoring to provide information \nto farmers with\
    \ the view to plan their farming operations, adjust management practices \nPage\
    \ 21 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n\
    \ \nbefore harvesting, etc. Such intelligent systems for monitoring crop implement\
    \ the data \nmining process incorporating machine vision and image processing\
    \ methods among \nwith advanced learning algorithms, such as CNN, SVM and ANN.\
    \ Unlike crop yield \nprediction process described above, this process is based\
    \ on a single-data source; digital \nimages [5, 23, 52, 75, 108, 122] or sensor\
    \ based-images [117, 123, 153]. Table  6 summa-\nrises such techniques. The challenges\
    \ of these systems are more or less the same as those \nof systems for crop disease\
    \ detection and protection. For instance, images with differ-\nent illumination\
    \ and lighting angles, complex surroundings and backgrounds, noise, the \npresence\
    \ of clouds, etc.\nClustering for crop monitoring\nClustering techniques are not\
    \ widely employed in DA, few efforts have been deployed to \ninvestigate the potential\
    \ of these techniques for zones’ delineation within a field. There \nare several\
    \ reasons for splitting an agricultural field into zones. Some traditional reasons\
    \ \ninclude crop diversification within a field, crop-rotation, facilitating the\
    \ management \ntasks, and more recently we defined the zones based on yield maps.\
    \ This usually helps \nto improve the overall crop yield of the field, by managing\
    \ the zones more effectively. \nTherefore, delineation of Management zones (DMZ)\
    \ is a very important task for farming \noperations since determining zones of\
    \ low-or-high yields, and understanding the rea-\nsons behind low yields, can\
    \ help come up with specific solution for each zone with the \nview to increase\
    \ the yields. In addition, it has other economic benefits, because we can \ntarget\
    \ each zone with the right amount of fertilisers, water, and other nutrients.\n\
    According to [69], delineation of management zones is an effective way to manage\
    \ the \nvariability of soil within a field, such that each zone will receive specific\
    \ management. In \n[145], a management zone is defined as a subregion of a field\
    \ that has a relatively homo-\ngeneous combination of yield-limiting factors,\
    \ for which a single rate of a specific crop \ninput is appropriate to reach maximum\
    \ efficiency of farm inputs. In [53], it is defined as \na subregion of a field\
    \ that is relatively homogeneous with regard to soil attributes.\nDMZ is a complex\
    \ spatial problem, which is addressed in the literature from several \nperspectives.\
    \ This has attracted interest from many researchers [61, 85, 87, 110, 140]. A\
    \ \nliterature review has been presented in [90], where the authors discussed\
    \ the delineation \nof soil management zones from the variable-rate fertilisation\
    \ point of view. many other \nstudies presented the delineation based on various\
    \ criteria. Some techniques that have \nbeen used include topographic maps, direct\
    \ soil sampling, non-invasive soil sampling by \nelectrical conductivity equipment,\
    \ soil organic matter or organic estimated by remote \nsensing, and yield maps\
    \ built using data collected over several seasons/years [99].\nFigure  6 depicts\
    \ the general process of delineation of management zones designed \naccording\
    \ to methodologies followed by the majority of the literature.\nThe majority of\
    \ problems that are related to crop management imply the management \nof fields\
    \ and zones. Therefore, the collected data is usually characterised by geographic\
    \ \ncoordinates and time associated with each sample, which leads to the use of\
    \ data min-\ning techniques that are more suitable for spatial and temporal datasets.\
    \ It is well rec-\nognised that agricultural datasets are typically spatio-temporal,\
    \ as the data is always \nassociated with location and time. However, these datasets\
    \ contain a significant amount \nof noise, outliers, and even missing values.\

    \ noise, imprecisions, and even outliers in the data. Satellite imagery also faces\
    \ huge \nimprecision and noise (such as clouds, ...).\nBecause of the type of\
    \ the datasets, which is spatio-temporal, it is not surprising \nto notice that\
    \ the majority of the clustering algorithms used are of type partitional. \nK-means\
    \ and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) are considered among the most popular clustering \ntechniques\
    \ and heavily used to cluster agricultural data [17, 18, 84, 134, 137, 142, 151,\
    \ \n154]. The FCM approach has an advantage over K-means, as it deals better with\
    \ impre-\ncision and noisy data. Moreover, other types of clustering algorithms\
    \ have also been \nproven to be efficient in DA, such as density-based and hierarchical-based\
    \ clustering \ntechniques applied to DMZ [48, 116].\nAs mentioned above, besides\
    \ its huge importance in crop management, delineation \nof management zone (DMZ)\
    \ has received much attention, as the data is now available \nnot only from traditional\
    \ sources but also from refined sources, including advanced data \npre-processing\
    \ techniques. In addition, the recently collected data integrates knowledge \n\
    of experts and farmers experiences on their fields, which improves significantly\
    \ the qual-\nity of the data [84, 141]. Advanced imaging enhancement techniques\
    \ improve further \nthe data quality, and they offer the ability to track the\
    \ development of crops and provide \na Geo-referenced data that can describe the\
    \ spatial and the temporal variability of soil \nand crops variables at high resolution,\
    \ covering large areas [17, 84, 101, 132, 133, 141, \n151].\nSystematic analysis\n\
    In the following we will explore the application of data analytics in DA and its\
    \ extension \nto big data, and illustrate the practical challenges that hinder\
    \ the full adoption of DA by \nfarmers.\nDA in (small /large) scale farming\n\
    Farming can be carried out on a small or large-scale fields depending on several\
    \ fac-\ntors like land size, capital, farmer skills, level of use of machinery\
    \ and technology, etc. \nAccording to FAO3 and Grain4, over 90% of all farms worldwide\
    \ are of small-scale hold-\ning on average 2.2 hectares (from 0.6 to 10 hectares),\
    \ except for Northern America \nwhere small farms have an average size of 67.7\
    \ hectares5. Small-scale farms represent \n25% of the world’s farmland today,\
    \ where 73.12% are located in developing countries.\nFig. 6 The delineation management\
    \ zones process\n3 http:// faost at3. fao. org/ faost at- gatew ay/ go/ to/ home/.\n\
    4 https:// grain. org.\n5 According to the criterion put forward by Lincoln University\
    \ in Nebraska, which defines a small farm in the US as one \nwith an annual turnover\
    \ of less than US$50,000)\nPage 24 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big\
    \ Data           (2022) 9:123 \nIn [10] the authors described three categories\
    \ of smart farming technology, which are \ncomplementary:\n• Data acquisition\
    \ technologies: they are used to acquire the data that is related to the \nfarm.\
    \ These include remote sensing, weather data, etc.;\n• Data analysis and evaluation\
    \ technologies: these technologies usually take as input \nthe data that has been\
    \ collected so far and deliver insight to the farmer. These include \ncomputer-based\
    \ visualisation and decision models, farm management and informa-\ntion systems;\n\
    • Precision application technologies: these are focusing on variable-rate application\
    \ \nand guidance technologies.\nThe application of smart technologies and data\
    \ analytics for crop management are not \nrestricted to one kind of farm. Nowadays,\
    \ every farm should adopt smart technologies, \nas they are needed for variable\
    \ rates applications (irrigation, pesticides, fertilisers) [72, \n102, 154] while\
    \ protecting the environment.\nThe size of the farm determines how these technologies\
    \ will be used. Large farms tend \nto develop their smart technology to monitor\
    \ their farming land, or to afford some of the \nexisting sophisticated systems\
    \ like CropX as they hold the scale and margins. While small \nfarms tend to rent\
    \ sophisticated machinery and smart applications on demand, especially \nwith\
    \ the proliferation of cloud technologies that makes these smart applications\
    \ reason-\nable, the work of [30] is an example among others, of a smart irrigation\
    \ system designed \nfor smallholders. Besides, some technologies are more suitable\
    \ for large-scale farms like \ndrones and aerial vehicles used to monitor crops\
    \ which are not as profitable or efficient \nfor small scales because they have\
    \ less difficulty visualising their crops. On the other side, \nlarge-scale farms\
    \ are responsible for 70% of current deforestation6, the largest share of \nagriculture-related\
    \ greenhouse-gazes emissions, agricultural water use and habitat disrup-\ntion\
    \ resulting in biodiversity loss. Generally, small-scale farms require considerably\
    \ fewer \nexternal inputs and cause minor damage to the environment.\nTable  7\
    \ summarises the main differences between small and large-scale farming from \n\
    several perspectives. However, DA can be applied to any kind of farm without restric-\n\
    tion. Yet, we have found that the number of papers that addressed large-scale\
    \ farms is \nalmost the same as works on large-scale farms.\nTechnologies for\
    \ data acquisition Table  7 can be used to all types of farms, such as \nremote\
    \ sensing, imagery data systems, and so on. The acquired data, over the years,\
    \ can \nlead to the phenomenon of Big Data. If pre-processed and stored properly,\
    \ this will give \na significant competitive advantage to farms that collected\
    \ them, whether they are small \nor large. Some of the applications and data analyses\
    \ that can be performed of the col-\nlected are summarised in the Tables  1,  2,\
    \  3, 4 and  5,  6.\nDA and big data\nBig data is not just characterised by the\

    \ techniques to deal with large volumes of data (volume), various types of data\
    \ \nattributes (variety or heterogeneity), and be able to analyse the new data\
    \ as soon as it \nis collected (velocity) are extremely challenging tasks. Moreover,\
    \ many other character-\nistics can be found in some big data-driven applications,\
    \ these include veracity, value, \nviscosity, veracity, visualisation, etc. In\
    \ this study, we added veracity, as the data, col-\nlected by various instruments\
    \ and sensors, is of different quality, which creates a huge \nchallenge to the\
    \ data pre-processing task, and therefore its analysis. In the following, we \n\
    discuss the impact of Big Data challenges on DA.\n• Velocity: many studies that\
    \ have been examined do not consider the data velocity \nduring their data collection.\
    \ In DA, the frequency of collecting data depends on its \nsource and the problem\
    \ for which the data was collected. Some applications need \nreal-time data and\
    \ others do not. For instance, crop yield prediction does not need \nreal-time\
    \ data or data streams. It is performed at ad-hoc, while crop protection and \n\
    disease detection require high quality sensors and imagery data connected to effi-\n\
    cient methods of data analysis, which need continuous control.\n• Variety: this\
    \ is very common in agricultural datasets, as multiple sources were used \nto\
    \ collect all the necessary information about the farm and farming operations.\
    \ The \ndata values can be a simple number such as temperatures to more elaborated\
    \ such as \nimagery data, NDVI, soil texture, etc. This makes the definition of\
    \ distance measures \nand other parameters of the learning algorithms very difficult.\n\
    • Veracity: Agricultural data contains many missing values and collected from\
    \ various \nsources of varying quality. The data is very noisy, and more importantly\
    \ it contains \nmany missing values. Therefore, it is very challenging to clean\
    \ and prepare it for the \nanalysis. This was the case in the work conducted by\
    \ [37], and also in [93–96, 107] \nwhere data was collected from very large farming\
    \ areas.\nTable  8, summarises a set of representative papers reported in the\
    \ paper according to \ntheir usage of big data. For each paper, we identify the\
    \ type, the size, the heterogeneity \nof data used, and the frequency of its collection.\
    \ Also, we consider the number and type \nof ML algorithms used, the complexity\
    \ of the proposed analysis algorithms and devices \nused to collect data, data\
    \ analysis applied to a given crop and problem to solve. One \ncan notice while\
    \ the data analysis algorithms and techniques were heavily used and var-\nied,\
    \ the rigorous process of knowledge discovery was not followed, usually the data\
    \ is \nrelatively small either in size (small observations) or the data has few\
    \ dimensions (for \ninstance, considering only weather data, or fertiliser, without\
    \ taking into account other \nfactors).\nFrom Table  8, we can extract three classes\
    \ of applications according to their usage of \nbig data: Full usage (the data\
    \ contains all the characteristics of big data), light usage (the \ndata contains\
    \ some characteristics), non-usage (the data does not contain any character-\n\
    istic of big data).\nTo examine the degree of use of the big data concept and\
    \ to figure out which of its \ndimension is more present, we conducted a statistical\
    \ study where we classify works \naccording to their employment of the 4Vs of\
    \ big data.\nPage 27 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data         \

    \  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nFigures  7 and  8 show that\
    \ no work has a full employment of big data (4Vs). One can \nnotice that the agricultural\
    \ data is multidimensional and heterogeneous (variety). More-\nover, we have found\
    \ that the prediction applications display more use of big data, there \nexist\
    \ studies that have used three dimensions such as DMZ applications. It is worth\
    \ not-\ning that these applications, either prediction or delineation of zones,\
    \ have the potential \nto use big data to provide stable and accurate results.\n\
    If we put aside the volume dimension (V1) (see Figure  7, only 7% of the reviewed\
    \ \nstudies used (V2, V3 and V4), and 32% of studies just employed data mining\
    \ techniques \nfor agriculture problems. The most employed data mining techniques\
    \ are for prediction, \nincluding yield prediction, forecasting, prediction of\
    \ fertiliser applications, etc.\nDA practical challenges\nThere exist a number\
    \ of challenges and obstacles impeding the potential benefit of DA. \nIn [104],\
    \ the authors studied the barriers that prevent the adoption of smart farming\
    \ \nin their country, Brazil. Some of these barriers include lack of integration\
    \ and compat-\nibility between different agriculture systems, lack of advanced\
    \ data manipulation of data \nobtained from different equipment, poor telecommunications\
    \ infrastructure on rural \nareas, and finally, the lack of training in deploying\
    \ and using new technologies. These \nbarriers are common to the majority of countries\
    \ in the world.\nFig. 7 Distribution of works according to the used Big Data dimensions’\n\
    Fig. 8 Percent of employment of big data dimensions\nPage 30 of 37\nChergui and\
    \ Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nFrom the Table  7, we\
    \ can see that over 73% of crop farms are located in developing \ncountries. So\
    \ that, the investment in high and sophisticated DA technologies is not \nthere.\
    \ Most of the main technologies used in DA systems (GPS, UAV, auto-steering and\
    \ \nvariable rate technology) are designed for relatively large-scale farms located\
    \ in devel-\noped countries [10] or designed by developed countries. Some of these\
    \ technologies are \nbecoming available recently. For instance, since 2018 African\
    \ scientists can have access \nto free and open-source satellite data as a result\
    \ of a deal signed by the African Union \nwith the European Commission’s Copernicus\
    \ programme.\nAs DA is relatively new technology, there is a lack of standards\
    \ and common solutions \nfor data collection, preparation and storage. In addition,\
    \ there is a lack of data for many \nreasons, farmers did not record their data\
    \ and it takes time to build significant historical \ndatasets [20, 39, 77, 78,\
    \ 92, 146]. Another major barrier is that many farmers are relying \nmore on their\
    \ expertise and refusing to adopt these new and complex technologies [10]. \n\
    Moreover, the transition from their traditional practices and farming habits to\
    \ these \ntechnologies comes with a cost and energy (training and learning new\
    \ skills).\n[20] States that the legal and regulatory frameworks around the collection,\
    \ sharing and \nuse of agricultural data contributes to a range of challenges.\
    \ Many laws potentially influ-\nence the ownership, control of and data access.\
    \ Ref. [74] presented a set of socio-ethical \nimperatives associated with the\
    \ use of data in agriculture, including dependency risks, \ndata concentration,\
    \ potential lock-in effects, and the peril of transformation of farmers \ninto\
    \ information tools, in addition to the sustainability challenges.\nFinally, according\
    \ to [47], the real economic value of the use of big data in farming is \nstill\
    \ unknown, especially for small-scale farming. Consequently, it will be hard to\
    \ con-\nvince them to switch from process-driven towards data and machine learning\
    \ driven. \nThis is reaffirmed in [20], where the authors stated that on one side,\
    \ farmers are enticed \nwith promises of increased profits and farming efficiency,\
    \ on the other hand the proofs \nare not there yet.\nConclusion\nDigital agriculture\
    \ (DA) is a data-driven approach that exploits the hidden information \nwithin\
    \ the collected data to gain new insights; transforming the farming practices\
    \ from \nintuitive-based decision-making to informed-based decision-making. DA\
    \ relies on effi-\ncient data collection practices, efficient data preparation\
    \ and storage techniques, effi-\ncient data analytics, and efficient deployment\
    \ and exploitation of the gained insights to \nmake optimal farming decisions.\n\
    In this study, we presented a systematic review of the potential use of the data\
    \ mining \nprocess in crop production and management and highlighted serious gaps\
    \ which can be \nconsidered in future studies. The majority of the current practices\
    \ were dominated by \nstatistical analyses and small machine learning systems.\
    \ However, these can only give \nsome ideas within a very limited view of the\
    \ overall system. Agricultural data-driven \napplications collect a significant\
    \ amount of data from various sources. This constitutes \nan excellent opportunity\
    \ to the field to answer numerous research and practical ques-\ntions that were\
    \ not possible before. Nevertheless, despite all the advantages that can \nbe\
    \ gained from DA, there are several other challenges and obstacles that need to\
    \ be \nPage 31 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022)\
    \ 9:123 \n \naddressed, among them lack of data, lack of skills, and lack of maturity\
    \ and standards so \nthat it can be adopted and deployed quickly and easily.\n\
    In this study, we cover approaches that deal the entire process of data mining;\
    \ from \ndata collection to knowledge deployment. We cover this process from big\
    \ data view, \nwith more focus on crop monitoring and management in an attempt\
    \ to understand the \nchallenges that DA is currently facing. We defined the research\
    \ questions addressed by \nthe study and provided a classification of data mining\
    \ techniques used in the field. For \neach class, a set of representative existing\
    \ works have been reviewed, and an analytical \nstudy has been provided to highlight\
    \ the category of machine learning method applied \nand for which purpose. We\
    \ discussed the big data concepts and its current impact on \nDA, and showed that\
    \ from the data analyst’s view, the transition towards DA is ready \nto embrace\
    \ big data analytics concepts. This provides new opportunities of investment \n\
    into these challenges and allows for a efficient ways of managing crops. Besides,\
    \ it will \nprovide farmers with new insights into how they can grow crops more\
    \ efficiently, while \nminimising the impact on the environment. It also promises\
    \ new levels of scientific dis-\ncovery and innovative solutions to more complex\
    \ problems.\nAbbreviations\nANN \n Artificial Neural Network\nBC \n Bayesian classifier\n\

    Abstract: In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies,\
    \ have been\nprogressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These\
    \ and other digitalization-enabling\ntechnologies are generating a massive amount\
    \ of data with enormous potential to manage supply\nchains more efﬁciently and\
    \ sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded\n\
    in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis.\
    \ In such a data-\ndriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved\
    \ signiﬁcant momentum to analyze, mine,\nand extract the underlying data information,\
    \ or solve complex optimization problems, striking a\nbalance between productive\
    \ efﬁciency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some\nrecent studies\
    \ have sorted the CI literature in this ﬁeld, they are mainly oriented towards\
    \ a single\nfamily of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics)\
    \ and review their\napplication in speciﬁc FSC stages. As such, there is a gap\
    \ in identifying and classifying FSC problems\nfrom a broader perspective, encompassing\
    \ the various families of CI methods that can be applied in\ndifferent stages\
    \ (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these\
    \ stages\nfrom a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\n(associated with agriculture, ﬁsh farming, and livestock) from\
    \ a CI approach; that is, it deﬁnes FSC\nproblems (from production to retail)\
    \ and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from\na CI point of view.\
    \ Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in\neach\
    \ stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also\
    \ introduce a set of\nguidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to\
    \ decide on suitable families of methods when\naddressing any particular problems\
    \ they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy,\nwe identify\
    \ and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should\
    \ explore to\nenhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nKeywords: food supply chain; computational intelligence; fish farming;\
    \ agriculture; livestock; machine\nlearning; neural networks; deep learning; meta-heuristics;\
    \ fuzzy systems; probabilistic methods\n1. Introduction\nCurrently, one worldwide\
    \ challenge is how to sustainably guarantee global food needs\nin the face of\
    \ a growing population that is projected to be 9–10 billion by 2050 [1]. In this\n\
    sense, the enhancement of production and management of the current Food Supply\
    \ Chains\n(FSCs) is a crucial factor that contributes to accomplishing such an\
    \ aim. Nowadays, new\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) (e.g.,\
    \ the Internet of Things) play\nan active role in the digitization of FSCs [2].\
    \ As a result, large volumes of data are being\ngenerated in all FSC stages, ranging\
    \ from production to retail. The analysis of such data\nwould enable FSC actors\
    \ to extract relevant information or to optimize speciﬁc processes,\nallowing\
    \ improvement of the FSC administration, productivity, and sustainability.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the high volumes of available data and their complex patterns raise\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ challenges when analyzing and extracting values. In this context, Computational\n\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n2 of 34\nIntelligence (CI) seems to be a successful paradigm\
    \ to build intelligent systems that are\nable to leverage this high availability\
    \ of data. CI is the ability of a digital system or\nalgorithm to perform tasks\
    \ commonly associated with intelligent beings [3]. Within such\ntasks, we can\
    \ ﬁnd speech recognition, visual perception, decision-making, prediction, and\n\
    translation, among others [4]. Over the last few years, the number of academic\
    \ publications\nconcerning CI applied to FSC has rapidly increased [5–7]. Within\
    \ the most representative\nCI methods applied to FSCs, we ﬁnd Neural Networks,\
    \ Fuzzy Logic, Swarm Intelligence,\nor Probabilistic Reasoning.\nThe scientiﬁc\
    \ literature reports different studies that aim to review and order the\napplication\
    \ of CI methods in different FSC stages. The variety of CI methods has led to\
    \ the\nemergence of research papers (published between 2012 and 2020), which select\
    \ a partic-\nular family of CI techniques and review their application in speciﬁc\
    \ FSC stages [2,6–12].\nHowever, these papers focus on only one or two families\
    \ of CI methods at most, and in the\nmajority of cases, do not cover all FSC stages.\
    \ Therefore, there is a lack of comprehensive\nstudies that review the application\
    \ of the most important families of CI methods in all FSC\nstages (from production\
    \ to retail). Additionally, few efforts have been made to classify FSC\nproblems\
    \ from a CI perspective. Hence, there is no categorization of the typologies of\
    \ FSC\nproblems to help determine how they can be modeled from a CI view (e.g.,\
    \ optimization,\nuncertain knowledge handling, reasoning) and what CI methods\
    \ can be most suitably used\nto approach them. Thus, despite the progress made\
    \ in organizing and systematizing the\nexisting literature at the point where\
    \ CI and FSCs meet, to the best of our knowledge, no\ntaxonomy has been proposed\
    \ in this regard.\nWith the above-mentioned ideas in mind, we propose a novel\
    \ taxonomy of FSC\nproblems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the\
    \ supply chain of agriculture,\nﬁsh farming, and livestock. The latter is justiﬁed\
    \ based on the fact that these supply chains\nprovide most of the food consumed\
    \ by the population of the world [13] and, therefore, they\nare the most studied\
    \ and researched FSCs in the scientiﬁc and academic literature. The\nmain contributions\
    \ of this article are:\n•\nA new taxonomy that provides a comprehensive view of\
    \ different FSC problems\nlocated in the chain stages typically studied in the\
    \ scientiﬁc literature (production,\nprocessing, distribution, and retail). This\
    \ taxonomy represents a new and broader\nproposal in order to identify and deﬁne\
    \ FSC problems that have been approached\nusing CI in the four aforementioned\
    \ stages. Besides, although some research articles\nhave described diverse FSC\
    \ problems, their deﬁnitions are not uniﬁed and vary\nfrom one paper to another.\
    \ Thus, this taxonomy also represents an effort to unify\nand consolidate deﬁnitions\
    \ of the FSC problems available in the literature, which\nrepresents a valuable\
    \ source of information for FSC researchers and practitioners\nworking in this\
    \ domain.\n•\nTo classify the FSC problems from a CI perspective. This classiﬁcation\
    \ allows FSC\nproblems to be mapped into common categories of problems in the\
    \ CI domain. Thus,\nwe provide a framework that helps display the similarities\
    \ and differences among\nFSC problems depending on how they can be modeled under\
    \ a CI perspective. To the\nbest of our knowledge, in this regard, no classiﬁcation\
    \ has been previously proposed.\n•\nTo establish a set of guidelines for the use\
    \ of CI in the FSC ﬁeld. These guidelines\naim to help FSC researchers and practitioners\
    \ to identify which FSC problems can\nbe addressed using CI, and the most appropriate\
    \ families of techniques to solve\nthem. Thus, these guidelines represent a ﬁrst\
    \ attempt to deﬁne a general framework\nto support the model selection problem\
    \ at the point where the ﬁelds of FSC and\nCI converge.\n•\nTo identify and discuss\
    \ challenges and research opportunities in the FSC domain,\nwhich are directed\
    \ towards more robust, explainable, interoperable, and accurate CI\nsolutions\
    \ that support FSC management and operation.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 provides background in-\nformation on FSC and CI to facilitate\
    \ the understanding of the article. Furthermore, it\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n\
    3 of 34\nsummarizes other efforts directed at reviewing and categorizing the scientiﬁc\
    \ literature at\nthe point where FSC and CI meet in order to highlight how this\
    \ paper complements and\nenhances previous studies. Section 3 presents the proposed\
    \ taxonomy, its structure, and the\nclassiﬁcation of FSC from a CI perspective.\
    \ Afterwards, Section 4 gives FSC researchers and\npractitioners a set of guidelines\
    \ for the use of CI within the FSC domain. Lastly, Section 5\nsummarizes the main\
    \ conclusions and sets a research agenda for CI in the FSC ﬁeld.\n2. Background\
    \ and Motivation\nThis section provides some contextual and relevant background\
    \ information to facili-\ntate the understanding of the paper, and to assess similar\
    \ studies in this area. We start by\nintroducing the basic FSC stages examined\
    \ in this study (Section 2.1). Then, Section 2.2\npresents the main families of\
    \ CI approaches typically considered in FSC research. Finally,\nSection 2.3 reviews\
    \ similar works at the point where FSC and CI converge, which have\nidentiﬁed\
    \ and classiﬁed CI-based problems and methods. Section 2 ends with a discussion\n\
    of the main contributions of this research article.\n2.1. Food Supply Chain\n\
    FSC refers to the system that encompasses all activities, organizations, actors,\
    \ tech-\nnologies, information, resources, and services involved in producing\
    \ agri-food products for\nconsumer markets (e.g., fresh food, meat, and processed\
    \ food products) [14]. The upstream\nand downstream sectors form the supply of\
    \ agricultural inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers,\nfeed, medicine, or equipment)\
    \ to production, post-harvest handling, processing, transporta-\ntion, marketing,\
    \ distribution, and retailing [15]. They also include support services such as\n\
    extension services, research and development, and market information.\nBefore\
    \ the ﬁnal consumption of food products, FSC can include diverse stages wherein\n\
    production, processing, distribution, and retail are the stages most commonly\
    \ studied in\nthe scientiﬁc literature [16]. First, the production stage forms\
    \ the initial set of processes to\nobtain raw products derived from agriculture,\
    \ ﬁsh farming, or livestock. Agriculture refers\nto farming applications, including\
    \ the cultivation of soils for the harvest of crops [17]. Fish\nfarming involves\
    \ raising ﬁsh commercially in tanks or ﬁsh ponds, usually for consumer\nmarkets\
    \ [18]. Meanwhile, livestock is devoted to practices related to animal husbandry\
    \ for\nmeat, milk, eggs, or wool [19]. Continuing further down the production\
    \ chain, we ﬁnd\nthe processing stage, wherein the produced raw materials are\
    \ exposed to diverse transfor-\nmation processes (e.g., meat curing, washing and\
    \ disinfecting vegetables, fermentation),\nwhich allow consumable food products\
    \ to be obtained.\nOnce food products are ready to be delivered to the end-users,\
    \ the following FSC\nstages are distribution and retail. Their main purpose is\
    \ to connect the production and\nprocessing stages with the food users to complete\
    \ the supply chain loop [16]. Consequently,\nin the distribution stage, the processed\
    \ food is sent to distribution centers and warehouses.\nFrom such locations, different\
    \ distribution channels start to deliver the products to retail\nstores for sale.\
    \ Thus, retail is the end stage of the FSC and represents the link to consumers.\n\
    FSCs consist of a wide range of enterprises, ranging from smallholders, farmers’\n\
    organizations, co-operatives, and start-up companies to multinational enterprises\
    \ through\nparent companies or their local afﬁliates [14,15]. In this context,\
    \ FSC companies relate\nto each other through a variety of arrangements. Downstream\
    \ companies in the supply\nchain may engage in various types of relationships\
    \ with producers to secure access to\nagricultural products. They can impose standards\
    \ and speciﬁcations on producers with\nlittle involvement beyond a buying contract.\
    \ However, they can also become more actively\ninvolved, particularly through\
    \ contract farming, to coordinate production and ensure\nquality and safety [14].\
    \ In the new circular chain schemes, this type of relationship becomes\nmore complex,\
    \ involving more than one enterprise from the chain in the decision-making\nprocess\
    \ [20].\nCurrently, an appropriate and effective strategy to address this challenge\
    \ is the digiti-\nzation of FSCs, both of their internal processes and of their\
    \ relationships with other actors\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n4 of 34\nin the chain\
    \ [2]. Digitization has led to the generation of big volumes of data throughout\
    \ the\nentire supply chain. The exploitation of such data would allow FSC actors\
    \ to extract knowl-\nedge that could improve their internal processes in terms\
    \ of productivity and sustainability,\nas well as that of the FSC as a whole.\
    \ However, the data obtained through digitization\nusually contain complex and\
    \ intricate patterns that stand out as diverse challenges for\nprocessing and\
    \ analysis to extract value from it. Thus, CI arises as a solution that could\n\
    leverage and mine the underlying patterns of such data in order to obtain the\
    \ maximum\nvalue of the information, according to the analyses made.\n2.2. Computational\
    \ Intelligence Approaches\nCI is centered on the ability of a computer or algorithm\
    \ to learn speciﬁc tasks (e.g.,\npattern recognition, forecasting) from data that\
    \ is typically related to experimental observa-\ntions without human intervention\
    \ [3]. In the context of FSC, diverse IoT devices and data\nmanagement systems\
    \ sense and gather such data, which they then deploy in each supply\nchain stage.\
    \ After obtaining data, different CI approaches are used to process, analyze,\
    \ and\nextract information. In this section, we introduce the relevant background\
    \ information in\nrelation to families of CI-based methods that are typically\
    \ used in FSC applications. Fol-\nlowing the guidelines and classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in [3], we have grouped the CI methods\ninto ﬁve families that are presented\
    \ in more detail below. They are CI-based Statistical\nLearning Methods, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks and Deep Learning, CI-based Optimization\nMethods, Fuzzy Systems,\
    \ and Probabilistic Reasoning. These groups of CI-based methods\nare presented\
    \ below.\n2.2.1. CI-Based Statistical Learning Methods\nStatistical Learning Methods,\
    \ also known as Machine Learning (ML) methods are\nalgorithms that are able to\
    \ learn a speciﬁc task without being explicitly programmed. More\nformally, according\
    \ to Mitchell [21], these types of methods learn from experiences E,\nrelated\
    \ to a task T, and their performance is evaluated by a metric P. The performance\
    \ in T\nimproves according to P, with experience E. Classically, these methods\
    \ can be classiﬁed\naccording to the three basic learning approaches presented\
    \ below: unsupervised learning,\nsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\
    Unsupervised learning looks for patterns in data with no pre-existing labels.\
    \ Its\ncentral approach is usually focused on organizing X data points into speciﬁc\
    \ groups [22].\nData points that are in the same group should have similar properties,\
    \ while data points\nin different groups should have highly different features.\
    \ It is important to note that\nthese potential groups are not previously deﬁned\
    \ and it is the purpose of unsupervised\nlearning algorithms to discover them.\
    \ Some examples of unsupervised learning methods\nare hierarchical clustering,\
    \ k-means, anomaly detection techniques, among others.\nSupervised learning is\
    \ the other fundamental area of Statistical Learning Methods [23].\nIt consists\
    \ of algorithms that learn a function ( f : X 7→ Y) by training with a ﬁnite number\n\
    of input-output pairs, X being the input domain and X the output co-domain. This\
    \ learning\nstage can be seen as E in Mitchell’s deﬁnition [21], and the speciﬁc\
    \ task T usually involves\npredicting an output given a new and unseen input [24].\
    \ Common families of methods that\nstand out in supervised learning are decision\
    \ tree-based (e.g., Decision Tree, Extra Trees),\ninstance-based (e.g., K-Nearest\
    \ Neighbors), kernel-based (e.g., Support Vector Machine), or\nensemble-based\
    \ methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost).\nSupervised learning problems can usually\
    \ be divided into classiﬁcation and regres-\nsion [25,26]. In both cases, the\
    \ basis is an input data-set, X, and their difference is the\ntype of target variable,\
    \ Y, to be predicted. In the classiﬁcation case, Y is divided into\ndiscrete categories,\
    \ while in regression, the aim is to predict continuous values. Standard\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ problems can be either binary or multi-class problems [27]. In the former\n\
    case, an instance can only be associated with one of two values: the positive\
    \ or negative\nequivalent to 0 or 1; whereas, in multi-class problems, there are\
    \ more than two classes\nunder consideration. A multi-class problem means that\
    \ a given instance belongs to one of\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n5 of 34\nthe multiple\
    \ possible categories. Diversely, a supervised regression problem [28] consists\n\
    of ﬁnding a function that can predict, for a given example, a real value in R.\n\
    The third learning approach is reinforcement learning [29]. In this case, the\
    \ focus is\non developing a learning agent able to observe the environment and\
    \ obtain some input\nfrom it. Then, the agent makes an action and it changes to\
    \ a new environment, receiving an\nevaluation value (award or penalty) related\
    \ to the action made. Unlike the unsupervised\nlearning approach, the agent receives\
    \ guidance from an external evaluation. Moreover,\ndifferent to supervised learning,\
    \ in reinforcement learning, the agent is provided with an\nevaluation value regarding\
    \ the action made and not with a clear speciﬁcation about the\ncorrespondence\
    \ between input and output data. Relevant approaches within reinforcement\nlearning\
    \ are value-based [30], policy-based [31], and model-based [32].\nLastly, it is\
    \ important to note that Artiﬁcial Neural Networks are not considered within\n\
    this family of methods. We will treat them as a separate class of methods because\
    \ of their\nimportant role in CI.\n2.2.2. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n\
    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems with an inner structure\n\
    that is based on a set of connected units, named neurons, as they are inspired\
    \ by a biological\nbrain. Just as is the case for animals, wherein two neurons\
    \ are connected by means of a link\n(synapses), the neurons of an ANN are connected\
    \ through edges that transmit signals from\none artiﬁcial neuron to another. The\
    \ signals transferred between neurons are represented by\nreal numbers, and the\
    \ output of each neural unit is computed by some non-linear function\nof the sum\
    \ of its inputs.\nEvery edge that connects two neurons (usually) has a weight\
    \ that is adjusted as the\nlearning process of the ANN is underway. The role of\
    \ such edges is to increase or decrease\nthe strength of the signal at the connection\
    \ of two neurons. Additionally, neural units are\naggregated into layers, and\
    \ they may carry out diverse transformations on the inputs that\nthey receive.\
    \ Thus, the purpose of ANNs is to process input data from the ﬁrst layer (input\n\
    layer) to the last layer (output layer), while approximating linear or non-linear\
    \ functions\nthat are generally unknown. The collection of neuron units arranged\
    \ in layers, edges, and\nweights forms a network topology that is usually called\
    \ an architecture (Figure 1). ANNs\nhave evolved into a broad family of architectures\
    \ that depend on the speciﬁc application\ndomain. The feed-forward neural network\
    \ is a type of classical architecture. In this network,\nthe input data moves\
    \ from the input layer directly through any hidden layers (intermediate\nlayers\
    \ located in-between the input and output layers) to the output layer.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Basic architecture of an ANN. It is composed of edges and neural units arranged\
    \ using\nan input layer (blue neural units), a hidden layer (white neural units),\
    \ and an output layer (yellow\nneural units).\nBecause of their ability to reproduce\
    \ and model nonlinear processes, ANNs have been\napplied in diverse supervised\
    \ learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning\nproblems. Application\
    \ areas may include time series forecasting, pattern recognition, signal\nclassiﬁcation,\
    \ among others. However, as more complex problems (e.g., image processing,\nspeech\
    \ recognition) have arisen in the last few years, further development in the ANN\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n6 of 34\narea is required to deal with resulting challenges.\
    \ The common denominator of these ﬁelds\nis the high complexity and enormous volumes\
    \ of data generated and managed in them.\nAs a result, a subset of ANNs, named\
    \ Deep Learning (DL) [33] has emerged to cope with\nthis complexity.\nA deep neural\
    \ network is a classical ANN composed of multiple layers between the\ninput and\
    \ output layers. Theoretically, DL architectures allow any non-linear function\
    \ to be\napproximated [34]. Therefore, this approach has become dominant in multiple\
    \ application\nﬁelds like computer vision [35] and natural language processing\
    \ [36]. Between the most\ncommon deep neural networks, we can ﬁnd recurrent neural\
    \ networks, convolutional\nneural networks, and long short-term memory neural\
    \ networks [37]. The main strength\nof this approach lies in its ability to learn\
    \ automatically from raw data and to learn more\ncomplex representations of data\
    \ than other Statistical Learning methods [38]. The latter\ncould be valuable\
    \ for research areas characterized by having complex data, which can\nbarely be\
    \ analyzed by human reasoning and classical data preprocessing approaches. The\n\
    other relevant characteristics of Deep neural architectures come from their architectural\n\
    ﬂexibility that enables data fusion, as they allow different data formats to merge,\
    \ combining\ndata from multiple sources and therefore extracting more valuable\
    \ knowledge. In other\nwords, DL facilitates the use of multi-dimensional data,\
    \ which is quite difﬁcult to achieve\nwith classical ANNs and ML methods.\n2.2.3.\
    \ CI-Based Optimization Methods\nThe growing computational capabilities and the\
    \ fact that some problems of great\npractical value (e.g., scheduling, routing,\
    \ facility location) can not be solved optimally\n(because they are NP-Hard problems)\
    \ has led to increased use of approximating algorithms.\nMeta-heuristics are a\
    \ suitable approach in situations where exact algorithms can not give an\nanswer\
    \ using a reasonable amount of time or memory [39]. These methods arose with the\n\
    idea of extracting the best parts of different successful heuristics to create\
    \ generic methods\nthat could be applied to a more signiﬁcant number of problems\
    \ and contexts. Due to the\nwide variety of meta-heuristics, different classiﬁcation\
    \ categories have been proposed [40].\nWe group these techniques according to\
    \ the next categories: Evolutionary Computation\n(EC) [41], Swarm Intelligence\
    \ (SI) [42], and other meta-heuristics (local search-based meta-\nheuristics [43]).\
    \ These groups are presented with more detail as follows.\nEC is a group of meta-heuristic\
    \ optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolu-\ntion. Within this family\
    \ of methods, they operate from an initial set of candidate solutions\n(initial\
    \ generation), which are updated in an iterative way. Then, each new generation\n\
    is generated by randomly removing candidate solutions according to predeﬁned criteria\n\
    and by inserting random changes. After a set of iterations, the population of\
    \ solutions\nwill gradually evolve to increase its competitiveness, framed by\
    \ a ﬁtness function that is\ndetermined by each algorithm. Following the described\
    \ procedure, EC algorithms can\nproduce highly optimized solutions for complex\
    \ real-world optimization problems like the\ntraveling salesman problem [44].\
    \ Some well-known examples of EC meta-heuristics are\nGenetic algorithms [45]\
    \ and Differential evolution [46], among others.\nThe second biggest category\
    \ of meta-heuristics is the category of Swarm Intelligence\n(SI). This approach\
    \ consists of a population of agents interacting with each other and their\nenvironment.\
    \ The agents follow a set of basic rules, and although there is no centralized\n\
    control structure guiding the agents on how they should behave, the interaction\
    \ between\nthem leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior. SI is inspired\
    \ by biological\nsystems such as ant and bee colonies and is commonly used to\
    \ solve combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimization problems (e.g., shortest path\
    \ problems for delivery or optimization\nof unknown parameters in time series).\
    \ Two of the most well-known SI algorithms are Ant\nColony [47], and Particle\
    \ Swarm [48] methods.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n7 of 34\nThe third category groups\
    \ together the rest of the meta-heuristics, which are outside\nof the domains\
    \ of EC and SI but are still relevant for solving optimization problems. For\n\
    example, this is the case for local search-based meta-heuristics that are focused\
    \ on ﬁnding\na solution that maximizes a criterion among a set of candidate solutions.\
    \ These meta-\nheuristics move from one solution to another in the search space\
    \ of candidate solutions\nby applying local changes until an optimal solution\
    \ is found or a time budget is reached.\nWithin this category of meta-heuristics,\
    \ representative methods include Tabu Search [49],\nand Greedy Randomized Adaptive\
    \ Search Procedure (also known as GRASP) [50].\n2.2.4. Fuzzy Systems\nClassical\
    \ logic is based on the crisp set concept, where a group of objects is considered\n\
    to be a collection. In this sense, a crisp subset can be deﬁned from a broader\
    \ set where its\nelements belong to the subset according to some particular condition.\
    \ Thus, we can deﬁne\nthe concept of membership wherein a value of one is assigned\
    \ to the elements of the subset\nand a value of zero to the elements that do not\
    \ belong to that subset. Unlike crisp sets, a\nfuzzy set allows partial belonging\
    \ to a set through a degree of membership, denoted by\na function µ, that maps\
    \ all the elements in the set to a value in the real interval between\nzero and\
    \ one [51]. Then, as in the crisp case, a value of zero means that the element\
    \ under\nconsideration does not belong to the set, and a value of one represents\
    \ that the element\nbelongs entirely to the set. However, unlike in the crisp\
    \ case, a value greater than zero\nand lower than one represents a partial membership\
    \ to the subset. Consequently, the set’s\nmembership function is the relationship\
    \ between the elements of the set and their degree\nof belonging.\nHaving introduced\
    \ the basic notions of fuzzy sets, the next key concept is fuzzy\ninference systems.\
    \ A fuzzy system is a repository of fuzzy expert knowledge that can\nreason the\
    \ data in vague terms instead of precise Boolean logic. This expert knowledge\
    \ is a\ncollection of fuzzy membership functions and a set of fuzzy rules that\
    \ is formed as follows:\nIF (conditions are fulﬁlled) THEN (consequences are inferred).\
    \ The basic conﬁguration of a\nfuzzy system is shown in Figure 2, and it can be\
    \ divided into four main parts: a fuzziﬁer, a\nknowledge base, an inference engine,\
    \ and a defuzziﬁer [52].\nFigure 2. Structure and components of a Fuzzy System.\n\
    The Fuzziﬁer maps a real crisp input to a fuzzy function and, therefore, determines\n\
    the degree of membership of the input to a vague concept (categories using the\
    \ fuzzy sets).\nThe values of the input variables are mapped to the range of values\
    \ of the corresponding\nuniverse of discourse. The range and resolution of input-fuzzy\
    \ sets and their effect on the\nfuzziﬁcation process are considered to be factors\
    \ that affect the overall performance of\nthe system.\nThe knowledge base comprises\
    \ the knowledge of the application domain. It can be\nsplit into a database of\
    \ deﬁnitions used to express linguistic control rules in the controller\nand a\
    \ rule base that describes the knowledge held by the experts in the domain. Intuitively,\n\
    the knowledge base is the core element of a fuzzy controller as it will contain\
    \ all the\ninformation necessary to accomplish its execution tasks.\nThe Inference\
    \ Engine provides the decision-making logic of the controller. It deduces\nthe\
    \ fuzzy control actions by employing fuzzy implications and fuzzy rules of inference.\
    \ In\nmany aspects, it can be viewed as an emulation of human decision-making.\
    \ Finally, the\nDefuzziﬁcation process converts fuzzy control values into crisp\
    \ quantities; that is, it links\na single point to a fuzzy set, given that the\
    \ point belongs to the support of the fuzzy set.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n8 of\
    \ 34\nThere are many de-fuzziﬁcation techniques, the most famous being the center-of-area\
    \ or\ncenter-of-gravity.\n2.2.5. Probabilistic Reasoning\nProbabilistic Reasoning\
    \ states that users can infer plausible models to explain input\ndata. Thus, a\
    \ model can predict an output based on new, unknown input data, which allows\n\
    decisions to be made regarding future actions. In this context of predictions,\
    \ uncertainty\nplays a relevant role for three reasons [53]. First, uncertainty\
    \ can be introduced from noisy\ninput data into the training process of a model.\
    \ Secondly, input data can be consistent with\ndifferent models, and therefore\
    \ which model is more appropriate for the data at hand is\nuncertain. And third,\
    \ a model can have diverse parameters (e.g., the coefﬁcients of linear\nregression)\
    \ and/or different inner structures (e.g., the architecture of ANNs); hence, there\n\
    is uncertainty regarding the speciﬁcations for a concrete model [54].\nFrom a\
    \ general perspective, the basic foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning are\n\
    condensed in the Bayesian learning paradigm [54]. Primarily, probability distributions\
    \ are\nconsidered to represent all uncertainties that can interfere in a model\
    \ (e.g., noise in the input\ndata, the model’s parameters). Then, the basic rules\
    \ of probability theory are considered\nto infer unobserved quantities given the\
    \ observed data. Thus, the process of learning\nfrom data occurs through the transformation\
    \ of the prior probability distributions (deﬁned\nbefore having the input data)\
    \ into posterior distributions (after observing the data).\nThe assumptions mentioned\
    \ above are supported by two of the basic rules of prob-\nability theory. They\
    \ are the sum rule and the product rule, which can be expressed as\nP(x) = ∑y∈Y\
    \ P(x, y) and P(x, y) = P(x)P(y | x), respectively. Here x and y correspond to\n\
    observed or uncertain quantities, taking values in sets X and Y. P(x) is the probability\
    \ of x\nregarding the frequency of observing a particular value. P(x, y) is the\
    \ joint probability of\nobserving x and y, and P(y|x) is the probability of y\
    \ conditioned on observing a concrete x\nvalue. Keeping these two probability\
    \ theory rules in mind, x and y can be integrated into\nthe Bayes’ theorem to\
    \ describe the probability of an event based on the prior knowledge\nof conditions\
    \ that might be related to the event. In the context of Statistical Learning,\
    \ this\ntheorem is stated as P(θ | D, m) = P(D|θ,m)P(θ|m)\nP(D|m)\n. Here, P(D\
    \ | θ, m) is the likelihood of\nparameters θ in model m, P(θ | m) is the prior\
    \ probability of θ, and P(θ | D, m) is the\nposterior probability of θ given data\
    \ x.\nThus, learning is the transformation of prior knowledge or assumptions regarding\
    \ the\nparameters P(θ | m), through data D, into the posterior knowledge about\
    \ the parameters\nP(θ | D, m). Such a posterior distribution then becomes prior\
    \ knowledge for future data\npredictions. Within this framework, the most typical\
    \ methods used over the last few years\nwere Bayesian networks [55]. Other representative\
    \ techniques are Markov networks and\nRandom Fields [56].\n2.2.6. Summary of CI-Based\
    \ Approaches\nHaving presented the families of CI methods usually considered in\
    \ FSC, this section\nintroduces a summary of the methods presented above and their\
    \ strengths and weak-\nnesses (Table 1). First of all, we would like to point\
    \ out that this list of advantages and\ndisadvantages does not refer to a comparison\
    \ between the different categories of methods\nconsidered in this paper, as they\
    \ are often used to solve different types of problems and\ntherefore the comparison\
    \ is not straightforward. Instead, these strengths and weaknesses\nrefer to a\
    \ comparison between CI-based approaches versus non CI-based approaches that\n\
    are used to solve similar categories of problems.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n9 of\

    \ are two-fold. First, it reviews the related work at the\npoint where FSC and\
    \ CI meet, in order to identify previous contributions regarding the\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ of FSC problems, and the CI methods used to solve them. Having already\nintroduced\
    \ these previous studies, the ﬁnal part of this section is devoted to presenting\
    \ the\nmain novelty and contributions of this paper.\nIn 2012, Grifﬁs et al. [11]\
    \ focused on the distribution stage of an FSC to present an\noverview of CI-based\
    \ optimization methods that can play a relevant role for problems like\nvehicle\
    \ routing, supply chain risks, and disruptions. The authors emphasized how meta-\n\
    heuristic techniques provide near-optimal solutions to logistics problems. Following\
    \ this\nline of research, in 2016, Wari and Zhu [12] presented an updated survey\
    \ on applying meta-\nheuristics to solve optimization problems in the processing\
    \ (e.g., fermentation, thermal\ndrying, and distillation) and distribution (e.g.,\
    \ warehousing location, production planning,\nand scheduling) stages of an FSC.\
    \ More recently, in 2017, Kamilaris et al. [7] reviewed\narticles on smart farming\
    \ to show how digital technologies can enhance the circularity of\nthe FSC at\
    \ the production stage. They highlighted the problems that can be approached by\n\
    utilizing CI-based Statistical Learning, ANNs, and DL methods.\nComplementary\
    \ to the advances reported by Kamilaris et al. [7], in 2020, Sharma et al. [15]\n\
    and Misra et al. [2] carried out a bibliometric analysis and a review, respectively,\
    \ of CI-\nbased Statistical Learning applications over the whole FSC. Based on\
    \ their results, the\nauthors designed a series of recommendations to design and\
    \ deploy Statistical Learning-\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n10 of 34\nbased solutions\
    \ for data-driven decision-making processes in the FSC. In the same year,\nCamarena\
    \ [10] made a critical analysis of what can be done with Artiﬁcial Intelligence,\n\
    without emphasizing any single method in particular, for the transition to a sustainable\n\
    FSC. Lastly, the studies of Liakos et al. [6] and Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Mas [9],\
    \ in 2018 and\n2020, respectively, presented comprehensive reviews of research\
    \ directed at the application\nof ML in the FSC production stage. The authors\
    \ surveyed how ML can help farmers make\nmore informed decisions on the management\
    \ of agriculture and livestock systems.\nFigure 3 presents a synthesis of the\
    \ studies described above and highlights how this\narticle complements and extends\
    \ the existing literature. Each cited paper is represented\nby a grey circle,\
    \ which can have one or two inner circles (green and blue). Green circles\nrepresent\
    \ FSC stages covered by a study, while blue circles depict the CI approaches\n\
    considered within it. The size of the circle is determined by the number of FSC\
    \ stages and\nCI techniques considered in each article. Thus, a green circle would\
    \ have the biggest size if\nthe paper to which it belongs addresses the four basic\
    \ stages of the FSC. The same logic is\nused for the blue circles: the more families\
    \ of methods a paper considers, the bigger the\ncircle’s size would be. Furthermore,\
    \ we can ﬁnd our research article in the center of the\nﬁgure in the violet circle.\n\
    Figure 3. Motivations and state-of-the-art concepts at the point where FSC and\
    \ CI meet.\nAccording to Figure 3 we can see that there are no research articles\
    \ that present a\ncomprehensive taxonomy at the point where FSC problems and CI\
    \ converge. This means\nthat there are no research studies that consider the problems\
    \ of the four basic FSC stages,\nnor the diversity of the CI methods that can\
    \ be applied to solve them. Instead, most of the\npapers focus on one or two FSC\
    \ stages, and they tend to review the role a unique CI family\nof methods has\
    \ over them. Therefore, we propose a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete\
    \ FSC and the ﬁve families of CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n11 of 34\nFurthermore, our proposal extends the previous\
    \ classiﬁcation efforts by adding a new\ncategorization attribute, which indicates\
    \ the type of FSC problem being addressed from\na CI perspective. In addition\
    \ to increasing the classiﬁcation capacity of our taxonomy,\nthis attribute allows\
    \ us to establish a novel mapping between the FSC problems and the\ntypologies\
    \ of CI problems that can be used to approach the former ones. By doing so,\n\
    we contribute to facilitating the choice of the most convenient family of CI methods\
    \ to\nuse depending on the FSC problem at hand. This represents a valuable and\
    \ novel source\nof information for FSC researchers and practitioners who aim to\
    \ incorporate CI-based\nsolutions into their FSC applications.\n3. A Taxonomy\
    \ of CI-Based Problems in the Food Supply Chain\nThis section introduces details\
    \ of the taxonomy proposed. First, Section 3.1 presents\nthe methodology followed\
    \ to design the taxonomy. Then, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 show the\ntaxonomy’s structure\
    \ and describe its parts. Finally, Section 3.5 gives an overview of the\ncategorization\
    \ of FSC problems, from a CI perspective, using the taxonomy.\n3.1. Methodology\
    \ for the Design of the Taxonomy\nThis section introduces the methodology followed\
    \ to build the taxonomy proposed.\nFirst, we note that this research paper does\
    \ not aim to carry out a systematic literature\nreview or survey. Instead, our\
    \ scope lies in searching and reviewing the representative\nliterature to propose\
    \ a taxonomy that describes and categorizes FSC problems and how\nthey are solved\
    \ from a CI-based perspective. As such, the taxonomy proposed does not seek\n\
    to identify all details associated with the FSC problems to maintain its comprehensibility\n\
    and size. It is designed according to core characteristics that may alter the\
    \ complexity and\nmodeling of FSC problems from the CI perspective.\nWith these\
    \ ideas in mind, Figure 4 shows the methodology followed to build the\ntaxonomy\
    \ introduced in this research paper. This methodology follows a structure-based\n\
    literature review that includes the steps depicted in Figure 4. The ﬁrst step\
    \ is named Scope\n& Research Question, which aims to limit the areas of knowledge\
    \ to be consulted; that is,\nthe point where FSC and CI converge. For this step,\
    \ the research questions that guided\nour search were: “What are the most common\
    \ FSC problems reported in the literature?”,\n“What are the CI methods typically\
    \ used to approach these problems?”, “How can FSC\nbe categorized from a CI perspective?”,\
    \ and “Is there any taxonomy to categorize FSC\nproblems considering a CI approach?”.\n\
    Figure 4. Steps followed to build the proposed taxonomy.\nThe following step deﬁned\
    \ the search set-up. We deﬁne the keywords, periods,\nonline resources, and criteria\
    \ to search and review the scientiﬁc literature. The keywords\nconsidered were:\
    \ Food Supply Chain(s), agrifood, ﬁsh farming, agriculture, livestock,\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n12 of 34\nproduction, processing, distribution, logistics, retail,\
    \ computational intelligence machine\nlearning, deep learning, meta-heuristics,\
    \ fuzzy systems, and probabilistic methods. The\nperiod was between 2012 and 2020,\
    \ and the bibliographic resources searched were the\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and\
    \ Google Scholar. Finally, the main criteria for selecting and\nreviewing the\
    \ literature was that they be review or survey papers. The latter is based on\n\
    the fact that this type of paper offers a general and consolidated overview of\
    \ the state-of-\nthe-art concerning CI-based FSC problems reported in the literature.\
    \ Moreover, these types\nof papers allowed us to know if any taxonomy was previously\
    \ proposed to classify the\nFSC problems.\nThe next stage in Figure 4 is search,\
    \ select, and review. Using the search set-up\nmentioned above, we identiﬁed the\
    \ survey and review papers introduced in the Motivation\nSection 2.3. Next, we\
    \ analyzed the FSC problems considered in these papers, the FSC stages\nwhere\
    \ the problems were located, and the families of CI methods usually considered\
    \ to\napproach these FSC problems.\nBased on the ﬁndings mentioned above, we moved\
    \ to the ﬁnal step of the methodology\nshown in Figure 4. The objective was to\
    \ design a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete FSC and the ﬁve families of\
    \ CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\nThis taxonomy also intends\
    \ to expand the previous classiﬁcation efforts by adding a\nnew categorization\
    \ attribute, indicating the type of FSC problem addressed from a CI\nperspective.\
    \ Thus, we characterized how the FSC problems identiﬁed in the previous\nstep\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. To do so, we considered the typologies\n\
    of problems in the CI domain (problem-solving, uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\n\
    knowledge discovery and function approximation, and communication and perception)\n\
    that better suited the families of CI methods considered in the studies reviewed.\n\
    Having built the taxonomy, we checked its robustness and ability to discriminate\n\
    papers that approached different FSC problems. To accomplish this aim, we extracted\n\
    relevant references cited by the review and survey papers previously identiﬁed,\
    \ as well as\nthe recent literature, and mapped them into the proposed taxonomy.\
    \ This is shown in the\nfollowing section, where the taxonomy is introduced, to\
    \ validate its classiﬁcation power.\n3.2. The Taxonomy Overview\nThe taxonomy\
    \ aims, ﬁrstly, to extend the previous classiﬁcation efforts on FSC prob-\nlems\
    \ to cover all stages of Agrifood supply chains; and, secondly, to add a new level\
    \ of\ncategorization that allows typologies of FSC problems to be mapped to typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems. We can see the structure of the proposed taxonomy in Figure\
    \ 5. As we can see,\nin level one, the taxonomy includes the four basic stages\
    \ of an FSC that were introduced in\nSection 2.2.1; that is, production, processing,\
    \ distribution, and retail. Then, in level two, it\ncontains the different categories\
    \ of FSC problems that we can ﬁnd in each stage. It is impor-\ntant to clarify\
    \ that although these FSC problems have been reported previously, in related\n\
    studies [2,6–12], to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that their\
    \ deﬁnitions are\nuniﬁed and consolidated in one taxonomy. Lastly, in level three,\
    \ the taxonomy introduces\nthe typologies of problems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ this level seeks to classify\nthe FSC problems depending on how they can be\
    \ modeled and solved by CI methods.\nHaving presented the structure of the taxonomy,\
    \ the following Section 3.3 details\nthe FSC problems identiﬁed for the production,\
    \ processing, distribution, and retail stages.\nThose problems represent the second\
    \ level of the taxonomy. They are formally deﬁned\nfrom a purely FSC perspective,\
    \ and we clearly state the key objective of each problem\nwithin the particular\
    \ chain stage where it is identiﬁed. Afterwards, Section 3.4 presents\nthe third\
    \ level of the taxonomy that contains the attributes to categorize the FSC problems\n\
    of level 2 under a CI approach. These attributes correspond to the four typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems that are more commonly used in the literature to address FSC\
    \ problems. Finally,\nSection 3.5 introduces the classiﬁcation and mapping of\
    \ FSC problems according to how\nthey can be modeled by CI typologies.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n13 of 34\nFigure 5. A taxonomy of computational intelligence\
    \ in an FSC.\n3.3. Level 2: Identiﬁcation and Deﬁnition of Food Supply Chain Problems\n\
    In this section, we present the FSC problems identiﬁed for each of the FSC stages\n\
    shown in Figure 5, which corresponds to the second level of our taxonomy. These\
    \ problems\nare formally deﬁned in more detail below.\n3.3.1. Production Problems\n\
    The FSC production stage can be split into three main production systems: ﬁsh\n\
    farming, agriculture, and livestock. These three production systems and their\
    \ associated\nproblems can be observed in Figure 6 and they are deﬁned below.\n\
    Figure 6. FSC problems in the production stage.\nFish farming (also known as pisciculture)\
    \ is the production system concerned with\nraising ﬁsh in closed environments,\
    \ such as ponds or tanks, for human consumption. Nowa-\ndays nearly half of the\
    \ ﬁsh consumed in the word are raised in artiﬁcial environments [57].\nFish farming\
    \ production has a high degree of complexity as it involves interrelated physical\n\
    (e.g., water and nutrient supply), chemical (e.g., pH, oxygen), and environmental\
    \ (e.g.,\nwaste generated) elements. Therefore, the management of this process\
    \ requires advanced\nsensing, control, and communication technologies as well\
    \ as expert knowledge to make\nefﬁcient and sustainable decisions, and maximize\
    \ the productivity. Within this context, the\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n14 of 34\n\
    most typical CI-based processes reported in the literature are ﬁsh weight estimation\
    \ [58],\nproduction estimation, and optimization [59]. Their deﬁnitions are presented\
    \ below.\n•\nFish weight estimation: This process estimates ﬁsh weight considering\
    \ morphological\nfeatures (e.g., length, width, and mass).\n•\nProduction estimation\
    \ and optimization: This process is centered on the optimiza-\ntion of ﬁsh production\
    \ and forecasting of seasonal demand to adjust the production.\nTo accomplish\
    \ such aims, the optimization of production is carried out by monitoring\ncrucial\
    \ elements of ﬁsh ponds, like water oxygen levels, nutrients, and food supply,\n\
    which inﬂuence the growth of ﬁsh. Meanwhile, historical records of seasonal de-\n\
    mand are stored and continuously analyzed to determine the most suitable levels\
    \ of\nproduction depending on the year and season.\nThe following production system\
    \ considered in this study is agriculture, in particular,\nhorticulture. Horticulture\
    \ is the greenhouse industry dedicated to plant cultivation and\nprocessing of\
    \ different types of crops for food and commercial consumption (e.g., ﬂowers,\n\
    fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs). The main challenges of these production\
    \ systems\nare to improve plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and\
    \ resistance to insects,\ndiseases, and environmental stress.\nIn order to achieve\
    \ these improvements, different processes are managed to try and\nmaintain a balance\
    \ between efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability, such as monitoring\nand\
    \ controlling indoor-outdoor climate conditions, crop management, and production\
    \ fore-\ncasting, among others. They are commonly approached in the specialized\
    \ literature [6,9,60]\nin open-ﬁeld agriculture and intensive horticulture. Within\
    \ the most representative pro-\ncesses, we ﬁnd the crop yield and harvest forecasting\
    \ [60–62], crop protection [63,64],\nweather prediction and irrigation management\
    \ [65,66], and site-speciﬁc nutrient manage-\nment [67,68]. These processes, which\
    \ are shown in Figure 6, are deﬁned as follows.\n•\nCrop yield and harvesting\
    \ prediction: This problem is focused on yield estimation\nto match crop supply\
    \ with demand and on crop management to increase productivity.\n•\nCrop protection:\
    \ This is based on the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of biotic (infesta-\ntions,\
    \ diseases, and weeds) and abiotic (nutrients, water deﬁciency) stress factors\
    \ that\naffect crop productivity.\n•\nWeather prediction and irrigation management:\
    \ This problem is mainly concerned\nwith weather forecasting for the optimal use\
    \ of water, which enables the design and\ndeployment of crop irrigation scheduling\
    \ and planning.\n•\nSite-speciﬁc nutrient management: This is based on the management\
    \ of soil quality\nto determine which nutrients need to be supplied in order to\
    \ maintain the chemical\ncharacteristics required for the crop under consideration.\n\
    Lastly, the third production system considered for the production stage is livestock.\n\
    This production system is dedicated to the growth and management of domestic animals\n\
    (e.g., cattle, sheep, and goats) raised in agricultural settings to generate food\
    \ products like\nmeat, eggs, or milk, among others. Livestock can be carried out\
    \ through either extensive or\nintensive systems. Extensive systems involve animals\
    \ roaming grasslands (usually under\nthe supervision of a herdsman). Diversely,\
    \ intensive livestock is located in closed infras-\ntructures and is equipped\
    \ with ICT technology, which enables animals to be monitored\nin real-time. Within\
    \ these production systems the most typical problems we come across\nare grassland\
    \ monitoring [69], animal welfare [70], animal behavior tracking [71], and\nlivestock\
    \ production prediction and optimization [72,73], as shown in Figure 6. The formal\n\
    deﬁnitions of these problems from an FSC perspective are listed below.\n•\nGrassland\
    \ monitoring: This problem is related to the accurate identiﬁcation of grass-\n\
    land inventories in order to discriminate between the most suitable types for\
    \ live-\nstock purposes.\n•\nAnimal welfare: This is focused on the pattern classiﬁcation\
    \ of ingestive behavior in\ngrazing animals for studies of animal nutrition, growth,\
    \ and health.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n15 of 34\n•\nAnimal behavior tracking:\
    \ This is based on the use of behavior analysis to detect\nearly signs of health\
    \ issues and promote early intervention.\n•\nLivestock production: This problem\
    \ is centered on predictions and estimations of\nfarming parameters to optimize\
    \ the economic-energy efﬁciency and sustainability of\nproduction systems.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Processing Problems\nOnce the raw materials of food products have been grown,\
    \ they are delivered to the\nnext step of the FSC, or ‘processing’. Different\
    \ industrial processes (e.g., washing, disinfect-\ning, packaging) are carried\
    \ out in this stage to transform the raw output of production into\nedible food\
    \ products. Depending on the production system under consideration and the\nfood\
    \ products obtained from them, diverse industrial processes can be followed to\
    \ obtain\nthe goods that move on to the distribution stage. However, in spite\
    \ of such production\nparticularities, we have identiﬁed a set of common problems\
    \ that could occur in the three\nproduction systems presented in the section above.\
    \ These problems are shown in Figure 7\nand they are: demand prediction [74],\
    \ production planning for distribution [75], prediction\nof post-harvest losses\
    \ [76], and manufacturing industry processes, such as cooking, drying,\nand others\
    \ [77].\nFigure 7. FSC problems in the processing stage.\n•\nDemand prediction:\
    \ This problem in concerneed with the demand prediction of food\nrequirements\
    \ to avoid overstocking, overproduction, and over-utilization of resources.\n\
    The key idea is to estimate the quantity of food products that will be sold to\
    \ deﬁne\nhow much raw material needs to be processed.\n•\nProduction planning\
    \ for distribution: This is centered on production planning to\nmatch distribution\
    \ requirements. This problem is mostly determined by the sale\nvolumes that a\
    \ particular food product is expected to have.\n•\nPrediction of post-harvest\
    \ losses: This is focused on making estimations of food\nlosses associated with\
    \ the processing procedures carried out after harvesting raw\nmaterials coming\
    \ from the production stage.\n•\nFood manufacturing industry: This is associated\
    \ with the optimization of the pro-\ncessing technologies required to transform\
    \ raw foods into edible food (e.g., thermal,\ndrying, contact cooking, microwave\
    \ heating, etc.). These processes are performed\nusing industrial machinery.\n\
    3.3.3. Distribution Problems\nIn the third step of the food supply chain, food\
    \ products ready for human consumption\nare received from the processing stage\
    \ to be delivered to end-consumers. Speciﬁcally,\nﬁnished products arrive at warehouses,\
    \ and from there, the shipment department is\nin charge of deﬁning the most suitable\
    \ strategy to deliver products to end-consumers.\nThe essential purpose is to\
    \ distribute food products on time by the date speciﬁed in the\nretail stage.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n16 of 34\nFor this particular stage of the FSC, the most\
    \ common problems reported in the spe-\ncialized literature are shown in Figure\
    \ 8 and deﬁned below. These problems include vehicle\nrouting and ﬂeet management\
    \ [78,79], storage location assignment [80,81], prediction of\nsupply chain risks\
    \ and disruptions [82,83], shelf life prediction and maturity level [84–86],\n\
    demand forecasting [87], and last mile delivery [88].\nFigure 8. FSC problems\
    \ in the distribution stage.\n•\nVehicle routing and ﬂeet management: This is\
    \ focused on determining the most\noptimal route for the delivery of food under\
    \ different scenario constraints (e.g., size of\nthe ﬂeet, fuel availability,\
    \ etc.).\n•\nStorage location assignment problem: This problem is concerned with\
    \ deciding the\nmost suitable way to store food products in a set of warehouses\
    \ in order to cope with\ndaily demand operations.\n•\nPrediction of supply chain\
    \ risks and disruptions: This is concerned with the fore-\ncasting of potential\
    \ disruptions in the logistics of food products and their associated\nfood losses.\n\
    •\nShelf life prediction and maturity level: This problem is related to the forecasting\
    \ of\nshelf life based on data sensed during the distribution process.\n•\nDemand\
    \ forecasting: This consists of understanding demand behaviors and forecast-\n\
    ing user demand generated from the retail stage. Thus, it is possible to optimize\
    \ the\ndelivery routes and warehouse locations used during the distribution stage.\n\
    •\nLast mile delivery: This problem is dedicated to the delivery of food products\
    \ using\nthe local road transport network (last mile) of cities.\n3.3.4. Retail\
    \ Problems\nIn the ﬁnal part of the FSC, we ﬁnd the retail stage. At this point,\
    \ food products are\nreceived through the distribution channels, ready for sale.\
    \ This stage encompasses the\nconcept of an ’end-consumer’, which could be supermarkets\
    \ or clients that go to these\nplaces to buy food products. The most common problems\
    \ identiﬁed in the literature for\nthis stage of the supply chain are deﬁned below\
    \ and are also summarized in Figure 9.\nLastly, we characterized the retail stage\
    \ (Figure 5). Retail-related problems commonly\naddressed with CI, in this link\
    \ of the FSC, are diet and nutrition applications [89,90],\nfood consumption and\
    \ food waste [91,92], consumer demand, perception and buying\nbehavior [93,94],\
    \ dynamic discounting based on the sell-by date [95], and day demand\nprediction\
    \ and inventory management [74].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n17 of 34\nFigure 9.\
    \ FSC problems in the retail stage.\n•\nDiet and Nutrition: This is based on estimating\
    \ nutrient values using the classiﬁcation\nof food dishes and dietary assessment.\n\
    •\nFood consumption and food waste: This problem is associated with the identification\n\
    and prediction of food waste based on the buying and storage behavior of end-customers.\n\
    •\nConsumer demand, perception, and buying behavior: This problem is focused on\n\
    determining consumer proﬁles in order to predict buying behaviors and support\
    \ the\nmanagement of shop counters.\n•\nDynamic discounting based on sell-by date:\
    \ This is centered on automated price\nchanges at supermarkets based on the sell-by\
    \ date. The objective is to offer larger\ndiscounts for items with the shortest\
    \ remaining shelf life.\n•\nDaily demand prediction and inventory management:\
    \ This problem consists of\npredicting daily demand to better manage product stocks\
    \ at supermarkets.\n3.4. Level 3: Typologies of CI Problems\nIn this section,\
    \ we introduce the attributes that represent the most typical typologies\nof CI\
    \ modeling approaches used in the FSC literature. The attributes correspond to\
    \ the\nthird level of the taxonomy shown in Figure 5, and they are presented below.\n\
    •\nProblem-solving: This category is related to problems of complex decision-making\n\
    processes that need to be solved, keeping two key objectives in mind: quality\
    \ of the\nsolution and the computational time required to solve it. As a common\
    \ denominator,\nthis attribute categorizes problems that are NP-hard. Thus, this\
    \ class embodies FSC\nproblems for which there is no certainty that the method\
    \ can optimally solve them\nin a polynomial time (time complexity [96]) with respect\
    \ to the input data size. This\ncategory includes, for example, optimization or\
    \ search problems such as the vehicle\nrouting problem in the transportation stage\
    \ of the FSC.\n•\nUncertain knowledge and reasoning: This category corresponds\
    \ to FSC problems\ncharacterized by having partially observable, non-deterministic,\
    \ vague, or imprecise\ndata. In such uncertain scenarios, this attribute represents\
    \ problems that can be\naddressed in two possible ways. First, by using an approach\
    \ that acts based on\nassumptions of uncertain input data in order to give a probabilistic-based\
    \ solution\nto the problem at hand. Or second, by representing and reasoning with\
    \ the partially\navailable information in a manner similar to the way that humans\
    \ express knowledge\nand summarize data. This second approach allows non-exact\
    \ data to be represented\nin linguist terms in order to make decisions within\
    \ certain margins of correctness.\n•\nKnowledge discovery and function approximation:\
    \ This class represents FSC prob-\nlems that are distinguished by having large\
    \ volumes of data, which enable under-\nstanding and useful knowledge to be extracted\
    \ from them. Such knowledge could be\nused to make either predictions of future\
    \ events or discrimination and recognition of\npatterns. These types of problems\
    \ can usually be addressed with methods that can be\ntrained using the available\
    \ data to learn a speciﬁc task.\n•\nCommunication and perception: This category\
    \ consists of FSC problems focused\non the automatic extraction, analysis, and\
    \ understanding of information obtained\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n18 of 34\nfrom\
    \ digital images, texts, or voice recordings. It is worth noting that within the\
    \ FSC\ndomain, most problems solved using a communication and perception approach\
    \ are\nfocused on designing and developing autonomous computer vision systems.\
    \ These\nsystems are able to process high-dimensional data to support decision-making;\
    \ from\nobject detection to video tracking and object recognition.\n3.5. Mapping\
    \ Process between Level 2 and Level 3: Classiﬁcation of FSC Problems from a\n\
    CI Perspective\nThis section presents the categorization of FSC problems previously\
    \ identiﬁed in\nSection 3.3 from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, every problem\
    \ is categorized according\nto the four typologies of CI problems that we described\
    \ above: problem-solving, uncer-\ntain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation, and\ncommunication and perception. In addition,\
    \ using relevant work from the recent FSC\nliterature, we show how the taxonomy\
    \ is able to effectively and robustly discriminate these\npapers. Thus, Section\
    \ 3.5.1 is devoted to classifying the FSC problems coming from the\nproduction\
    \ stage. Then, Section 3.5.2 introduces the classiﬁcation of problems deﬁned for\n\
    the processing stage. Lastly, Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 expose the categorization\
    \ of problems\nfor the distribution and retail phases, respectively.\n3.5.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Production Problems\nFigure 10 presents the categorization of production\
    \ problems for the ﬁsh farming\nand livestock cases. The attributes of the taxonomy\
    \ are depicted on the left in Figure 10,\nwhereas the ﬁsh farming (in purple)\
    \ and livestock (in red) problems are found on the right.\nThe problems and attributes\
    \ are connected by gray bars that connect the ways in which a\nspeciﬁc problem\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. Fish weight estimation, grassland\nmonitoring,\
    \ animal welfare, and animal behavior tracking are problems that are classiﬁed\n\
    using the communication and perception attribute. This is justiﬁed due to the\
    \ fact that\nthese problems are usually characterized by having image and video\
    \ records as input\ndata (non-structured data). Having such data implies the use\
    \ of automatic information\nextraction by means of computer vision systems, based\
    \ on DL, which allow extraction of\nhigh-dimensional patterns embedded in image\
    \ and video data [97–103].\nFigure 10. Fish farming and livestock problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\nThe production estimation and optimization and livestock\
    \ production problems in\nFigure 10 are classiﬁed using the knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation and\nuncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes.\
    \ Such categorization is determined by the\ncentral characteristics of these problems,\
    \ which are concerned with the prediction and\noptimization of production values\
    \ using historical data records (structured data) [104,105].\nBesides, production\
    \ forecasting contains uncertainties regarding external factors of the\nproduction\
    \ systems, which encourage the use of probabilistic methods, such as the studies\n\
    carried out by [106,107].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n19 of 34\nFigure 11 shows the\
    \ categorization of agriculture problems. As we can seen, crop\nprotection, which\
    \ usually involves video and image records, is categorized as a com-\nmunication\
    \ and perception problem commonly used in DL methods like convolutional\nand recurrent\
    \ neural networks [108–110]. On the other hand, the remaining agricultural\nproblems\
    \ can be categorized under knowledge discovery and function approximation,\nproblem-solving,\
    \ and uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes as explained below.\nIn terms\
    \ of knowledge discovery and function approximation, this attribute categorizes\n\
    problems focused on the prediction of greenhouse conditions for the optimal management\n\
    of crop production, nutrients, and irrigation supply. This can be done using supervised\n\
    learning techniques that forecast variables of interest like temperature, water,\
    \ or nitro-\ngen [6,111]. Secondly, the problem-solving attribute categorizes\
    \ the weather prediction and\nirrigation management and the site-speciﬁc management\
    \ problems. These problems can be\ndeﬁned as optimization scenarios in which we\
    \ can ﬁnd concrete values associated with\nweather, irrigation, and nutrients.\
    \ In this case, the most common approach to solving them\nis based on meta-heuristics\
    \ [112–114].\nFinally, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes characterize\
    \ the same prob-\nlems that fall into the knowledge discovery and function approximation\
    \ attribute. The\ndifference lies in the fact that the agriculture problems are\
    \ approached as decision systems\nunder uncertainty. In this case, fuzzy logic\
    \ is the most suitable strategy to accomplish such\nan aim [115–117] Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the fuzzy approach allows us to evaluate whether particular\nactions need to\
    \ be taken according to sensed and predicted conditions coming from agri-\nculture\
    \ systems (e.g., optimal management strategies for the control of temperature\
    \ control\ninside greenhouse systems).\nFigure 11. Agriculture problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.2. Classiﬁcation of Processing Problems\nHaving\
    \ presented the production stage, Figure 12 features the categorization of prob-\n\
    lems in the processing stage. Any of the depicted FSC problems are classiﬁed using\
    \ the\ncommunication and perception attribute, mainly because the type of input\
    \ data they handle\nis not associated with images or video records. In contrast,\
    \ when the aim is to determine\nfuture scenarios based on the available data,\
    \ all problems tend to have historical data as\ntheir input data.\nPrecisely,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute categorizes\nthe\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses and demand prediction problems as being super-\n\
    vised learning problems, whose aims are to claasify and forecast the objective\
    \ variable.\nFor instance, we consider research from [8,118] to be within this\
    \ category. Following the\ntaxonomy’s attributes in Figure 12, the problem-solving\
    \ attribute can represent and model\ndemand predictions, the food manufacturing\
    \ industry, and production planning for dis-\ntribution problems. In this scenario,\
    \ they are classiﬁed as being optimization problems,\nwith the objective of optimizing\
    \ procedures related to the problems listed. An example, for\ninstance, could\
    \ be the optimization of industrial manufacturing processes, like heating and\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n20 of 34\ndrying, using meta-heuristic techniques. Examples\
    \ of studies categorized by the taxonomy\nof the previously mentioned approaches\
    \ are found in [119,120].\nLastly, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attribute\
    \ system also classiﬁes produc-\ntion planning for distribution problems. Probabilistic\
    \ methods tend to be used to approach\nthese kind of problems as production planning\
    \ can incorporate uncertainty coming from\nprocesses that are not directly related\
    \ to the production process, which can cope with\nprobability theory [121]. An\
    \ example of this last situation could be a change in the delivery\ndate due to\
    \ delays attributable to the weather [122].\nFigure 12. Processing problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.3. Classiﬁcation of Distribution Problems\nFigure\
    \ 13 exhibits the classiﬁcation of FSC problems in the distribution stage. Unlike\n\
    the two previous stages (production and processing), the predominant approaches\
    \ here are\nthe ones imposed by the problem-solving and knowledge discovery and\
    \ function approxi-\nmation attributes. The former attribute categorizes vehicle\
    \ routing and ﬂeet management,\nthe storage location assignment problem, and last\
    \ mile delivery problems, as they are\ndevoted to optimizing routing and delivery\
    \ situations. The purpose of these applications\nis to optimize, using meta-heuristics,\
    \ a concrete goal under different constraints; for in-\nstance, ﬂeet size, available\
    \ fuel, and others. Representative studies that fall in this category\nare [123–127].\n\
    The knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes prediction\n\
    of chain and disruptions, a shelf life prediction and maturity level, and demand\
    \ forecasting\nproblems. This attribute classiﬁes these problems under a supervised\
    \ learning perspective,\nwhere the aim is to predict expected values, such as\
    \ we can see in research carried out\nin [84,128–131]. For instance, potential\
    \ disruptions to the cold food products chain, or an\nestimation of how much product\
    \ volume needs to be distributed to meet retail demands.\nFigure 13. Distribution\
    \ problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.4. Classiﬁcation of Retail\
    \ Problems\nFinally, Figure 14 introduces the classification of problems in the\
    \ retail stage of\nthe FSC. In this last step, the communication and perception\
    \ attribute appears once\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n21 of 34\nagain to represent\
    \ the problems in which the input data correspond to non-structured\ndata, such\
    \ as images (dynamic discounting, daily demand prediction, and inventory\nmanagement)\
    \ [95,132–135]. For these particular cases, the problems can be modeled using\n\
    DL techniques to determining price discounts based on stock levels inside supermarkets\n\
    and by managing inventories according to food product existence.\nContrarily,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes\nproblems\
    \ associated with the extraction of patterns (food consumption and food waste),\n\
    the prediction of future values related to consumer demand and buying behavior,\
    \ and the\ngeneration of healthy menus or estimating nutritional values. Research\
    \ articles on this\nattribute include [89,90,136–139]. Furthermore, this attribute\
    \ can also classify the dynamic\ndiscounting and daily demand prediction and inventory\
    \ management problems when\ntheir input data corresponds to structured information\
    \ like historical records.\nIn addition to the attributes mentioned above, the\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nand problem-solving attributes can be used\
    \ to categorize a couple of problems in the retail\nstage. Those problems are\
    \ consumer demand, perception, and buying behavior, as well\nas daily demand prediction\
    \ and inventory management. Consumer demand, perception,\nand buying behavior\
    \ can be approached with a probabilistic system [140–142], for instance,\nuncertainty\
    \ concerning what food products are expected to be bought. Meanwhile, daily\n\
    demand prediction and inventory management can be addressed with an optimization\n\
    paradigm [143,144]. For this case, the aim is to optimize stock levels in such\
    \ a way that\nfood waste can be decreased or even to avoiding over-stocking issues\
    \ completely.\nFigure 14. Retail problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n\
    4. Guidelines for the Use of Computational Intelligence Approaches in the Food\n\
    Supply Chain\nHaving presented and validated the taxonomy of FSC problems, this\
    \ section presents\na set of guidelines for researchers and practitioners in FSC\
    \ for the use of CI within this\ndomain (Figure 15). Concretely, we try to guide\
    \ the users to (1) select the typology of a\nCI problem that they are addressing;\
    \ and (2) identify what families of CI methods could\nbe more suitable for the\
    \ problem at hand. The latter does not mean that in all cases the\nfamily of methods\
    \ suggested is the most appropriate, as this may depend on the speciﬁc\ncharacteristics\
    \ of the problem being addressed.\nThe guidelines depicted in Figure 15 start\
    \ with a basic question posed to the user:\n“What is the purpose and modeling\
    \ characteristics of the problem at hand?” (it could be\ncommunication and perception,\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving). If the purpose is the automatic analysis\nand extraction\
    \ of information from digital images to decide on the action to be taken\nregarding\
    \ the management of food supply systems (communication and perception), the\n\
    suitable family of methods would be deep neural networks (e.g., convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks). This family of CI methods enables the creation of computer\
    \ vision systems,\nwhich allows the environment of object characteristics to be\
    \ perceived in a visual way.\nBased on this visual analysis, these systems communicate\
    \ or recommend actions that\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n22 of 34\nachieve desired\
    \ states or match predeﬁned conditions (e.g., identify the quality of potatoes\n\
    in order to evaluate the units that are either damaged or edible).\nFigure 15.\
    \ Guidelines for the method selection problem in the food supply chain. Pd: production,\
    \ Ps:\nprocessing, D: distribution, R: retail.\nIf the objective of the user is\
    \ to handle problems characterized by partially observable,\nnon-deterministic,\
    \ or imprecise data (uncertain knowledge and reasoning), fuzzy systems\nor probabilistic\
    \ methods are recommended. For the former CI approach, it is important\nto highlight\
    \ that fuzzy systems need to be paired with hardware (e.g., PID controllers)\n\
    to work properly in food applications. This is due to the fact that hardware components\n\
    allow decisions made by fuzzy systems to be translated into actions (e.g., management\n\
    of nutrients and irrigation supply inside a greenhouse system depending on conditions\n\
    associated with temperature). Probabilistic methods are suitable for making estimations\
    \ of\nrelevant variables (e.g., planning production according to seasonal demand)\
    \ in scenarios\nwith partially observable data.\nWhen the users’ aim is directed\
    \ at making predictions from historical data, making\nclassiﬁcations that discriminate\
    \ between data categories, or ﬁnding hidden patterns in data,\nthe best modeling\
    \ approach to use is knowledge discovery and function approximation.\nFirstly,\
    \ for predictions and classiﬁcations, the user should determine the type of input\n\
    data at hand. In general terms, the input data can be structured (e.g., historical\
    \ records,\ntabular data) or unstructured (e.g., video, images). In the former,\
    \ and depending on the\ndata size, the supervised learning techniques are the\
    \ CI methods to be used when facing\nsmall, medium, and large data no bigger than\
    \ 40–50 gigabytes. Supervised DL, how-\never, is the recommended approach for\
    \ big datasets. In terms of making predictions and\nclassiﬁcations when using\
    \ unstructured data, supervised DL would be the most suitable\nlearning approach;\
    \ while unsupervised ML or unsupervised DL are the recommended\nCI approaches\
    \ for pattern analysis. Finally, as we can see in Figure 15, the other category\n\
    of problems that users might face is problem-solving. In this case, the user’s\
    \ aim is to\noptimize particular values in order to achieve a desired level of\
    \ performance. As such,\nthe above-suggested approaches are therefore all meta-heuristics\
    \ (e.g., EC, SI, and local\nsearch-based techniques).\nIn addition to the analyses\
    \ presented above, the bottom part of Figure 15 also depicts\nwhich FSC stages\
    \ the four CI modeling approaches (and their associated methods) are\nusually\
    \ applied in. Fuzzy systems and probabilistic approaches are typically considered\
    \ for\ncontrol applications in the production, processing, and retail stages.\
    \ In contrast, optimiza-\ntion with meta-heuristics and prediction-classiﬁcation-pattern\
    \ analysis with ML and DL\nare modeling perspectives that are considered in the\
    \ entire FSC process. The contributions\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n23 of 34\nof\
    \ communication and perception approaches using DL methods tend to be more typically\n\
    focused on the production and retail stages.\n5. Conclusions\nThis ﬁnal section\
    \ introduces the main reﬂections drawn from the research carried out\nin this\
    \ paper. Section 5.1 introduces the summary and conclusions. Then, Section 5.2\
    \ details\na set of challenges and research opportunities to encourage further\
    \ exploration and use of\nthe possible contributions that CI might bring to the\
    \ FSC ﬁeld.\n5.1. Summary\nThis paper has proposed a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\nunder a CI paradigm for three representative supply chains:\
    \ agriculture, ﬁsh farming,\nand livestock. The taxonomy was built based on three\
    \ levels in order to categorize FSC\nproblems according to how they can be modeled\
    \ using CI approaches. The ﬁrst and second\nlevels are focused on identifying\
    \ the chain stage (production, processing, distribution,\nand retail) and the\
    \ speciﬁc FSC problem to be addressed (e.g., vehicle routing problems\nin the\
    \ distribution stage). The third level presents the typologies of FSC problems\
    \ from\na CI perspective, and aims to categorize FSC problems depending on how\
    \ they can be\nmodeled and solved by CI methods. In the third level of the taxonomy\
    \ we have deﬁned\nfour attributes, presented as follows, (1) problem solving,\
    \ which is in charge of classifying\nFSC problems focused on optimizing processes;\
    \ (2) uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nwhich concers problems that have partially\
    \ observable, non-deterministic, incomplete, or\nimprecise data; (3) knowledge\
    \ discovery and function approximation, which has the role\nof categorizing problems\
    \ that aim to make predictions of future scenarios, classiﬁcation of\nvariables,\
    \ or analysis of patterns embedded in data; (4) communication and perception,\n\
    groups FSC problems that involve computer vision systems to sensing and suggesting\n\
    plausible actions to take in order to intervene in such environments.\nTo check\
    \ the robustness of the taxonomy, we categorized FSC problems with CI\nmethods,\
    \ especially in the production, processing, distribution, and retail stages. Here,\
    \ it is\nrelevant to highlight that we introduced a set of uniﬁed deﬁnitions for\
    \ these problems. As\na result, we were able to draw some interesting conclusions.\
    \ In the ﬁsh and livestock cases\nof the production stage, using the DL and the\
    \ communication and perception attribute\nsigniﬁcantly inﬂuences applications\
    \ (e.g., ﬁsh weight estimation, grassland monitoring,\nanimal welfare) where the\
    \ input data is determined by image and video records (non-\nstructured data).\
    \ In contrast, we have the case of classic ML, which is narrowed to FSC\nproblems,\
    \ and for which, the objective is to make production predictions using historical\n\
    data records (structured data). In the case of agriculture production systems,\
    \ the scope of\nthe CI approach is broader. Speciﬁcally, we found that DL, ML,\
    \ FL, and Meta-heuristics are\nmethods for modeling production problems related\
    \ to crop protection and yield, weather\nprediction, and irrigation and nutrient\
    \ management.\nIn the processing stage, ML, meta-heuristics, and probabilistic\
    \ methods are the CI\napproaches commonly used. In terms of ML, the aim is to\
    \ extract patterns and forecast\nobjective variables like demand prediction and\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses. As for\nmeta-heuristics and probabilistic\
    \ techniques, they aim to optimize food manufacturing\nprocesses (e.g., heating,\
    \ drying) and production planning for distribution. Further down\nin the supply\
    \ chain, the predominant family of CI methods is meta-heuristics, found in\nthe\
    \ distribution link. This data-driven approach is devoted to optimizing the routing\n\
    and delivery problems under various constraints such as ﬂeet size and available\
    \ fuel.\nLastly, DL is the principal CI approach in problems with non-structured\
    \ input data (e.g.,\ndynamic discounting, diet, and nutrition) in the retail stage.\
    \ Classical ML has been used to\nextract patterns (food consumption and food waste)\
    \ and predict consumer demand and\nbuying behavior.\nThe taxonomy allowed us to\
    \ ﬁgure out which modeling approaches are more typically\nconsidered when dealing\
    \ with problems at the four supply chain stages. In this manner,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 6910\n24 of 34\nwe gave a general overview of well-established tendencies\
    \ regarding CI across the three\nsupply chains considered. Thus, the deﬁnition\
    \ and classiﬁcation of FSC problems helped\nus introduce guidelines for the incorporation\
    \ and use of CI in the food industry. These\nguidelines are built upon CI’s primary\
    \ purposes in the food supply chain: communication\nand perception, uncertain\
    \ knowledge and reasoning representations, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving. These guidelines aim to help non-expert\nCI users to identify\
    \ families of methods that can supply a solution for their particular CI-\nbased\
    \ needs in different FSC problems.\nIn summary, the taxonomy analysis suggests\
    \ that there is no family of CI methods\nthat best suits all FSC problems. However,\
    \ we state the need for a comparison framework\nthat allows the description and\
    \ analysis of the performance of different CI methods in\ndiverse supply chain\
    \ problems. In this context, the taxonomy presented sets up the basis\nfor a common\
    \ framework that, in further research, will facilitate experimentation in order\n\
    to determine which CI approaches are more appropriate for each type of FSC problem.\n\
    This may also help determine a suitable baseline of methods to make fair comparisons,\n\
    depending on the family of CI methods chosen for the FSC problem at hand.\n5.2.\
    \ Challenges and Research Opportunities\nAs industry 4.0 is ﬂourishing for the\
    \ FSC management and operation, emerging re-\nsearch paths arise for CI to yield\
    \ more robust, interoperable, and accurate methods [145,146].\nTherefore, this\
    \ section points out challenges and research opportunities that the community\n\
    should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nThese challenges are motivated by the gaps located at the intersection\
    \ of FSC and CI, which\nwere identiﬁed through the proposed taxonomy.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Data Fusion from Different Data Sources\nSigniﬁcantly, few CI methods can incorporate\
    \ data from different types of sources.\nBesides, in real scenarios, the data\
    \ available from a unique type of sensor might not be\nsufﬁcient to fully represent\
    \ the FSC problem that is intended to be addressed. For instance,\ndifferent Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., agricultural environment monitoring sys-\ntems,\
    \ GPS, cameras) provide diverse data for the optimum management of production\n\
    systems [147–149]. Amongst the relevant data for the aforementioned example, we\
    \ ﬁnd\ntemperature, humidity, localization coordinates, crop images, and others.\n\
    As a common denominator, all the data associated with the aforementioned variables\n\
    can have a different format, ranging from historical records in the form of tables,\
    \ to non-\nstructured data like images. Additionally, all of them offer valuable\
    \ information for the\npurpose at hand (e.g., prediction of crop production or\
    \ management of pest diseases). In\nthis context, the challenge lies in deﬁning\
    \ guidelines for the harmonizing and fusion of\ndata from diverse sources. Such\
    \ guidelines should consider that each FSC stage can add\nparticularities to the\
    \ data for the CI-based problem under consideration. How to properly\ncollect\
    \ and generate a single dataset with information obtained from varied and different\n\
    sources, which are fed into a CI method, is a research opportunity that must be\
    \ addressed\nto further enhance CI contributions in the FSC domain.\nIf the integration\
    \ process is not done correctly, inconsistencies will appear, resulting in\na\
    \ decrease in the performance of CI approaches [150]. Hence, merging data from\
    \ different\ninput sources presents a notorious problem that commonly attracts\
    \ more issues, such as\ninconsistent, duplicate, redundant, and correlated data.\
    \ One potential research direction\nto take to help cope with this challenge could\
    \ be designing automatic preprocessing\napproaches that fuse and harmonize data\
    \ sources to provide the accepted input format\nof CI methods. For the latter,\
    \ it is important to note that every CI approach requires\ndifferent input data\
    \ formats, which could split the design of the aforementioned automatic\ndata\
    \ preprocessing methods into diverse paths depending on the particular family\
    \ of CI\nmethods under consideration.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n25 of 34\n5.2.2.\
    \ Real-Time Data and Incremental Learning\nIn supervised learning, the input data\
    \ is available before starting any training pro-\ncesses. Here, the task is to\
    \ build up a model from that data using a batch approach. The\nlatter means that\
    \ DL and ML methods use all available samples in the input data to build\nand\
    \ train a model to make predictions or classiﬁcations when new data comes into\
    \ the\ntrained model. Currently, most DL and ML applications are focused on the\
    \ batch learning\napproach, wherein data are given before training the ML models\
    \ [151]. In this context,\nmodel training and optimization processes are purely\
    \ based on the aforementioned in-\nput dataset, whose data distribution is supposed\
    \ to be static. Nevertheless, such a static\napproach is not the case for real\
    \ CI-based applications within the FSC.\nDL and ML methods must real FSC scenarios,\
    \ wherein different IoT devices continu-\nously generate new data streams. For\
    \ instance, dynamic discounts in the retail stage or the\nmanagement of greenhouse\
    \ systems whose conditions must be constantly monitored to\nguarantee the optimal\
    \ control of crops are examples of real-time data streams. Therefore,\nthe key\
    \ challenge is to design ML and DL methods that adapt to real-time data, and work\n\
    with limited resources (e.g., memory), while maintaining their predictive capacities.\n\
    Further research is needed to deal with the aforementioned challenge, and should\n\
    include the concepts of incremental learning [152,153] in the design and deployment\
    \ of\nDL and ML methods in FSC problems. Furthermore, although incremental learning\
    \ is a\nsuitable strategy when dealing with the adaptation of DL and ML to real-time\
    \ data streams,\nthe concept of incremental learning brings up other issues that\
    \ must be considered when it\nis included in the FSC context. These issues are\
    \ introduced in more detail below.\nThe ﬁrst issue is related to the concept of\
    \ drift, which is associated with changes in\nthe new input data’s statistical\
    \ properties (e.g., statistical distribution), which can highly\ninﬂuence the\
    \ performance of pre-trained DL or ML methods [154]. Secondly, we have\nthe stability-plasticity\
    \ dilemma that, in noisy environments, refers to when and how to\nadapt the current\
    \ model to the new data stream [155]. On the one hand, quick updates\nenable fast\
    \ adaptations of the model according to new data; however, at the same time, old\n\
    information that could be useful later in the process is forgotten just as quickly.\
    \ On the\nother hand, slow adaptations can be made, and old data is retained longer,\
    \ causing the\nmodel’s reactivity capacity to decrease; thereby, affecting the\
    \ model’s forecasting power.\nThus, deﬁning policies to balance the two scenarios\
    \ mentioned above is a relevant challenge\nto support the inclusion of CI approaches\
    \ in real-time data environments.\nFinally, the third challenge associated with\
    \ incremental learning is adaptive model\ncomplexity [156]. This issue is concerned\
    \ with the fact that as concept drift events become\nmore frequent, increasing\
    \ model complexity is required. Although the latter improves the\nmodel’s performance,\
    \ increasing its complexity leads to an increase in the need of more\ncomputational\
    \ resources, which are not always affordable or available in different domains,\n\
    such as FSC.\n5.2.3. Explainability of Computational Intelligence Methods\nNowadays,\
    \ CI systems have increased their capacity to carry out different tasks (e.g.,\n\
    predictions, classiﬁcation) with almost no human intervention and are achieving\
    \ high\nproﬁciency levels. In a narrow scope, if the only objective when evaluating\
    \ CI methods is\nperformance, such an object has clearly been achieved thanks\
    \ to this increasing capacity.\nNonetheless, when decisions derived from CI-based\
    \ techniques affect the dynamics of hu-\nman life (e.g., social, cultural, environmental\
    \ dimensions), understanding how CI systems\nhave achieved this performance becomes\
    \ necessary [157].\nWhile some CI approaches, such as fuzzy logic and ML methods\
    \ (e.g., rule-based\nlearners, decision trees), can provide different degrees\
    \ of interpretability and transparency\nof decisions made in their inner structure;\
    \ other methods cannot provide this information\n(e.g., black-box decision systems\
    \ [158]). In these cases, there are no clues regarding the\nsystems’ decisions\
    \ to obtain the ﬁnal result. One example is DL methods, whose complex\ninner structure\
    \ is full of intricate connections between layers and neurons and have a broad\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n26 of 34\nspace of hyperparameters. Therefore, understanding\
    \ where the high performance of DL\nmethods comes from is quite tricky.\nAs DL\
    \ is increasingly being employed in diverse FSC applications due to its per-\n\
    formance capacities, the demand for interpretability, explainability, and transparency\
    \ is\ngrowing between diverse FSC stakeholders. Such demand lies in the fact that\
    \ decisions\nmade based on CI systems can lead to actions, which can not be justiﬁed\
    \ or that require\ndetailed explanations [159] in order to enhance the management\
    \ of the supply chain. For\nexample, the shelf-life of perishable products needs\
    \ to be predicted in the distribution\nstage. However, understanding the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence the deterioration or preservation\nof food products is vital to\
    \ improve the management of distribution chains. The latter is\nknown as explainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI) and is widely acknowledged as a crucial\nconcept\
    \ to be taken into account in the practical deployment of CI methods [160].\n\
    In this sense, as stated by [160], the challenge of XAI in different knowledge\
    \ domains,\nsuch as FSCs, is creating more explainable methods while maintaining\
    \ their output perfor-\nmance. Besides, it is crucial to facilitate stakeholder\
    \ understanding and trust in decisions\nsupported by CI systems whose outputs\
    \ become the basis for different actions along the\nwhole supply chain.\n5.2.4.\
    \ The Method Selection Problem\nAs shown in this research paper, depending on\
    \ the FSC problem at hand, different\ntypes of CI methods could be used. In this\
    \ sense, Section 4 provides helpful information\nto guide non-expert CI users\
    \ when choosing the most suitable CI family of methods\ndepending on the purpose\
    \ to be pursued (e.g., prediction, classiﬁcation, optimization). In\nthis context,\
    \ keeping in mind the no-free-lunch theorem [161] (which states that there is\n\
    no unique algorithm that can be competitive in all problems), the proposed guidelines\n\
    contribute to dealing with the model selection problem in the FSC area. Nevertheless,\n\
    having identiﬁed the most suitable families of CI methods, it is still difﬁcult\
    \ to choose the\nbest method within each family.\nFor instance, if the objective\
    \ is to optimize a food production process in the processing\nstage, the critical\
    \ question would be to ask what meta-heuristic approach is the most\nsuitable\
    \ for the considered problem. The answer to this question could be to use an\n\
    EC, SI, or local-based approach. However, solving such a decision requires a thorough\n\
    experimentation that demands a large amount of effort and is time-consuming [162].\n\
    Another similar example of the method selection problem is the case of ML. FSC\
    \ data\nallows different variables of interest to be predicted under diverse scenarios,\
    \ ranging from\nﬁsh farming production to agriculture. These characteristics of\
    \ the production context\ninﬂuence ML method performance, and selecting the most\
    \ appropriate method from a\npool of candidates is a time-consuming task. Thus,\
    \ the automation of choosing the best CI\ntechnique from a predeﬁned set of methods\
    \ of the same family is a crucial challenge that\ncould help increase inclusion\
    \ of CI into the FSC.\nCurrently, there are well-established automated approaches\
    \ focused on ML and DL.\nTherefore, we can use the automation of complete ML or\
    \ DL workﬂows, known as Auto-\nmated Machine learning (AutoML) [163] and Automated\
    \ Deep learning (AutoDL) [164].\nSuch approaches are considered to be promising\
    \ strategies to reduce human effort and\ntime cost of ML and DL in research areas\
    \ in which specialized knowledge is an asset\nthat is not always available or\
    \ affordable. Particularly, AutoML and AutoDL seek to ﬁnd\ncompetitive ML pipelines\
    \ (the workﬂow from data preprocessing to model selection) and\nneural network\
    \ architectures automatically without almost any human intervention. The\ncentral\
    \ purpose is maximizing or minimizing a performance metric on input data without\n\
    it having to be specialized in the problem domain where the data comes.\nAutoML\
    \ and AutoDL methods have been successfully used in other areas [165,166].\nHowever,\
    \ an extensive analysis to determine their strengths and weaknesses has not been\n\
    carried out in very diverse learning tasks, such as FSCs. Additionally, the concept\
    \ of\nAutoML and AutoDL could be extrapolated to an even broader space, such as\
    \ automated\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n27 of 34\ncomputational intelligence. In\
    \ this case, the focus would be on supporting non-expert\nusers in selecting other\
    \ CI techniques like meta-heuristics and its sub-families (e.g., EC,\nSI, local-based\
    \ approaches). In this context, the research challenge lies in the design and\n\
    development of automated methods for other families of CI methods, including fuzzy\n\
    logic, meta-heuristic, probabilistic methods, and others.\n5.2.5. Interoperability\
    \ and Deployment of CI with Information and\nCommunication Technologies\nCI is\
    \ only one part of the entire ICT ecosystem required to digitize processes in\
    \ the\nFSC. IoT technologies, information storage and management technologies,\
    \ data analytic\nand visualization tools, or decision support technologies are\
    \ other relevant components\nwithout which CI cannot reach its full potential.\
    \ All these technologies have switched the\nfocus from traditional automation\
    \ of FSC processes to a cloud-based paradigm where all\nICTs operate efﬁciently\
    \ and intuitively [167]. Within the cloud-based approaches, major\ntechnologies\
    \ must be able to interoperate with each other and themselves. Thus, such\ninterconnectivity\
    \ and exchange of information are some of the main challenges raised\nwhen incorporating\
    \ CI and other industry 4.0 approaches into the daily operation and\nmanagement\
    \ of FSCs [168].\nOne of the latent issues is the lack of standardization of the\
    \ data models with CI\nmethods. Ultimately the goal of Industry 4.0 in FSCs is\
    \ to incorporate semantic interoper-\nability, which enables systems to exchange\
    \ information with unambiguous meaning [169].\nHowever, the study of interoperability\
    \ standards for CI approaches is a research area that\nstill needs to be fully\
    \ exploited. The demand for these standards is also growing at a\npace never seen\
    \ before, as the current trend of Industry 4.0 is characterized by complex\nautomation\
    \ and production systems where CI works with a wide variety of standards,\ncomponents,\
    \ and services in a cloud-based environment [170]. Despite such challenges, re-\n\
    cent advances have been made in interoperability standards for cloud-based environments.\n\
    Some examples are the interoperable cloud-based manufacturing system [171], the\
    \ hybrid\nmanufacturing cloud framework [172], and the new generation artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence-driven\nintelligent manufacturing architecture [173].\nAnother\
    \ big challenge of CI in integration with ICTs lies in the manufacturing pro-\n\
    cesses of the FSC production stage. Nowadays, CI approaches are usually focused\
    \ on\nmaximizing accuracy without considering the resources they consume. Nevertheless,\
    \ with\nthe increasing demand of developing a globally low carbon economy, the\
    \ need to build an\nintelligent and environmentally friendly food industry is\
    \ becoming more urgent [174,175].\nIn this sense, CI approaches require that a\
    \ balance be struck between the computational\nresources they use, the energy\
    \ they consume, and the performance they can achieve in the\ntime-frame allowed\
    \ by food manufacturing processes [176]. Furthermore, the aforemen-\ntioned resources\
    \ are assets that are not always available in small- and medium-sized food\nindustries.\
    \ Therefore, more research is required to develop CI methods that are capable\n\
    of being deployed in IoT devices and smart manufacturing industries under different\n\
    constraints like energy efﬁciency and computational resources. In conclusion,\
    \ this research\npath could imply bringing in the concepts of edge computing and\
    \ fog computing [177] for\nthe efﬁcient inclusion of CI in food manufacturing\
    \ processes [178].\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S.A.-Z., A.A.-V.\

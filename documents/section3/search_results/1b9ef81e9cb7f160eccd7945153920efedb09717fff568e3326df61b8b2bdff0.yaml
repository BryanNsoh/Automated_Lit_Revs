    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\

    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    \ massive smart devices to collect big data and carry\nout the monitoring and\
    \ control of numerous things in cyber-physical systems (CPS). By leveraging\n\
    machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze the collected\
    \ data, physical\nsystems can be monitored and controlled effectively. Along with\
    \ the development of IoT and data\nanalysis technologies, a number of CPS (smart\
    \ grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart\ncities, etc.) adopt\
    \ IoT and data analysis technologies to improve their performance and operations.\n\
    Nonetheless, directly manipulating or updating the real system has inherent risks.\
    \ Thus, creating a\ndigital clone of a real physical system, denoted as a Digital\
    \ Twin (DT), is a viable strategy. Generally\nspeaking, a DT is a data-driven\
    \ software and hardware emulation platform, which is a cyber replica\nof physical\
    \ systems. Meanwhile, a DT describes a speciﬁc physical system and tends to achieve\n\
    the functions and use cases of physical systems. Since DT is a complex digital\
    \ system, ﬁnding\na way to effectively represent a variety of things in timely\
    \ and efﬁcient manner poses numerous\nchallenges to the networking, computing,\
    \ and data analytics for IoT. Furthermore, the design of\na DT for IoT systems\
    \ must consider numerous exceptional requirements (e.g., latency, reliability,\n\
    safety, scalability, security, and privacy). To address such challenges, the thoughtful\
    \ design of DTs\noffers opportunities for novel and interdisciplinary research\
    \ efforts. To address the aforementioned\nproblems and issues, in this paper,\
    \ we ﬁrst review the architectures of DTs, data representation,\nand communication\
    \ protocols. We then review existing efforts on applying DT into IoT data-driven\n\
    smart systems, including the smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities.\nFurther, we summarize the existing challenges from CPS, data\
    \ science, optimization, and security and\nprivacy perspectives. Finally, we outline\
    \ possible future research directions from the perspectives of\nperformance, new\
    \ DT-driven services, model and learning, and security and privacy.\nKeywords:\
    \ Digital Twin; Internet of Things (IoT); cyber-physical systems; smart-world\
    \ applications\n1. Introduction\nThe technological trend of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has led to a massive increase\nin the number of smart devices that are\
    \ connected to cyberspace [1–3]. In order for these\nsmart devices to make a meaningful\
    \ impact, it is important that they have the capability\nof capturing information\
    \ related to their intended use; some common information that\nwould be captured\
    \ from typical smart devices may include trafﬁc ﬂows, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and energy consumption. Depending on what a smart device is designed for,\n\
    it may capture the key characteristics of things so that the efﬁciency and intelligence\
    \ of\ncyber-physical systems (CPS), including energy, transportation, manufacturing,\
    \ agriculture,\nhealthcare, and other critical infrastructure systems, can be\
    \ realized [4–14]. Due to the\nlarge number of data points that are introduced\
    \ in these CPS, it is important to adopt\nadvanced networking, data analysis (e.g.,\
    \ deep learning), and cloud/edge computing\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64. https://doi.org/10.3390/ﬁ14020064\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n2 of\
    \ 25\ntechnologies in smart systems [15–21]. By doing this, the relevant information\
    \ can be\ncollected, transmitted, analyzed, and shared in a timely manner so that\
    \ usable information\ncan provide the intelligence to enhance the monitoring and\
    \ control abilities of physical\nsystems [22].\nAs an energy-based CPS, the smart\
    \ grid can be identiﬁed as a complex system, where\nnumerous uncertainties arise\
    \ in both cyber and physical components [23–26]. The uncer-\ntainties can be caused\
    \ by an outage in one part of the grid; in other words, the smart grid\nis susceptible\
    \ and is easily affected by random accidents such as power load imbalance,\noutages,\
    \ and even disruption from surrounding environments. We can understate both\n\
    the importance and frangibility of the smart grid, which is facing unprecedented\
    \ chal-\nlenges. Depending on the development of big data and IoT, adapting big\
    \ data analysis\ntools (ML/DL, data mining, statistics, etc.) can predict some\
    \ potential risks, in order to\nmitigate accidents in the smart grid [27]. Furthermore,\
    \ leveraging big data can establish\na virtual smart grid environment to simulate\
    \ real accidents, to investigate and develop\nmitigation plans.\nAnother example\
    \ is related to wireless sensors networks, which can be used in different\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring systems. For example, smart farming is an emerging application\n\
    that connects IoT devices so that agricultural production, soil quality, and temperature\n\
    humidity can be managed [12,28,29]. Due to the harsh weather and environments,\
    \ there are\nnumerous uncertainties that could affect the reliability of connectivity\
    \ and physical devices\nin smart farming. The uncertainties of the smart farming\
    \ system can cause failures and\nlead to the quantity and quality reduction of\
    \ agricultural products. Thus, it is necessary\nto design and implement the smart\
    \ farming system as a typical CPS in the agriculture\ndomain so that important\
    \ data can be collected and efﬁcient operations of smart farms can\nbe supported.\
    \ To this end, leveraging the collected data to create a cyber replica of the\n\
    farming system for testing and evaluation is a feasible approach to deal with\
    \ a variety of\nuncertainties in the system.\nLikewise, in smart manufacturing\
    \ systems, leveraging big data analysis can help\nsystem administrators and engineers\
    \ discover vulnerabilities in the system. In addition,\nbased on big data analysis,\
    \ system administrators and engineers can update systems\nto optimize supply chain\
    \ and production performance [7,30,31]. Nonetheless, directly\nmanipulating or\
    \ updating the real system has some critical risks. Thus, creating a cyber\nreplica\
    \ of real physical systems to emulate real cases in those physical systems is\
    \ an efﬁcient\nstrategy, which is named Digital Twin (DT).\nGenerally speaking,\
    \ DT is a digital clone of a real physical system. The vision of DT\nrefers to\
    \ data-driven software and hardware set that describes a real physical system\
    \ with all\nfunctions and use cases. It also includes all status and information\
    \ in life-cycle phases [32].\nWith obvious beneﬁts, integrating DT into CPS could\
    \ pose numerous challenges to mod-\neling, computing, networking, and data analysis,\
    \ alongside the exceptional requirements\nof CPS with respect to latency, reliability,\
    \ safety, scalability, security, and privacy, among\nothers. While advanced networking,\
    \ computing, and data analysis technologies can help\nthe realization of DT, there\
    \ are a number of issues that need to be addressed, including\nhow to deﬁne the\
    \ theoretical foundation and modeling techniques such that DT accurately\nand\
    \ reliably reﬂect the states of things, how to design ML/DL models to achieve\
    \ real-time\nbig data processing, and and how to secure DT and protect privacy-sensitive\
    \ information\ncollection and publishing.\nThere are some existing studies that\
    \ have proposed feasible approaches, such as\nleveraging multi-domain and multi-level\
    \ designs in manufacturing systems; that is, designs\nbased on different sub-system\
    \ digital abstractions in different domains, and designs based\non the principal\
    \ structures of real physical systems at different levels [33]. In order to\n\
    ensure that DT can represent the physical systems precisely, the multi-domain\
    \ and multi-\nlevel design process must accompany the life-cycle of real physical\
    \ systems. In addition,\nsome existing surveys summarize existing DT efforts that\
    \ are designed to emulate real\nphysical systems. For example, there are several\
    \ existing surveys focusing on inspecting\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n3 of\
    \ 25\nthe framework of DT in industrial systems [30,34–36]. Additionally, some\
    \ studies have\nfocused on categorizing different DTs in the power grid [37–40].\
    \ Nonetheless, since IoT is\nwidely applied to different physical systems, it\
    \ is necessary to conduct a comprehensive\ninvestigation of extending DTs to IoT-based\
    \ smart systems driven by data science and\nengineering. Furthermore, based on\
    \ new techniques, the challenges and future research\ndirections for DT need to\
    \ be discussed.\nTo address the aforementioned problems and issues, we make the\
    \ following contribu-\ntions in this study.\n•\nWe begin with the architecture\
    \ design of existing DTs, which includes DT variants,\nDT sub-types, and IoT-based\
    \ DT. We then review the data representation and com-\nmunication protocols for\
    \ DT. In addition, we present the use cases for applying DT\ninto a variety of\
    \ smart-world systems, which include smart grid, smart transportation,\nsmart\
    \ city, and smart manufacturing, as typical CPS.\n•\nBased on the architecture\
    \ and its applications to smart-world systems, we discuss chal-\nlenges that arise\
    \ from four perspectives: CPS, data science, optimization, and security\nand privacy.\
    \ We also present several research directions for DT that we strongly feel\nneed\
    \ further research, including performance, new DT-driven services, modeling and\n\
    machine learning, and security and privacy.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized\
    \ as follows: In Section 2, we provide the\nhistorical background of DT, including\
    \ the key concepts, techniques, architecture, and\nprotocols of DT. In Section\
    \ 3, we review the examples of applying DT into smart-world\nsystems, including\
    \ smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart cities\nas\
    \ case study. In Section 4, we present the challenges of DT from the perspectives\
    \ of CPS,\ndata science, optimization, and security and privacy. In Section 5,\
    \ we outline possible\nfuture research directions from the perspectives of performance,\
    \ new DT-driven services,\nmodeling and machine learning, and security and privacy.\
    \ Finally, we summarize the paper\nin Section 6.\n2. Digital Twin\nIn this section,\
    \ we review the basic concepts and architecture of DT, as well as data\nrepresentation\
    \ and communication protocols for enabling DT.\n2.1. Basic Concepts\nA DT system\
    \ can be regarded as a replica of a target physical system. It leverages\na model\
    \ to continuously simulate different functions of physical systems. In order to\n\
    accomplish this, the DT must have a connection with the target physical entity\
    \ so that the\nstate of physical things can be collected and updated. Thus, a\
    \ DT model can be used to\npredict, control, or optimize the functionality of\
    \ things while at the same time learning\nfrom things that it represents. Note\
    \ that the function of a DT is more than just simulation; it\ncan interact with\
    \ the physical system so that it can adapt to environmental changes.\nDT technology\
    \ relies heavily on the ability of ingesting large amounts of data and\ndrawing\
    \ conclusions on their correlation. Because of this, DT is closely tied with big\n\
    modeling driven by advanced ML/DL and big data analytic techniques so that real-time\n\
    forecasting and prediction can be achieved. For example, by leveraging DT in manufac-\n\
    turing processes, we can plan repair and maintenance activities, which could eliminate\n\
    failures from the manufacturing process. In order to obtain this seamless integration\
    \ of DT\nand physical systems, it is critical that the DT obtains the real-time\
    \ state information of\nphysical systems (i.e., sharing a connection to data);\
    \ this is realized by using IoT sensors\nand networking technologies.\nSimulation\
    \ technology has been evolving for several decades and is most commonly\nused\
    \ in Computer Aided Design (CAD), where a simulation of a system can gather insight\n\
    for a possible conclusion to a speciﬁc scenario. DT improves on this technology\
    \ by intro-\nducing ML/DL engines to interpret data that can interact with the\
    \ physical system. This\nimportant distinction between traditional simulations\
    \ and DT is made possible through\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n4 of 25\nthe\
    \ use of sensors, communication networks, data aggregation, and analysis, as well\
    \ as\ncost-effective and intelligent decision core, which can interpret the process\
    \ and provide\nreal-time feedback to the system.\n2.2. Architecture\nGenerally\
    \ speaking, DT can be divided into three parts: the physical system, the digital\n\
    system, and the connection between them. Figure 1 illustrates the general architecture\
    \ of a\nDT. The physical system represents any actual system in the real world,\
    \ including smart\ngrid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart\
    \ cities. The physical system can\nprovide service to multiple users. Nonetheless,\
    \ the environment may change when the\nphysical system operates. In this case,\
    \ the physical system needs to take action to handle\nthis change. Nonetheless,\
    \ it can be difﬁcult to update a real physical model based on a\ncomplex operating\
    \ procedure. Under such a circumstance, the DT can leverage a simpliﬁed\nphysical\
    \ system and, using the data from the new environment, perform simulation and\n\
    guide the physical system to perform the next step.\nFigure 1. DT Architecture.\n\
    2.2.1. DT Variants\nBased on different types of data sharing between physical\
    \ and digital systems, we can\ncategorize DT into three variants: Digital Model,\
    \ Digital Shadow, and Digital Twin (DT).\nFigure 2 represents the architecture\
    \ of these DT variants.\nFigure 2. DT Variants.\nGenerally speaking, digital modeling\
    \ refers to a digital representation of one existing\nphysical system or its theoretical\
    \ model. The digital representation of the system may\nFuture Internet 2022, 14,\
    \ 64\n5 of 25\ninclude a detailed description of the physical components. A distinct\
    \ difference is that\na true DT system would utilize the data collected from the\
    \ physical system to build a\ndigital system for simulation and control of the\
    \ physical system based on the simulation\nresults. Nonetheless, for digital models,\
    \ digital systems cannot automatically manipulate\nphysical systems based on digital\
    \ system simulation results [30,41]. Changes to the physical\nrepresentation will\
    \ not affect the digital representation and vice versa.\nTo expand on the modeling\
    \ capabilities of the digital model, the Digital Shadow\nfurther takes the simulation\
    \ and integrates a one-way data ﬂow from the physical object to\nthe digital representation\
    \ [42]. Changes to the state of the physical systems can dynamically\nalter the\
    \ representation of the digital model based on changing states in the physical\
    \ system.\nThis type of digital modeling can be used as a virtual representation\
    \ of the physical system.\nIn this way, the system administrator can intuitively\
    \ observe the operation of the physical\nsystem and can respond in time according\
    \ to the existing problems of the system. Changes\nto the physical system can\
    \ have impacts on the virtual model but not vice versa.\nThe DT is an extension\
    \ of the digital model and digital shadow. The distinct difference\nbetween the\
    \ two previous examples and a DT system is the two-way link between the\nphysical\
    \ system and the digital model. One beneﬁt of having the two-way link is the ability\n\
    to affect the physical system based on the digital representation. Changes in\
    \ the physical\nsystem can be reﬂected over the digital model so that possible\
    \ outcomes based on system\nvariables can be output. The link back to the physical\
    \ system allows the control system to\ninteract with the physical system so that\
    \ a desired outcome can be achieved.\n2.2.2. Types of DT\nIn addition to the three\
    \ variants mentioned above, the DT can be categorized into four\ntypes: DT prototype\
    \ (DTP) [43], DT instance (DTI) [44], DT aggregation (DTA) [45], and DT\nenvironment\
    \ (DTE) [44–46]. Figures 3 and 4 represent the architecture of DT types and DT\n\
    environment, respectively.\nFigure 3. DT types.\nFigure 4. DT environment.\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2022, 14, 64\n6 of 25\nThe DTP represents a type of DT framework that\
    \ leverages all the information from\nthe physical system, which is necessary\
    \ to reproduce the system in the physical world.\nThe data ﬂow transfers from\
    \ the physical system to the digital system. The purpose of\nDTP is to improve\
    \ the time and cost efﬁciency of the operation of the physical system.\nDTP can\
    \ be used in monitoring systems, such as smart grid monitoring systems. However,\n\
    the DTP data ﬂow is a one-way ﬂow from the physical system to the digital system.\
    \ It can\nonly monitor the system and cannot manage it according to the incoming\
    \ data from the\nphysical system.\nThe DTI is a type of DT that connects to its\
    \ corresponding physical target. Unlike\nthe DTP, the DTI handles the data ﬂow\
    \ from the digital system to the physical system.\nThe data ﬂow contains predictions\
    \ or guidelines, which assist the physical system to\noperate simultaneously when\
    \ the environment changes. With both DTP and DTI, the two-\nway connection between\
    \ the physical system and digital system has been established.\nNonetheless, the\
    \ DTI only represents a single data ﬂow from the digital system to the\nphysical\
    \ system. In this case, another term, called DTA, has been proposed to represent\n\
    the aggregation of all the DTIs. DTI/DTA can be used to manage systems as data\
    \ ﬂows\nfrom digital systems to physical systems. The operator can operate the\
    \ physical system\naccording to the prediction result of the physical system.\
    \ Nonetheless, the DTI/DTA\ndata ﬂow cannot be transferred directly from the physical\
    \ system to the digital system.\nAdditional mechanisms need to be implemented\
    \ to retrieve information from the physical\nsystem to enable the DT to operate.\n\
    The DTE (DT environment) can be considered as the boundary of the DT application.\n\
    One DTE can contain multiple DT systems. The DTE is responsible for managing all\
    \ the\nDT systems under its coverage to assist in the operation of the relevant\
    \ physical systems.\nFrom the application point of view, DTE can be used to manage\
    \ large systems. At the\nsame time, a synchronization mechanism needs to be implemented\
    \ to speed up the query\nprocessing among multiple digital systems.\n2.2.3. Architecture\
    \ for IoT Systems\nAs massive numbers of IoT devices have been implemented across\
    \ a variety of real-\nworld applications and physical locations, and the collection,\
    \ aggregation, storage, and anal-\nysis of their generated data is a prodigious\
    \ challenge. Figure 5 illustrates a generic architec-\nture for IoT systems [47],\
    \ which consists of four layers (i.e., object layer, communication\nlayer, application\
    \ layer, and end-user layer).\nFigure 5. DT architecture for IoT.\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2022, 14, 64\n7 of 25\nThe object layer represents all IoT sensors and is used\
    \ to provide data and information\nfor different IoT-driven applications. It contains\
    \ all the components that make up the\nphysical system. The communication layer\
    \ provides communication network infrastructure\nto collect IoT devices and collect\
    \ data for DT. For example, a number of edge gateways can\nbe deployed to collect\
    \ and aggregate information from sensors and send the information\nto the application\
    \ layer. IoT sensors and gateways use different communication protocols\nto collect\
    \ and transmit information. After the gateway in the object layer obtains the\n\
    information, it transmits the data to the application layer. The application layer\
    \ includes\nthe digital systems of DT. At this level, the DT system ﬁrst maps\
    \ all sensor and gateway\ninformation to the digital system. At the same time,\
    \ we can use the IoT naming service\nto name the mapped IoT sensors and local\
    \ gateways, so that the digital system can locate\ndifferent resources [48]. The\
    \ digital system can then use ML/DL models to perform\nprediction and analysis.\
    \ By doing so, the digital system can control the actuators in the\ntarget layer\
    \ based on the prediction results. Furthermore, the prediction and analysis\n\
    results can provide different services in the end-user layer. The end-user layer\
    \ provides\nservices for users, who can send requests to the application layer.\
    \ After that, the digital\nsystem will analyze the information obtained and respond\
    \ with the results accordingly.\nBased on the architecture of the DT system, data\
    \ representation and communication\nprotocols are essential for data sharing within\
    \ the DT, as well the provisioning of services\nto end users.\n2.3. Data Representation\n\
    Data representation enables components to understand data from different domains\
    \ [49–51].\nSeveral commonly used data representation protocols in DT are DT Deﬁnition\
    \ Language\n(DTDL) [52], FIWARE [53], OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (OPC UA) [54,55],\
    \ and Feature-Based\nDT Framework (FDTF) [56]. In particular, DTDL is an open-standard\
    \ platform proposed by\nMicrosoft [52], which can realize data transmission within\
    \ the system or between different\nsystems. The summary of data representation\
    \ protocols is listed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Protocols of DTs.\nProtocol Name\n\
    Protocol Type\nProtocol Characteristics\nDTDL\nData Representation\nAs an open-standard\
    \ platform, it deﬁnes six characteristics\nof IoT components and enables seamless\
    \ data transmission\nbetween different DTs.\nFIWARE\nData Representation\nIt supports\
    \ DT data transmission and the processing of con-\ntextual information received\
    \ from various IoT components.\nOPC UA\nData Representation\nAs a modeling framework,\
    \ it can retrieve information from\nraw data, support data manipulation, and provide\
    \ monitor-\ning capabilities.\nFDTF\nData Representation\nAs a DT structure, it\
    \ enables the DT system to share informa-\ntion based on the data link between\
    \ DT components.\nCoAP\nCommunication\nAs a specialized web communication protocol\
    \ based on the\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP), it is tailored for resource-\nrestricted\
    \ devices, supports the transmission of data via Hy-\npertext Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP), and provides a publish and\nsubscribe mechanism to simplify the process\
    \ of obtaining\ncontinuous data from the sensor.\nMQTT\nCommunication\nAs a communication\
    \ protocol based on Transmission Con-\ntrol Protocol (TCP), it enables lightweight\
    \ way for IoT\ndevices to communicate, provides reliable data transfer,\nand can\
    \ establish a long-existing outgoing TCP protocol\nto enable transmission.\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2022, 14, 64\n8 of 25\nTable 1. Cont.\nProtocol Name\nProtocol Type\n\
    Protocol Characteristics\nModbus TCP/IP\nCommunication\nAs a communication protocol\
    \ based on Transmission Control\nProtocol (TCP), it realizes the connection between\
    \ industrial\ndevices, provides reliable data transfer, and contains built-in\n\
    checksum protection.\nURLLC\nCommunication\nAs a communication protocol, it tends\
    \ to achieve low la-\ntency and reliability in the transmission process between\n\
    IoT devices.\nDTDL [52] deﬁnes the following six characteristics of IoT components:\
    \ (i) Interface: the\nbasic information of a component (device ID, device type,\
    \ display content, etc.). Different\ninterfaces can inherit attributes from parent\
    \ interfaces (e.g., charging station components\ncan inherit some attributes of\
    \ the parking lot such as addresses); (ii) Telemetry: the data sent\nfrom any\
    \ component in the IoT-based DT (the raw data from IoT sensors, the processed\n\
    data generated by DT models, etc.); (iii) Property: the status of the components\
    \ in the\nIoT-based DT (i.e., the device is read-only or read-write). This can\
    \ also include the different\nstates between different DT (whether the data between\
    \ the two DTs are consistent, etc.); (iv)\nCommand: operations that any DT can\
    \ understand; (v) Relationship: the connection between\nthe DTs (e.g., the relationship\
    \ between the house and the cleaner is cleaned up); and (vi)\nComponent: the entities\
    \ that exist in the DT, including sensors, gateways, and digital systems.\nBased\
    \ upon these six components, DTDL can be composed of multiple DTs with a uniﬁed\n\
    structure and data, which enables seamless data transmission between different\
    \ DTs.\nFIWARE [53] is also an open-source project designed to support DT data\
    \ transmis-\nsion and the processing of contextual information received from various\
    \ IoT components.\nFIWARE developed a data modeling standard called FIWARE NGSI\
    \ that describes the\ncollection, processing, and change notiﬁcation operations\
    \ of contextual information. FI-\nWARE NGSI is an object-oriented data protocol\
    \ that uses context objects to represent\nphysical/digital objects. NGSI provides\
    \ a data model that enables data exchange between\nmultiple DTs. It also uses\
    \ NGSI-LD to represent the relationship between different objects\nand uses JSON-LD\
    \ for encoding to unify the data format.\nOPC UA [54,55] is a modeling framework\
    \ that can retrieve information from raw\ndata. OPC UA deﬁnes the data transmission\
    \ and understanding model between different\nsystems. It also has a mechanism\
    \ to traverse all data and analyze its semantics. OPC UA\nsupports data manipulation\
    \ to make it easier to manage data under the DT architecture.\nFurthermore, it\
    \ provides monitoring capabilities, enabling the DT system to manage the\nstate\
    \ of all sensors under the control.\nFDTF [56] is a DT structure that enables\
    \ the DT system to share information based on\nthe data link between DT components.\
    \ This structure realizes data sharing between digital\nsystems and physical systems,\
    \ as well as data sharing within different DT models.\n2.4. Communication Protocols\n\
    The communication protocol realizes the information transmission between IoT\n\
    devices, and between IoT systems [49–51]. There are some representative communica-\n\
    tion protocols common across IoT systems, including Constrained Application Protocol\n\
    (CoAP) [57,58], OASIS Standard Message Passing Protocol (MQTT) [59], Modbus TCP/IP\n\
    Protocol [60–64], and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) [65]. The\
    \ sum-\nmary of communication protocols are listed in Table 1.\nCoAP [57,58] is\
    \ a specialized web communication protocol based on the User Data-\ngram Protocol\
    \ (UDP), tailored for resource-restricted devices (battery-powered IoT devices,\n\
    etc.). CoAP can be used to handle communication between IoT devices. It is designed\
    \ to be\ncompatible with the transmission of data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) and is\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n9 of 25\nmore compatible with Web-based\
    \ applications. CoAP can provide a publish and subscribe\nmechanism to simplify\
    \ the process of obtaining continuous data from the sensor.\nMQTT [59] is the\
    \ communication protocol based on Transmission Control Protocol\n(TCP). It is\
    \ a lightweight way for IoT devices to communicate with each other through\nMQTT\
    \ messages. These messages are lightweight due to their optimized headers, so\n\
    that the use of network resources can be reduced. The MQTT protocol includes MQTT\n\
    clients and MQTT brokers. The MQTT client can be IoT sensors, and the MQTT broker\
    \ can\nbe deployed in an IoT gateway, which is used to manage data communication\
    \ between\nsensors and control commands to IoT actuators. Since MQTT is based\
    \ on the TCP protocol,\nit can provide reliable data transfer. Furthermore, IoT\
    \ sensors may need to establish a\nconnection with the IoT gateway within a certain\
    \ period of time. In this case, with the\nhelp of MQTT brokers, IoT sensors can\
    \ establish a long-existing outgoing TCP protocol to\nenable transmission.\nModbus\
    \ TCP/IP [60–64] is a communication protocol used in the industrial ﬁeld to\n\
    realize the connection between industrial devices. The protocol was initially\
    \ proposed\nto provide communication between Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).\
    \ Modbus\nTCP/IP uses port 502 for data transfer. Meanwhile, the protocol contains\
    \ built-in checksum\nprotection, which can ensure the reliability of the data\
    \ transmission required in IoT systems.\nWith the aid of Modbus TCP/IP protocol,\
    \ reliable operations can be supported and applied\nto the smart grid, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and other IoT systems.\nURLLC [65] is a communication protocol that can achieve\
    \ low latency and reliability\nin the transmission process between IoT devices.\
    \ Generally speaking, URLLC is based on\nthe 5G wireless protocol, which can reduce\
    \ the delay to 0.5 ms. In order to reduce the delay,\nURLLC uses a mini-slot for\
    \ smaller time resource units, removes the scheduling mechanism\nof direct channel\
    \ access, supports asynchronous upload, and adopts dynamic scheduling\nalgorithms\
    \ such as hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In order to improve reliability,\n\
    URLLC utilizes a channel estimation mechanism, a transmission diversity mechanism,\n\
    and a bit error rate reduction mechanism. With the aid of URLLC, IoT sensors can\
    \ exchange\ninformation faster and more reliably.\n3. Integrating DT in CPS\n\
    In this section, we review some existing efforts on integrating DT in different\
    \ CPS\nsuch as the smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and\
    \ smart cities. DT\nin CPS is an evolving ﬁeld of research. There have been growing\
    \ research interests on\nintegrating DT in CPS. Figure 6 shows the number of recent\
    \ publications from 2018 to 2022\nfrom IEEE Xplore on the subject of DT and CPS\
    \ from four representative CPS (smart grid,\nsmart transportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities). The included papers are\nrelated to both DT system and CPS\
    \ system in the content or in the experiment.\nFigure 6. Number of publications\
    \ related to DT and CPS in IEEE Xplore.\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n10 of 25\n\
    3.1. Framework\nFigure 7 describes an architecture option of a DT-driven smart-world\
    \ system motivated\nby the existing efforts on DT [33]. The architecture consists\
    \ of three main components:\nthe physical subsystem, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (AI) model, and the DT model. The IoT\ngateway from each physical system collects\
    \ and aggregates the data from the physical\nsystem. With the support of communication\
    \ protocols, data can be transmitted from the\nphysical system to the AI model.\
    \ The AI model is used for data analysis and model design\nbased on the states\
    \ of physical system. Then, the AI model stores its trained model as a\nDT model\
    \ to represent the digital perspective of physical system. If the conﬁguration\
    \ of\nphysical system does not change, the DT model can guide the physical system\
    \ to react\nbased on the data collected by physical system. If the conﬁguration\
    \ of physical system\nchanges or needs to respond differently to the same situation,\
    \ the AI model can update its\nmodel according to the changes of physical system\
    \ and revise the DT model to further assist\nthe operations of physical system.\
    \ Recall that DT can assist in the control and operation of\nphysical systems\
    \ [34].\nFigure 7. DT-based CPS.\n3.2. Smart Grid\nAs a key energy infrastructure,\
    \ the smart grid leverages information communication\ntechnology (i.e., cyber\
    \ system) to provide two-way communication (of both energy and\ninformation) so\
    \ that the monitoring and control of the grid can be improved and consumers\n\
    can be engaged. The physical infrastructure of the power grid is composed of power\
    \ gener-\nation facilities, transmission facilities, and power distribution facilities.\
    \ Power generation\nfacilities are responsible for generating electricity, while\
    \ transmission facilities are used\nto deliver power to distribution facilities.\
    \ Finally, power distribution facilities provide\nelectricity to consumers.\n\
    With the integration of the cyber system, the next-generation power grid, denoted\n\
    as the smart grid, has been envisioned to provide more efﬁcient energy service\
    \ for users,\nincluding reliable and intelligent distribution management, renewable\
    \ energy integration,\nenergy storage, grid monitoring and control, and the integration\
    \ of electric vehicles into\nthe grid [5]. Generally speaking, the smart grid\
    \ is a highly distributed grid system, which\nintegrates information communication\
    \ techniques, including sensing, networking commu-\nnications, data analytics,\
    \ and machine learning [66,67]. These technologies can improve the\nreliability,\
    \ efﬁciency, and security resilience of the grid system.\nThe smart grid system\
    \ is a large-scale distributed system. To improve the monitor\nand control of\
    \ the grid, it is critical to know the states of physical objects (voltage, current,\n\
    etc.) in the system. To do so, a massive quantity of sensors can be deployed in\
    \ the grid\nto measure the state of critical objects and derive the accurate and\
    \ insightful knowledge\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n11 of 25\nof physical objects\
    \ based on measurements. In the past, both static and dynamic state\nestimation\
    \ have been applied to the monitoring and control of the grid, and bad data\n\
    detection algorithms have also been designed to deal with corrupted, invalid measurement,\n\
    and/or malicious injection data, which can be generated via measurement error,\
    \ sensor\nfailure, or even cyber threats [24,25]. Note that in addition to potential\
    \ failures in the grid,\ncyber threats can directly or indirectly affect the grid’s\
    \ operations by injecting malicious\nmeasurement data and/or manipulating the\
    \ critical control information to the actuator.\nTo handle cyber threats, it is\
    \ critical to not only monitor the state of physical objects but also\nmonitor\
    \ the state of cyber components. In this regard, the DT can be a viable approach\
    \ to\nlink the objects in the physical world to the cyber world.\nDT uses a data-driven\
    \ modeling strategy to map the physical grid to the digital grid\nso that monitoring\
    \ and management operations for the entire grid can be enabled. Based\non the\
    \ DT architecture that we have discussed, the smart grid system can be divided\
    \ into\nseveral layers: object layer, communication layer, application layer,\
    \ and end-user layer.\nIn the object layer, grid components include power generation\
    \ facilities, transmission\nfacilities, and power distribution facilities. The\
    \ communication layer is responsible for\nthe communication to connect objects,\
    \ supporting data exchange between the objects and\nthe application layer, and\
    \ the data communication within the object layer. For example,\nthe gateway of\
    \ the communication layer contains the device information of object layer.\nWhen\
    \ the application layer needs data, the gateway can retrieve the data from a speciﬁc\n\
    device as required. The application layer can also construct a digital model based\
    \ on the\ndevice distribution information from the gateway.\nThe application layer\
    \ includes a digital representation of the gateways from the phys-\nical system,\
    \ which contains device information from the object layer; it communicates\nbetween\
    \ the application layer and the object layer through the communication layer.\
    \ In the\napplication layer, the AI model is trained based on the data collected\
    \ from the object layer,\nand the trained model is stored in the data storage\
    \ for future use. If the physical state of the\nobject layer changes, the application\
    \ layer can send commands to some actuators in the ob-\nject layer to control\
    \ the grid based on the current data and the trained model. If the physical\n\
    components of the object layer change, the AI model can perform model updates\
    \ to reﬂect\nthe changes as well. The end user layer uses the information processed\
    \ by the application\nlayer to provide services for end users, including smart\
    \ grid management systems, smart\ncharging systems for autonomous vehicles, and\
    \ hybrid energy management systems.\nThere are a number of research efforts on\
    \ DT for the smart grid [38,39,68–71]. For\nexample, General Electric (GE) proposed\
    \ two models related to the use of DT in wind\nfarms [68,69]. In the object layer,\
    \ a communication network was designed to enable\nwind turbines to communicate\
    \ with each other. A wind turbine control system was also\nimplemented to control\
    \ one or more wind turbines. The middleware layer includes a cloud-\nbased infrastructure\
    \ with the support of the communication network so that the data (e.g.,\nstate\
    \ of turbines) can be collected and turbines can be remotely controlled via gateways.\
    \ It\nalso includes digital models that represent digital replicas of wind turbines.\
    \ The digital\nmodel can be updated based on the information extracted from the\
    \ object layer, and the\nwind farm can be controlled through an industrial gateway.\
    \ In addition, GE designed a\ngraphical user interface (GUI) in the application\
    \ layer to show the digital representation of\nthe wind farm and perform the control\
    \ and management operations of the wind farm.\nAhmed et al. [39] proposed a microgrid\
    \ DT model based on the IoT to mitigate cyber\nattacks. The object includes microgrid,\
    \ local controller, and area controller. Real-time\nbalancing algorithms were\
    \ implemented in each controller. If some microgrids are attacked\nand go ofﬂine,\
    \ the area controller can obtain information, and the balancing algorithm will\n\
    not transfer more power to the ofﬂine area based on the tampered data. This architecture\n\
    can also mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and false injection\
    \ attacks.\nLikewise, Nikolaos et al. [38] used DT to manage a large number of\
    \ devices in the smart\ngrid system. To be speciﬁc, they used the spike neural\
    \ network (SNN) deployed on\nthe smart meter in the grid to detect fault nodes.\
    \ A transient state estimator (TSE) was\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n12 of 25\n\
    designed to reveal the dynamic state of the smart grid. William et al. [70] leveraged\
    \ deep\nlearning algorithms to analyze data from the supervisory control and data\
    \ acquisition\nsystem (SCADA) to assist the DT in detecting physical faults in\
    \ the smart grid system.\nLikewise, Payam et al. [71] proposed a DT framework\
    \ with artiﬁcial neural networks\n(ANN) for distributed smart grids to ensure\
    \ real-time model generation, veriﬁcation,\nand identiﬁcation.\n3.3. Smart Transportation\n\
    The smart transportation system can be regarded as a CPS, which provides a va-\n\
    riety of services for the transportation domain, including trafﬁc management control.\n\
    Some applications in smart transportation systems include toll payment, vehicle\
    \ operation,\nemergency, vehicle control and safety management, and maintenance\
    \ and construction\nmanagement [6,72,73]. Since the smart transportation system\
    \ requires real-time data trans-\nmission and analysis capabilities to implement\
    \ time-sensitive services such as autonomous\nvehicles, it is difﬁcult for traditional\
    \ models to complete model training under massive\ndata within a short time. It\
    \ is additionally challenging for traditional smart transportation\nsystems to\
    \ complete the collection and aggregation of all sensor data within a short time.\n\
    In this case, the DT model can use high performance cloud/edge servers in the\
    \ digital\nsystem to conduct data aggregation and model training so that real-time\
    \ processing and\ntransmission can be achieved.\nBased on the architecture of\
    \ the DT that we have discussed, DT in the transportation\nsystem consists of\
    \ four layers. The object layer contains the components of the infrastructure\n\
    and participants (e.g., drivers), including sensors on the vehicle, trafﬁc cameras,\
    \ and other\ntrafﬁc sensors. The communication layer uses a variety of gateways\
    \ to process sensor data\nfrom the object layer, and handle data transmission\
    \ between the object and application\nlayers. The application layer maps the gateway\
    \ from the communication layer to realize\ndata transmission between the communication\
    \ layer and the application layer. Based on\nthe data and sensor information from\
    \ the gateway, the DT can use ML/DL technology\nto train the model and store it\
    \ in data storage. The end-user layer can navigate based\non the data processed\
    \ by the application layer, assist the driving of autonomous vehicles,\nand cooperate\
    \ with smart cities and smart grids to reduce transportation costs, reduce\nenergy\
    \ consumption, and make the charging process of electric vehicles more efﬁcient.\n\
    There have been some research efforts on DT-driven smart transportation. For example,\n\
    Peter et al. [74] proposed a scheme for DT-driven smart transportation that attempts\
    \ to\noptimize trafﬁc ﬂows in urban areas. The proposed smart transportation system\
    \ includes an\nAI model, a digital replica of the road network, and various trafﬁc\
    \ control and management\nservices. The system obtains data from the object layer,\
    \ including trafﬁc lights, sensors,\nand cameras. After the smart transportation\
    \ system processes the data, it will build an\napplication at the end-user layer\
    \ based on the collected data, which is called the city service\ninformation system.\
    \ Then, operators can manage the entire system at a high level based on\nthe end\
    \ user’s application. Additionally, Sagar et al. [75] proposed a DT-based adaptive\n\
    trafﬁc signal control (ATSC) to reduce the waiting time at intersections, thereby\
    \ improving\nthe driver’s driving experience. In that study, the Urban Trafﬁc\
    \ Simulation (SUMO) was\nused as the simulation platform.\nAdditionally, Wang\
    \ et al. [76] designed a DT-based veriﬁcation platform to perform\nveriﬁcation\
    \ between different metro systems. The object domain includes operation center;\n\
    trackside and train information is collected, and data is transmitted to the DT\
    \ system of the\napplication layer through various communication protocols, including\
    \ 4G, 5G, Ethernet,\nand NB-IoT. The DT platform uses ML/DL, data fusion, and\
    \ data modeling to analyze all\ndata and assist the end-user level in scheduling,\
    \ train monitoring, pedestrian monitoring,\netc. Sahal et al. [77] proposed a\
    \ DT structure combined with blockchain to enable DT-\nbased intelligent transportation\
    \ systems to achieve interoperability, identity veriﬁcation,\ndistributed ML/decision-making,\
    \ and scalability and robustness. Likewise, Guo et al. [78]\ndemonstrated a DT-based\
    \ 3D collaborative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) to visualize\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2022, 14, 64\n13 of 25\nreal-time road data and use LIDAR as road sensors. They\
    \ used the ROS bridge as a\ncommunication protocol to communicate between the\
    \ physical and virtual worlds.\n3.4. Smart Manufacturing\nThe smart manufacturing\
    \ system, as a general concept, is the integration of traditional\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems and processes with information communication technologies to\nenable\
    \ advanced intelligence and process optimization and automation. The demands\n\
    of current manufacturing systems can be complex in nature, due to the challenges\
    \ of\nscalability, efﬁciency, delivery, or design requirements [79]. The smart\
    \ manufacturing\nsystem is the utilization of emerging technologies to massively\
    \ optimize production in\nterms of throughput, efﬁciency, precision, loss, resource\
    \ consumption, scale, and value [7].\nTraditional manufacturing systems are comprised\
    \ of shop ﬂoor hardware that works\nas a unit to streamline the production of\
    \ a deliverable product. In contrast, the smart\nmanufacturing system integrates\
    \ communication and computing technologies to utilize\ninformation generated from\
    \ traditional manufacturing systems to make a more complete\nrepresentation of\
    \ a product life cycle. The application of IoT to industrial systems, or Indus-\n\
    try 4.0, relies on technologies such as sensing, control, communication, computing,\
    \ and data\nscience to support information ﬂows between different components of\
    \ the manufacturing\nsystem, allowing for better system interoperability and use.\n\
    One major limitation in manufacturing systems is the ability to automate and mass\n\
    produce in a manner that is efﬁcient and cost-effective. With the shifting paradigm\
    \ in\nmanufacturing of custom user deliverables, there is an increased challenge\
    \ to provide\ncustom solutions in a method that can be massively produced by manufacturing\
    \ systems.\nA common issue in manufacturing is the ability to generate a deliverable\
    \ that is ﬂexible to\nthe user’s needs while still maintaining automated systems\
    \ that can quickly and efﬁciently\ncreate products. At scale, it is often difﬁcult\
    \ to analyze how changing requirements in\nthe product design or supply chain\
    \ will impact variables such as cost and production\ntimelines while retaining\
    \ quality and efﬁciency. Additionally, adoption rates are going\nto be a challenge\
    \ for manufacturing environments that are looking to incorporate smart\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems in their product life-cycle. A core technology for enabling smart\n\
    manufacturing is the availability of information from the physical objects (i.e.,\
    \ shop ﬂoor\nequipment) through IoT sensors connected to IoT networking infrastructure.\n\
    Implementation of DT in the smart manufacturing system can help evaluate the\n\
    effectiveness of large-scale production environments by utilizing models for analyzing\n\
    production efﬁciency and design factors. The link between the virtual and physical\
    \ rep-\nresentation of a manufacturing system (i.e., in the way of DT) can determine\
    \ whether a\ndesign is going to be cost-effective by integrating with decision\
    \ support systems such as\nsupply chain management and timeline forecasts. The\
    \ integration of smart supply chain\ntechnologies involves a real-time link between\
    \ the production environment and the sup-\npliers and distribution centers to\
    \ determine the deliverable dates [80]. Determining the\navailability of materials\
    \ required for manufacturing production will allow the system to\ngenerate a cost\
    \ model and timeline for delivering a ﬁnal product.\nMonitoring the physical production\
    \ environment with DT systems can allow for the\nreal-time analysis of system\
    \ health on physical things (i.e., equipment, tools, and hardware)\nand prevent\
    \ delays based on environmental factors. In the event of an anomaly detection\n\
    on a manufacturing system, the DT model can determine whether the work load should\
    \ be\nrerouted to another system in the manufacturing line to avoid delays in\
    \ production [81].\nIoT sensors in manufacturing equipment allow for real-time\
    \ monitoring, enabling the de-\ntection of events that could cause breakdowns\
    \ in the manufacturing system and providing\nalternative scenarios for maintaining\
    \ system efﬁciency to prevent delays in production\ntimelines [82].\nSince smart\
    \ manufacturing can apply to many different levels of technologies in\nmanufacturing\
    \ systems, it is important to consider the level of adoption for technologies\
    \ in\nIndustry 4.0 scenarios. For example, Frank et al. [80] analyzed different\
    \ levels of adoption\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n14 of 25\nin several different\
    \ manufacturing domains and concluded that the implementation of\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ technologies is interrelated and provides potential beneﬁts when more systems\n\
    are integrated with smart manufacturing processes. Additionally, the utilization\
    \ of both\nfront-end technologies and base technologies could provide more complete\
    \ integration\nbetween physical systems and virtual representations that can better\
    \ handle the challenges\nof requirement complexity and decision support systems.\n\
    With the support from the communication layer and techniques to enable data aggre-\n\
    gation, DT implementation can help with the following scenarios in a smart manufacturing\n\
    system. The ﬁrst scenario is the detection of fault tolerance and device health,\
    \ which can\nhelp smart manufacturing systems to avoid outages by predicting device\
    \ failures and\nrerouting workﬂows in the production process. In particular, cloud-based\
    \ frameworks\nthat are designed to handle large amounts of data utilize embedded\
    \ sensor systems in\nmanufacturing devices in order to monitor system health,\
    \ leading to the creation of pre-\ndictive models for avoidance procedures [83].\
    \ In the example of a robotic gripper in a\nmanufacturing production line, Redelinghuys\
    \ et al. [82] investigated anomaly detection in\nthe gripper closing speed for\
    \ detecting via pressure sensor to detect faults and degradation\nthat could lead\
    \ to failure and considered utilizing the result to reroute production trafﬁc\
    \ to\nanother assembly line. This type of fault detection compares recent samples\
    \ to historical\ndata and builds a model that determines when a device is likely\
    \ to fail in a production\nenvironment, enabling the automated scheduling of preventative\
    \ maintenance.\nThe second scenario is supporting supply chain management, which\
    \ involves the\nintegration of DT systems and the communication of real-time data\
    \ between suppliers and\ndistribution centers. The tracking of products can be\
    \ integrated into the supplier systems to\ninform the manufacturer system and\
    \ can be integrated with the customer-facing deliverable\nto accurately determine\
    \ product delivery timelines and end-to-end supply chain logistics.\nThe tracking\
    \ of goods required for a customer deliverable can be remotely monitored and\n\
    integrated between supplier and manufacturer systems to determine the availability\
    \ of\ngoods required to produce a product [84]. In the event that a good required\
    \ for a custom\ndeliverable is not available, the decision support system can\
    \ determine whether there is a\nmore suitable supplier for the product and whether\
    \ it would be cost-efﬁcient to utilize a\ndifferent supplier. By generating a\
    \ pricing and timeline model for the availability of goods,\nthe manufacturer\
    \ can determine whether the product is worth producing and provide an\naccurate\
    \ cost analysis to the customer.\nNote that one of the emerging challenges of\
    \ manufacturing systems is the ability to\ncreate highly customized products in\
    \ a manner that is efﬁcient. Manufacturing in general is\noften focused on the\
    \ mass production of a good or product in order to decrease the cost and\neffort\
    \ required per unit. This type of mass production is often associated with processes\n\
    that are easily automated to speed up the production time. With the shifting paradigm\n\
    of manufacturing trending towards more customized deliverables [85], product variety\n\
    becomes a factor when designing production systems that will maintain efﬁciency\
    \ while\nstill meeting diverse customer requirements. Integration with DT systems\
    \ can allow for\nthe application of ML/DL algorithms and modeling technologies\
    \ to determine whether a\ncustom deliverable requirement is feasible in a given\
    \ manufacturing system. Manufacturing\nsystems need to be both ﬂexible and efﬁcient\
    \ in order to be useful for custom deliverable\nobjectives [86].\nThere are some\
    \ existing research efforts on the evolution of smart manufacturing\nconcepts\
    \ and the best way to apply DT technologies for more robust manufacturing sys-\n\
    tems [30,86–88]. For example, Lu et al. [86] reviewed the standards utilized in\
    \ smart\nmanufacturing systems, applied their research toward the production of\
    \ new standards,\nand further envisioned scenarios for smart manufacturing systems,\
    \ some of which can\nbeneﬁt from the application of DT systems. Kritzinger et\
    \ al. [30] took the application of\nsmart manufacturing one step further by studying\
    \ the application of DT as an enabling\ntechnology for Industry 4.0. Likewise,\
    \ Brennet et al. [87] discussed the convergence of digi-\nFuture Internet 2022,\
    \ 14, 64\n15 of 25\ntal and physical systems for Industry 4.0 through the application\
    \ of Personalized Product\nEmergence Processes (PPEP) and additive manufacturing\
    \ technologies.\nFurthermore, the implementation of DT in smart manufacturing\
    \ systems was inves-\ntigated [81,89,90]. For example, Tao et al. [89] summarized\
    \ the deployment structure of\nDT for smart manufacturing based on the concept\
    \ of DT Workshop, which enables digital\nsystems and physical systems to synchronize\
    \ with one another. In this case, the digital\nsystem can be virtualized based\
    \ on data from the physical system, and the physical system\ncan be optimized\
    \ based on the instructions from the digital system. In order to better\nexplain\
    \ how to deploy Digital Twin Shop-Floor (DTS), DTS was divided into four parts:\n\
    physical shop-ﬂoor, virtual shop-ﬂoor, shop-ﬂoor service system, and shop-ﬂoor\
    \ DT. Like-\nwise, Kamil et al. [90] implemented a DT in an experimental assembly\
    \ quality production\ninspection system. In particular, they used radio-frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation (RFID) and cam-\neras in the physical system and used a programmable\
    \ logic controller (PLC) system to\ncollect data. The OPC UA framework was considered\
    \ to transfer data between the physical\nsystem and the digital system. The digital\
    \ model consists of a 3D model created in CAD\ndesign software and is simulated\
    \ and virtualized using the Tecnomatix platform. The cloud\nplatform was integrated\
    \ into the digital system for data analysis so that the assembly\nquality inspection\
    \ could be realized without stopping the manufacturing process. Open-\nsource\
    \ technology can also beneﬁt the development of applying DT in smart manufacturing\n\
    scenarios. For example, Aghenta et al. [91] proposed a low-cost IoT-based SCADA\
    \ system\nsolution. In addition to providing the basic functions of a traditional\
    \ SCADA system, this\nparticular system can not only support data acquisition,\
    \ transmission, and presentation\nbut also the monitoring and control of physical\
    \ objects.\n3.5. Smart Cities\nThe objective of the smart city is to leverage\
    \ information communication and data-\nrelated technologies so that resources\
    \ can be efﬁciently used, leading to better quality of\nlife, reduction of resource\
    \ input, etc. So far, the majority of focus has been on government\nand energy\
    \ initiatives, followed by transportation, building, and water, among other goals.\n\
    A number of research and development efforts on smart cities and DT applications\
    \ have\nbeen generated [92–96]. Similar to smart manufacturing, smart cities are\
    \ the combination\nof a wide range of IoT domains to address the complex challenges\
    \ in cities and must\nincorporate cloud/edge computing with big data collection\
    \ and analysis as essential\ntechniques to drive the realization of efﬁciency\
    \ and optimization [11,97].\nIt should be noted that the development of the smart\
    \ city has involved several op-\nportunities and challenges: (i) people’s expectations\
    \ are constantly changing. How can\npeople’s expectations be accounted for when\
    \ they are frequently and forever changing,\neven when real-time communication\
    \ is a reality? How can the change in expectation be\nevaluated? (ii) How can\
    \ the latest technologies be utilized to improve the efﬁciency of\nour government?\
    \ How can we forecast outcomes and avoid potential losses or mistakes?\nHow can\
    \ we mitigate the risks? These questions have become the urgent issues that a\n\
    government must consider with respect to smart cities. Similar to numerous practices\n\
    in smart manufacturing, in smart cities, we could leverage DT to detect and address\
    \ a\nproblem before it arises, reducing cost, rather than attempting to solve\
    \ a problem after it\nhas occurred. If the results from the DT match the expectation,\
    \ data can be transferred to\nreal physical objects to implement the changes in\
    \ a fast and seamless way.\nSome efforts toward integrating DT with smart cities\
    \ have already been made [98–103].\nFor example, Deng et al. [98] reviewed some\
    \ key technologies in Digital Twin City (DTCs),\nsuch as surveying and mapping,\
    \ building information model, IoT, next-generation wireless\nnetworking, and blockchain.\
    \ Shahat et al. [99] reviewed some challenges of DT cities and\ndiscussed some\
    \ research that leveraged DT into smart cities. Note that while the city DT\n\
    cannot provide solutions for addressing problems in cities, DT can provide beneﬁts\
    \ in\nseveral areas. In order to demonstrate the performance of DT, it is necessary\
    \ to conduct\nresearch on data collection, data management, the utilization of\
    \ big data, virtual reality\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n16 of 25\n(VR), IoT,\
    \ and 3D Modeling. Likewise, Shirowzhan et al. [100] discussed technologies\n\
    that can be useful for enabling smarter cities. They identiﬁed trends in geospatial\
    \ science,\nparticularly in the application of geographic information system (GIS),\
    \ and observed the\nimpacts of newly developed online applications such as ArcGIS\
    \ Urban.\nMore and more smart cities around the world are embracing DT to replicate\
    \ its\nperformance and response to changes. By the year 2020, 118 cities were\
    \ using DT in Smart\nCity projects and systems. Cities are also using DT to reduce\
    \ carbon dioxide emissions and\nmanage trafﬁc efﬁciently. According to ABI Research,\
    \ DT could assist cities in carrying out\ncost-effective urban resource planning\
    \ [104]. We believe that DT has the potential to further\nimprove upon the already\
    \ signiﬁcant gains that it has achieved.\n4. Challenges\nIntegrating DT into CPS\
    \ can not only improve the efﬁcient operation of CPS through\nincreased intelligence,\
    \ it can also assist CPS in providing more valuable service to end-\nusers. Recall\
    \ that as DT is a digital replicate of physical things, it is critical to make\
    \ DT\ncapable of representing a variety of things in a timely, accurate, and efﬁcient\
    \ manner.\nThe realization of such a DT raises numerous challenges to the networking,\
    \ computing,\ncontrol, and data analysis of IoT. Furthermore, the design of DT\
    \ shall consider the numerous\nexceptional requirements of CPS (e.g., latency,\
    \ reliability, safety, scalability, security, and\nprivacy). To address such challenges,\
    \ designing DT offers opportunities for novel and\ninterdisciplinary research\
    \ efforts.\n4.1. CPS Challenges\nAs a complex system that requires the coordination\
    \ of network, computing, and con-\ntrol, CPS has strict performance requirements\
    \ in different application scenarios. Generally\nspeaking, CPS applications require\
    \ very low latency, high reliability, and large scalability.\nTaking the smart\
    \ transportation system as an example, suppose we are designing applica-\ntions\
    \ related to autonomous driving. Vehicles need to be able to quickly collect pertinent\n\
    information. This information includes data collected by sensors, transmitted\
    \ through the\nInternet of Vehicles, and so on. Then, the vehicle needs to process\
    \ this data quickly, extract\nusable information, and control the vehicle according\
    \ to the determined situation at the\ntime. Since vehicle driving is closely related\
    \ to personal safety, there is no doubt that the\nreliability of autonomous driving\
    \ is our primary consideration. The issues that we need to\nconsider include network\
    \ failures, computing hardware failures, and many more.\nMoreover, because the\
    \ number of vehicles in each scenario will be different, we need\nto ensure the\
    \ scalability of the autonomous driving application that we design to handle\n\
    the problems caused by the large number of vehicles, such as network congestion\
    \ and high\ncontrol algorithm complexity. From this example, we can conclude that\
    \ the performance\nrequirements of CPS are very strict. The overall performance\
    \ of CPS is the result of multiple\nsubsystem (network, computing, and control)\
    \ interactions and is synthesized within the\nCPS. This interaction means that\
    \ any slight change in the performance of any one subsystem\ncan have a compounding\
    \ effect on the performance of other subsystems, thereby causing a\ncomplex impact\
    \ on the performance of the entire CPS system. Thus, when building a DT\nfor CPS,\
    \ it is challenging to not only meet all these strict performance requirements\
    \ but also\nto reﬂect the interactions between the various subsystems in a timely\
    \ manner.\n4.2. Data Science Challenges\nBuilding the DT of a complex system itself\
    \ is very challenging, involving mathematical\nmodeling and data analysis. There\
    \ are two major approaches to building an accurate DT:\nmodel-driven and data-driven.\
    \ When we adopt the model-driven approach, we use\nmathematical models to represent\
    \ physical systems. Therefore, knowing how to build\na mathematical model that\
    \ accurately represents a complex physical system in CPS is a\nchallenging problem.\
    \ Since there are many variables involved in the physical system of\nCPS, the\
    \ mathematical model will be signiﬁcantly complicated, typically with properties\n\
    Future Internet 2022, 14, 64\n17 of 25\nsuch as non-linearity, highly-coupled,\
    \ and time-variance. When we adopt a data-driven\napproach, we collect massive\
    \ amounts of data from the physical system that reﬂects its\nstatus over time.\
    \ The process of collecting and selecting these data poses some challenges.\n\
    First of all, in CPS, one type of data may be collected from multiple sources,\
    \ and the\nhardware conditions of these sources will be different, such that it\
    \ is difﬁcult to ensure that\nthe quality of all data is the same. Second, the\
    \ storage and transmission of this massive\namount of data creates signiﬁcant\
    \ overhead to the system. In order to truly reﬂect the\ntimely updates of the\
    \ physical system, we often sample the state of the physical system\nat a very\
    \ high frequency, and these data require considerable storage space and pose\n\
    signiﬁcant overhead for networking and computing infrastructures with strict performance\n\
    requirements. Therefore, one fundamental data science problem is how to collect\
    \ the\nleast amount of data without signiﬁcantly and negatively impacting the\
    \ efﬁcacy of DT.\nIn conclusion, how to effectively construct a DT for the complex\
    \ system with the least\namount of data is a challenging problem that needs to\
    \ consider both mathematical modeling\nand data science aspects.\n4.3. Optimization\
    \ Challenges\nRealizing a DT in CPS that accounts for the interactions of computing,\
    \ control, commu-\nnication, and data analysis modules in an end-to-end chain\
    \ is challenging. The communica-\ntion resource allocation algorithms, such as\
    \ time and frequency resource scheduling, are\nvery complex, especially when combined\
    \ with massively distributed networking devices\nand low latency requirements.\
    \ In addition, the computing resource allocation, such as\ntask-ofﬂoading in an\
    \ edge/cloud computing architecture, is another optimization problem\nwith stringent\
    \ performance constraints. Furthermore, the control mechanism, possibly\nevent-triggered\
    \ or time-triggered control, or both, yields still another optimization prob-\n\
    lem. In addition, analysis of the collected data is highly complex, requiring\
    \ prodigious\nfeature extraction, and training (or at least validation), coupled\
    \ with potentially continual\nprediction or classiﬁcation to satisfy real-time\
    \ requirements.\nThe DT is a combination of the real-time computing, real-time\
    \ control, and real-time\ncommunication, which generates the joint/integrated\
    \ optimization problem of computing,\ncontrol, and communication. Consider VR-supported\
    \ smart manufacturing as an example.\nFirst, we need to deliver massive amounts\
    \ of sensing data with required latency. Then,\nwe need to use the graphics engine\
    \ to generate the digital model in real time. Finally, we\nneed to execute the\
    \ control command within the latency constraint. Since any problem in\nthis chain\
    \ will directly affect the performance of the other, even in a centralized system\n\
    with superior hardware conditions, it is very challenging to perform joint optimization\n\
    on this VR system. Further, the distributed system of CPS only makes the problem\
    \ of\njoint optimization much harder. For example, in our previous work [105],\
    \ we adopted\ndeep reinforcement learning to help conﬁgure the network and dynamically\
    \ change the\nsensor sampling rate at the same time to improve the control performance\
    \ of a distributed\nsmart manufacturing system. However, by introducing DT to\
    \ the CPS, there are more\nprocesses that need to be considered. For example,\
    \ in the control process, there are two\nprocesses, such as the domain expert\
    \ controlling DT and DT controlling the physical objects.\nThe computing of DT\
    \ in CPS needs to consider three computing processes, such as the\ncomputing process\
    \ of generating a digital copy of a physical object, the computing process\nof\
    \ the interaction between DTs in a simulated scenario, and the computing process\
    \ of actual\nCPS tasks. The communication of DT in CPS needs to consider the communication\
    \ between\nthe physical object and the virtual clone, the communication between\
    \ the DT and other\nDTs, and the communication between the DT and the human control\
    \ interface. These extra\nprocesses make the optimization problem more difﬁcult\
    \ to solve.\nTaking into account the limited resources of the CPS system, we also\
    \ need to optimize\nthe large amount of data generated in these processes from\
    \ the perspective of data gen-\neration, data storage, and data transmission.\
    \ From a data generation perspective, when\nwe generate the data needed to build\
    \ a DT in CPS, the quality of the data is a major issue.\nFuture Internet 2022,\
    \ 14, 64\n18 of 25\nBecause we need to deploy a massive number of CPS devices,\
    \ the hardware conditions of a\nsingle CPS device are often very limited. In addition,\
    \ in the CPS environment, one type\nof data may be collected by multiple sources.\
    \ Thus, how to effectively select data sources\nfor different CPS applications\
    \ is a challenging problem. From a data storage perspective,\nwhen we are building\
    \ the DT, in order to truly reﬂect the timely update of physical objects,\nwe\
    \ often sample the state of physical objects at a relatively high frequency. Inevitably,\n\
    an incredible volume of data will be collected on the DT server side. On one hand,\
    \ these\ndata can be used to assist in the development of other DT systems; on\
    \ the other hand, these\ndata take up signiﬁcant storage space. Because there\
    \ is not a simple linear relationship\nbetween the amount of stored data and the\
    \ performance of the DT system, the question of\nhow to accurately select useful\
    \ data for storage has always been difﬁcult to answer. From a\ndata transmission\
    \ perspective, due to the heterogeneity of CPS systems, IoT/CPS devices\nuse different\
    \ communication technologies. When we need to transmit data between these\ndevices,\
    \ we usually deploy a gateway with various radio interfaces for data exchange.\
    \ This\nsolution will bring additional hardware costs and potential network bottlenecks.\
    \ Con-\nsidering that the DT system has very strict requirements on timing and\
    \ latency, it is very\nchallenging to design networking infrastructure to support\
    \ real-time communications so\nthat the information between different components\
    \ can be delivered quickly and efﬁciently.\n4.4. Security and Privacy Challenges\n\
    We now discuss the security and privacy challenges. Since DT needs to update the\n\
    state of physical objects in real time through network communications, DT will\
    \ be subject\nto cyber attacks, such as integrity attacks on physical hardware\
    \ and sensors, transmission,\nand digital systems. Taking the data integrity attack\
    \ as an example, the adversary can\ndirectly attack IoT devices as data collectors,\
    \ causing them to upload invalid/misleading\ndata. Alternatively, an adversary\
    \ can attack the gateway, to which the IoT device uploads\ndata, mixing the invalid/misleading\
    \ data with the correct data collected by IoT devices.\nFinally, the adversary\
    \ could directly inject false data into the DT. Because the DT and\nphysical objects\
    \ are closely connected, any one of these attacks will yield a signiﬁcant\nimpact\
    \ on the integrity of the entire system.\nAdditionally, from the perspective of\
    \ conﬁdentiality, the DT applications contain\na large amount of privacy-sensitive\
    \ information, such as medical records, autonomous\nvehicle sensing information,\
    \ and real-time smart grid operation information. Therefore,\nit is not only necessary\
    \ to implement an authentication mechanism for physical objects\nbut also an authentication\
    \ mechanism for digital communication and machine-to-machine\ntransmission. Nonetheless,\
    \ it can be costly to implement authentication mechanisms on\nlow-energy IoT devices.\
    \ In this case, knowing how to handle the authentication process\non devices with\
    \ limited power has become a challenge. From a usability point of view,\nDT applications\
    \ rely on sensor information from the object layer to help the DT build\nthe digital\
    \ clone of the physical system. In this case, adversaries can launch attacks on\n\
    sensor or gateway, such as a denial of service (DoS) attack or malware propagation.\
    \ Once\nthe gateway or sensor is compromised, it is difﬁcult for DT to obtain\
    \ the overall states of\nthe physical system. For this reason, it is important\
    \ to propose and validate mitigation\nmechanisms to reduce the impact of such\
    \ attacks.\n5. Research Directions\nIn extending the DT to IoT scenarios, promising\
    \ new ﬁelds arise that are worthy of\nfurther investigation. We will discuss the\
    \ future research directions from the following as-\npects: performance, new DT-driven\
    \ services, modeling and machine learning, and security\nand privacy.\n5.1. Performance\n\
    As we discussed in Section 4, the DT in CPS has very strict performance requirements\n\
    to achieve real-time computing, real-time control, and real-time communication.\
    \ We believe\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n19 of 25\nthat the joint optimization\
    \ of sensing, control, networking, computing, and data analysis is\ncritically\
    \ important for DT to meet these performance requirements. There have been some\n\
    works focused on one of these optimization targets (sensing, control, networking,\
    \ or data\nanalysis), and some results have been achieved. However, if we need\
    \ to maximize the\noverall performance of the system, we must study the interaction\
    \ between all components\nand design a joint optimization strategy. Taking the\
    \ intelligent transportation system as\nan example, suppose we are generating\
    \ DT for moving vehicles in a certain area to better\nmanage trafﬁc. We use sensor\
    \ data from both vehicles and cities to build DT. When we\nselect data, simply\
    \ having more data is not optimal. Instead, the pre-processing of the data\nshould\
    \ account for the quality of the data, the bandwidth of the network, the computing\n\
    power of the infrastructure, and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of\
    \ the speciﬁc\napplication. Similarly, when we are transmitting the data, we need\
    \ to consider not only\nthe current communication environment but also the mobility\
    \ of the vehicle, and the data\nstorage space of the vehicle, among others.\n\
    5.2. New DT-Driven Services\nBy combining DT and IoT search services, we can interconnect\
    \ different CPS systems\nand provide more services. Speciﬁcally, the DT bridges\
    \ CPS in disparate domains, such\nas transportation, energy, and manufacturing,\
    \ to obtain a ubiquitous connection. The DT\nenables more data sharing to create\
    \ abundant content that improves the IoT search results.\nFor example, the DT\
    \ bridges electric cars that primarily consume energy with the smart grid\nthat\
    \ primarily generates and stores electricity. With DT, electric cars can obtain\
    \ seamless\nand efﬁcient energy supply via the information from digitized charging\
    \ piles, solar planes,\nand so on. IoT search services such as location-based\
    \ search and content-based search can\nalso help us ﬁnd IoT devices and data to\
    \ build DTs [48,106]. This is particularly important\nin the rapidly changing\
    \ CPS environment.\nFor example, in the smart transportation system, suppose we\
    \ are using smart cameras\nto build digital clones of vehicles. After a few seconds,\
    \ the vehicle drives out of the range\nof the smart camera. We can use the location-based\
    \ IoT search service to ﬁnd other cameras\naround the vehicle to ensure that DT\
    \ can continue to work. As another example, if we want\nto know the moving trajectory\
    \ of vehicle, we can use a content-based IoT search service to\nﬁnd all the information\
    \ that contains the vehicle license plate. Finally, some new services\ncan be\
    \ provided by DT on different CPS. For example, in the smart manufacturing system,\n\
    operators can check DT through algorithms to quickly perform quality inspections\
    \ on a\nlarge number of products. In the smart home, users can integrate smart\
    \ cameras and VR\ndevices to provide holographic remote social interaction. In\
    \ the smart grid, DT can be used\nto monitor the status of infrastructures in\
    \ real time. In smart health care, DT can be used to\nmonitor and record the vital\
    \ signs of patients so that doctors can make better treatment\nplans. Likewise,\
    \ in the smart transportation system, DT can be used to dynamically plan\nroutes\
    \ and provide additional driving assistance functions such as blind spot monitoring,\n\
    brake warning, etc.\n5.3. Modeling and Machine Learning\nConsidering the challenges\
    \ of modeling a complex system in Section 4.2, a modeling\nmethodology that can\
    \ be adapted to different CPS systems is worth studying. There are\ntwo major\
    \ directions that should be investigated: model-based DT and model-free DT.\n\
    For model-based DT, the main problem is that the CPS system is difﬁcult to mathe-\n\
    matically model, and there are signiﬁcant differences between different CPS. Therefore,\n\
    any model that works and is complete for one CPS will need to be re-modeled every\
    \ time\nthe CPS changes. To address this problem, one solution is modular DT.\
    \ This focuses on\nbuilding the DT of the small objects of the system and combining\
    \ them to form the DT of\nthe entire system, instead of building the entire system\
    \ from the beginning. This not only\nreduces the complexity of building a DT model\
    \ but also uses the constructed DT models to\ncreate a different combination DT\
    \ systems.\nFuture Internet 2022, 14, 64\n20 of 25\nIn model-free DT, we establish\
    \ DT by frequently collecting information on physical\nobjects. Because this kind\
    \ of DT completely relies on observations and disregards mathe-\nmatical model\
    \ support, it is difﬁcult for us to predict the state of the system, which greatly\n\
    affects the control and optimization of the DT system. Therefore, we consider\
    \ using DL to\ngenerate a neural network-based model by learning data collected\
    \ from the CPS devices.\nIn this case, even for very complex systems that are\
    \ difﬁcult to model, we can still use DL\nmodels to build DT. Nonetheless, one\
    \ problem is that ML/DL algorithms usually require a\nlarge amount of data, which\
    \ is sometimes difﬁcult to provide for CPS devices with limited\nresources. Therefore,\
    \ it is worth investigating the best way to design DL models that\nwork for small\
    \ amounts of data. Moreover, training a DL model requires considerable\ncomputing\
    \ power, and trained models need to be retrained once the environment changes,\n\
    both of which are obviously too demanding for CPS devices. To solve these problems,\
    \ we\nbelieve that using transfer learning is a promising solution [107]. Transfer\
    \ learning is an ML\ntechnology that can transfer the learned knowledge from one\
    \ a well-trained model to a new\nlearning model. Speciﬁcally, with transfer learning,\
    \ we can use a generic DL model trained\nwith large amount of the data as the\
    \ source model and replace several of the last (terminal)\nlayers in the network\
    \ to construct a new model. During the training phase, we only update\nthe replaced\
    \ layers. By using this transfer learning technique, we can use less training\
    \ data\nto obtain better performance than training from scratch. Because there\
    \ are fewer network\nparameters that need to be trained, this method also reduces\
    \ the requirements for device\ncomputing power and storage space. Therefore, it\
    \ is suitable for real-time computing,\nreal-time control, and real-time communication\
    \ in a large-scale distributed CPS system.\nFinally, we should consider the integration\
    \ of model-based DT and model-free DT\ninto a hybrid-model DT. Even in the most\
    \ complex cps system, there will be components\nthat can be easily mathematically\
    \ modeled. Therefore, we can mathematically model those\ncomponents of the system\
    \ that are easily modeled and use a model-free approach such as\nDL to model the\
    \ remaining components. Once a DL-based model is trained, it can be treated\n\
    as a modular model and directly integrated with other model-based DTs in a modular\n\
    DT system. For example, in the smart transportation system, we can mathematically\n\
    model the mobility of vehicles and use DL to model the Internet of Vehicle communication.\n\
    By combining these two components together, we can obtain a complete DT of moving\n\
    vehicles in CPS.\n5.4. Security and Privacy\nDT applications rely on data provided\
    \ by IoT sensors and gateways. In this case, data\nand communication security\
    \ and privacy are an important research direction. In consider-\ning security,\
    \ we discuss the research from several perspectives: conﬁdentiality, integrity,\n\
    and availability.\nIn terms of conﬁdentiality, we now take the smart transportation\
    \ system as an example.\nDT obtains data from IoT sensors installed near roads,\
    \ vehicles, etc. At the same time, IoT\nsensors may belong to different organizations/operators.\
    \ In this case, different organiza-\ntions/operators need to ensure the conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data through some authentication\nand secured communication protocols. In\
    \ addition, some data stored in the application\nlayer, such as vehicle location\
    \ and trafﬁc camera data, are sensitive. Thus, access control\nneeds to be in\
    \ place to protect user privacy. At the same time, some information security\n\
    regulations can protect user privacy and achieve data conﬁdentiality by restricting\
    \ data\nsharing, especially on the end-user layer. For example, in the ﬁeld of\
    \ healthcare, Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) will\
    \ be used to regulate the sharing\nand conﬁdentiality of user medical data.\n\
    For the sake of integrity, some DT applications, including smart grid, smart transporta-\n\
    tion, smart manufacturing, and smart cities, require real-time data to build a\
    \ digital model\nof the DT system. In this case, data integrity is essential for\
    \ the DT system to correctly\nmodel and guide the physical system in response\
    \ to changes in the environment. Based\non the DT architecture, we discuss the\
    \ integrity of the four layers. For the object layer,\nFuture Internet 2022, 14,\
    \ 64\n21 of 25\nthe sensors need to communicate with the gateways. In this case,\
    \ the communication\nfrom sensor to gateway and gateway to sensor at the application\
    \ layer needs to be secured\nto prevent an adversary from hijacking the communication\
    \ using a man-in-the-middle\n(MITM) attack or others. In addition, authentication\
    \ and other security mechanisms must\nbe in place to restrict unauthorized users\
    \ from modifying data. At the same time, at the\napplication layer, anomaly detection\
    \ can be used to detect manipulated data to ensure data\nintegrity. Finally, an\
    \ authentication system can be implemented at the end user level to\nprevent unauthorized\
    \ users from accessing DT.\nFinally, availability is key to real-time DT. Certain\
    \ types of cyber attacks, including\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) and\
    \ malware propagation, can target sensors and\ngateways. In this case, mitigation\
    \ schemes need to be implemented on the gateways to\nﬁlter malicious trafﬁc and\
    \ reduce the impact of attacks. At the same time, an adversary can\nsend time-consuming\
    \ queries or massive queries through the end user layer to overload the\nDT. To\
    \ deal with such threats, mitigation schemes can be deployed at the application\
    \ layer\nto avert the affects. Moreover, in a certain period of time, there may\
    \ be multiple normal\nusers accessing the same service at the same time. In this\
    \ case, load balancing algorithms\ncan be deployed on the gateway. If a gateway\
    \ is overloaded, the algorithm can use nearby\nlow-load gateways to process the\
    \ request, leading to a highly resilient system.\n6. Final Remarks\nWith the rapid\
    \ advance of big data and ML/DL techniques, the cyber replica of a real\nphysical\
    \ system has been considered as a viable digital platform to emulate lifecycle\
    \ use\ncases for CPS. DT is the cyber replica of the real physical system, which\
    \ consists of real-time\ncomputing, real-time control, and real-time communication.\
    \ By leveraging the DT with\na physical system, we can imitate real-world cases\
    \ in physical systems, without directly\noperating the real-world system, to optimize\
    \ system performance. DT can also simulate\nemergency situations of the system,\
    \ allowing system operators to practice emergency plans.\nFurthermore, DT could\
    \ enable data sharing to support more data-oriented services on\nCPS. DT needs\
    \ to represent things in a timely, accurate, and efﬁcient manner, which poses\n\
    numerous challenges to the networking, control, computing, and data analysis of\
    \ CPS.\nFurthermore, the design of DT shall consider numerous exceptional requirements\
    \ of CPS\n(e.g., latency, reliability, safety, scalability, security, and privacy).\
    \ In this paper, we have\nﬁrst reviewed the principles of DT (architecture, data\
    \ presentation, and protocols). We\nhave then presented how to integrate DT in\
    \ different CPS, including smart grid, smart\ntransportation, smart manufacturing,\
    \ and smart cities. We have further discussed some\nchallenges from CPS, data\
    \ science, optimization, and security perspectives. Finally, we have\noutlined\
    \ future research directions from the perspectives of performance, new DT-driven\n\
    services, modeling and machine learning, and security and privacy.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ Nowadays, due to modernization or advance-\nment in the Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ especially in the\nHealthcare area, we want to take care of our elders with\n\
    some monitoring equipment, and the Internet of Things can\nplay a signiﬁcant role\
    \ in it. The motivation of writing this\npaper is to collect the information of\
    \ various existing\nInternet\nof\nThings\nArchitecture\nand\nCommunication\nTechniques\
    \ used in Healthcare Monitoring System to\nobserve that how efﬁciently, different\
    \ researchers have\nused it. So we have studied different real-time health\nmonitoring\
    \ system based on diseases which are common in\nelderly people like diabetes,\
    \ blood pressure, heart disease,\nsleep apnea, and cancer, etc. In this real-time\
    \ health\nmonitoring system, researchers introduced many new\nmeasures, communication\
    \ techniques like ZigBee, Long-\nRange Wide Area Network (LoRawan), Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID). Apart from this, it was also observed\nthat remote monitoring\
    \ system in Healthcare is incomplete\nwithout data processing and early prediction\
    \ in such dis-\neases. Though, Machine learning provides efﬁcient tech-\nniques\
    \ to extract knowledge from diagnostic medical\ndatasets collected from the patients.\
    \ That is why we\nhighlighted the current role of various Machine Learning\nalgorithms\n\
    like\nSupport\nVector\nMachine,\nK-Nearest\nNeighbor,\nRandom\nForest,\netc.,\n\
    for\nprocessing\nof\nHealthcare data and also helpful to predict the output more\n\

    \ Machine learning\nIntroduction\nInternet of Things (IoT) is regarding the development\
    \ of\nthe internet ahead of computers and smartphones to an\nentire series of\
    \ environments, procedures, and other things.\nIt has been many years since IoT\
    \ came into existence, but\nstill, we have not entirely understood it, and this\
    \ is the\nreason why we have not been able to use it efﬁciently in the\nhealthcare\
    \ area. It means to say that it is yet to be known\nwell so that we can use it\
    \ properly in our daily life. As IoT\nis entering into healthcare, the expectation\
    \ of getting new\nfacilities is also increasing especially for the elderly. In\n\
    today’s modern era, we all have a shortage of time to take\ncare of our parents\
    \ who are very old, due to which they\ndepend more on IoT-based new wearable sensors.\
    \ Elderly\npeople need more health monitoring so that we can quickly\nidentify\
    \ and cure, whatever side effects they have such as\nincreased blood pressure,\
    \ body temperature, heart disease,\netc., by the doctors within the time. So in\
    \ such a situation,\nby sensing the data from the body of the elderly people,\n\
    with the help of sensors and communication techniques we\ncan forward it for further\
    \ processing. The size and weight\nof these sensor nodes are so small that they\
    \ are very easy to\ncarry and they can automatically sense the data [1]. To\n\
    operate them, the patient does not even have to do the\nmanual effort from outside.\
    \ However, these sensors are\nmore sensitive which sometimes stops working on\
    \ the\npower shortage or environmental hazards and the result is\n& Navneet Verma\n\

    system failure [2]. In Fig. 1, it was demonstrated that how\nIoT sensors and technology\
    \ are working in the HealthCare\narea.\nSmart Healthcare is an intelligent infrastructure\
    \ that\ntransfers information with the help of an IoT system and\nalso implements\
    \ processing from cloud and fog computing.\nIn various applications, we can use\
    \ HealthCare with IoT\nlike, diagnosis and elderly treatment, health management\n\
    and managing chronic diseases, disease avoidance and risk\nmonitoring, smart hospitals,\
    \ virtual assistants, reducing\nurgent situation waiting times, assisting drug\
    \ research, etc.\nIBM is the ﬁrst to introduce the Smart Healthcare concept\n\
    [3] in 2009. No doubt the Internet of Things (IoT) among\nthe wide stimulating\
    \ areas of investigation for the engi-\nneering\nsociety\nand\ndevice\nmanufacturing\n\
    business.\nWhereas with the help of established internet, we can\nconnect two\
    \ devices to communicate and that too with the\nhelp of the intervention of a\
    \ human. While IoT connects all\nsorts of devices ‘‘Things’’ into a broad network\
    \ of inter-\nrelated computing intellect without the involvement of a\nhuman.\
    \ The growth of the IoT industry is demonstrated in\nFig. 2, and various IoT elements\
    \ with technology are pre-\nsent in Fig. 3.\nOverview of IoT Protocols and Architecture\n\
    Today, we are using internet TCP/IP protocol suite for\nnetwork communication\
    \ and billions of IoT devices can\nwork because it is connected through the internet.\
    \ IoT\nprotocols are an essential element of the IoT technology\nstack and without\
    \ them, the hardware connected to it is\nuseless. Because the IoT protocols only\
    \ tell data exchange\nin a structured and meaningful way. Whatever IoT is today\n\
    is due to its essential characteristics like communication\nbetween sensors, equipment,\
    \ servers, gateways, and end\nuser’s applications. Although the IoT protocols\
    \ enable this\nall smart stuff to talk and interact. Though the availability\n\
    of present Internet communications is free and the biggest\nconstraint for any\
    \ IoT device even today is that it is too\nheavy and a power-consuming process\
    \ for any IoT use\ncase. The application layer works as an association\nbetween\
    \ the user and sensor that is needed for the appli-\ncation. ‘‘Constrained Application\
    \ Protocol (CoAP) was\ndesigned to translate the HTTP model so that it could be\n\
    used in restrictive devices and network environments.\nCoAP relies on the User\
    \ Datagram Protocol (UDP) for\nFig. 1 IoT in HealthCare\nFig. 2 Growth of IoT\n\
    Fig. 3 IoT Elements with Technology\n246\nJ. Inst. Eng. India Ser. B (February\
    \ 2022) 103(1):245–257\n123\nestablishing secure communication between endpoints.\n\
    Apart from transferring IoT data, CoAP leverages Data-\ngram Transport Layer Security\
    \ (DTLS) for the secure\nexchange of messages in the transport layer’’[4, 5].\
    \ CoAP\nis more efﬁcient when used in arrangement with 6LoW-\nPAN, a lighter version\
    \ of the traditional HTTP protocol.\n‘‘Message Queuing Telemetry Transport-(MQTT)’’\
    \ is a\nlightweight publication/subscription type messaging pro-\ntocol. MQTT’s\
    \ design is simple and lightweight, and it is\nspecially designed for battery-powered\
    \ devices, providing\nsmall power consumption for devices. It works over TCP,\n\
    and it cannot be used with all types of IoT applications.\nMoreover, it uses text\
    \ for topic names, which increases its\noverhead. Once there is physical connectivity\
    \ done, then\nwith a unique method, all the devices can be separated\nfrom operating\
    \ in their range. The network address has a\ncritical role to identify each computer\
    \ that is associated\nwith the same router. Each alliance in IoT has its network\n\
    address; for occurrence, ZigBee is one alliance with its\nnetwork addresses. Like\
    \ this, ‘‘BLE and Z-Wave’’ are\nhaving their network addresses according to their\
    \ envi-\nronments. ‘‘6LoWPAN (IPv6 Low Power Wireless Per-\nsonal Area Network)’’\
    \ devices also function on IEEE\n802.15.4, but their network stack is with IP\
    \ connectivity\n(IPv6). With effective physical layer standards, we can\nachieve\
    \ all this like more devices in a single environment\nand low power consumption,\
    \ longer battery life, lower\nbandwidth consumption, the ability to connect smaller\
    \ and\nlighter devices. ‘‘Near Field Communication (NFC), IEEE\n802.15.1 (Bluetooth\
    \ Low Energy (BLE) – Bluetooth 4.0),\nIEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, WirelessHART,\
    \ Mi-\nWi),’’ etc., are the standards set by deﬁnite bodies such as\nproprietary\
    \ vendors (Z-Wave by SIGMA DESIGNS) and\nIEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics\
    \ Engineers).\nIoT architecture is divided into ﬁve layers [6] as shown\nin Fig.\
    \ 4, and the architecture of IoT in HealthCare is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 5. The\
    \ responsibilities of different\nlayers in IoT architecture are:\nI.\nPerception\
    \ layer The perception layer is like a physical\nlayer, or we can also call it\
    \ the device layer. On this\nlayer, all sensors like RFID, infrared sensors. barcode\
    \ is\nscanned and collect data from the sensor node to\nforward it to the network\
    \ layer further.\nII.\nNetwork layer In IoT architecture, the network layer is\n\
    also called as transmission layer. It works by sending\nthe data received from\
    \ the perception layer to the\nprocessing unit securely. The transmission standard\n\
    can be wired and wireless to send data securely and\nthis layer use 3G, wi-ﬁ,\
    \ Bluetooth, and Zigbee\ntechnology. Thus, the data are then forwarded to the\n\
    middleware layer.\nIII.\nMiddleware layer One device of IoT connects to the\n\
    other device only when both provide the same type of\nservices. The middleware\
    \ layer has the responsibility\nto connect it to the database by keeping in mind\
    \ the\nservice management. Further, computation and deci-\nsion-making are also\
    \ done by the same middleware\nlayer.\nIV.\nApplication layer This layer comes\
    \ up with the global\nmanagement service. As per the device applications\nlike\
    \ it can be smart farming, smart health, smart\nhome, intelligent transportation,\
    \ smart city, etc.\nV.\nBusiness layer The business layer helps in creating a\n\
    business model, graph, ﬂowchart, etc., for different\nbusiness models from the\
    \ output received from this\nlayer, which is useful in determining the further\n\
    business strategies.\nApplications of IoT in HealthCare\nIoT in the HealthCare\
    \ ﬁeld provides applications that can\nbe separated into two sections [7, 8];\n\

    \ Eng. India Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n247\n123\nI.\nSingle condition\
    \ observation, e.g., Glucose level mon-\nitoring,\nelectrocardiogram\nsensing,\n\
    blood\npressure\nsensing, body temperature sensing, oxygen value\nsensing ii)\
    \ Clustered condition observation, e.g., Reha-\nbilitation management, medication\
    \ system, wheelchair\nsystem, imminent healthcare, smartphone healthcare\nsolutions.\n\
    Further for general HealthCare, lots of apps are avail-\nable like;\nGoogle Fit\n\
    It is a health-tracking application. It is the only set of\napplication programming\
    \ interfaces (API) that combine\ndata from multiple devices and apps. API is a\
    \ computing\nedge that deﬁnes exchanges of data between multiple\nsoftware. Google\
    \ ﬁt uses sensors of a user’s mobile devices\nto witness our physical ﬁtness behavior\
    \ for an instance\nrunning, walking, cycling, and many more. As per the\nuser’s\
    \ ﬁtness objective, they measured against a wide-\nspread view of their ﬁtness\
    \ level.\nECG Self Monitoring\nThe Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors calculate the\
    \ bio-\npotential that is caused by electrical signals, and it controls\nthe expansion\
    \ and contraction of the heart chambers. It is\nimplemented in a health checkup\
    \ procedure.\nPedometer\nThis device counts every step of a person by detecting\
    \ the\nmovement of the person’s hands and hips. The movement\nof a body is observed\
    \ by attaching a enclose of reference\nwhich consists of an intangible coordinate\
    \ system, to a\nviewer and measuring the change in position of the body\nrelative\
    \ to the enclose with the change in time. The tech-\nnology for a pedometer includes\
    \ a mechanical sensor and\nsoftware to count the number of steps. Today, Micro-\n\
    electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and compli-\ncated software are to be\
    \ used for the same purpose.\nNoom-Walk\nNoom Walk is similar to a pedometer as\
    \ it counts steps all\nover the day. It does not use GPS technology, so the app\n\
    uses less battery and after counting steps for 24 h, Noom\nWalk uses around the\
    \ equal battery life as a GPS-enabled\napp just for few minutes.\nWater Your Body\n\
    This app is created to remind a person to drink a certain\namount of water every\
    \ day. This app is based on a lot of\npredeﬁned algorithms that take some related\
    \ information\nfrom a user for instance weight, height, etc., to set remin-\n\
    ders for the users. Some of them are also used some\ntracking components to track\
    \ the temperature of a body and\nas well as energy is being exhausted from a body.\n\
    Instant Heart Rate\nBasically, this application and technology are quite similar\n\
    to the technology which is being used in Heart rate mon-\nitoring. For instance,\
    \ some predeﬁned algorithms and\nsoftware are used in this. The main quality of\
    \ this appli-\ncation is to measure heart rate instantly or in a fraction of a\n\
    second.\nFinger Print Thermometer\nIt is a sensor-based application that takes\
    \ a user’s ﬁnger to\ndetect body temperature and pressure. It recognizes the\n\
    ﬁnger which we press on the display panel. These sensors\ncan permit users to\
    \ just place their ﬁnger on the screen and\nrecognize the print, rather than on\
    \ a button. Random net-\nworks of a hybrid nanostructure stand on ultra-long silver\n\
    nanoﬁbers, and ﬁne silver nanowires are used to produce\nclear, ﬂexible electrodes\
    \ of this multitasking sensor array.\nOn track Diabetes\nThis application connects\
    \ to Dexcom-glucometer to track\nthe level of blood sugar. A person can also give\
    \ related\ninformation based on steps, exercise levels, meals, etc.\nMotivation\n\
    When a device is associated with the internet, it means that\ncan send and/or\
    \ receive information. This ability to send\nand/or receive information makes\
    \ devices smarter. IoT in\nHealthCare is gaining more attention due to the advance-\n\
    ment in the development of IoT devices. Fortune Business\nInsight says that the\
    \ market will go up to USD 176.82\nbillion by 2026 and it was USD 30.96 in 2018.\
    \ The market\nis predicted to rise at a CAGR of 33% in the estimated\nperiod (2019–2026).\
    \ The integration of AI with IoT is the\nvital feature driving the IoT in HealthCare\
    \ market exten-\nsion. Asia Paciﬁc area is probable to grasp the maximum\nmarket\
    \ share. As per our knowledge, in this paper, we\ndescribe the existing IoT structural\
    \ design and communi-\ncation techniques in HealthCare Monitoring. Application\n\
    area of IoT devices is going to be increased in our daily life\n248\nJ. Inst.\
    \ Eng. India Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n123\nlike SmartHome, HealthCare,\
    \ Remote Monitoring, etc.,\nand various types of technology platforms are being\
    \ used\nfor the architecture of IoT along with this various com-\nmunication protocols.\
    \ As our focused area is Smart\nHealthCare, hence, this ﬁeld needs to be optimized.\
    \ If\ncommunication technique challenges and accurate data\ntransmission are not\
    \ addressed, then we will fail to rec-\nognize the disease at the right time.\
    \ These points motivated\nus to bring forward this review work taking into consid-\n\
    eration various parameters like Coverage area, transmis-\nsion range, accurate\
    \ data as futuristic solutions. To make\navailable the readers through an explanation\
    \ of the dis-\nsimilar work available in this ﬁeld of HealthCare in IoT\nwhich\
    \ helps to adapt these methods in solving communi-\ncation and accuracy of data\
    \ problems in future. In this\nCOVID-19 situation, today when we cannot physically\n\
    take care of our elders and near dear ones, then such remote\nmonitory system\
    \ can be most effective, just the high-speed\ninternet should be facilitated.\
    \ Researchers will get the help\nto explore more to address solutions in approaching\
    \ days.\nAs per the report of Deloitte and NASSCOM, Fig. 6\nexhibits the number\
    \ of IoT-enabled devices growth per\nyear and the CAGR growth rate which is almost\
    \ 33%.\nLiterature Survey\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\nBLE is an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ and low latency protocol\nbecause of its single-hop transmission feature. In\
    \ this paper\n[9], the author has compared some microcontrollers for the\ngateway\
    \ node and has chosen the MCU node based on its\nspeciﬁcation. Sensed data from\
    \ patient’s body stored on an\nandroid app with the help of Bluetooth Low Energy\
    \ (BLE).\nBLE also provides Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for\ndata security,\
    \ and this same app forwarded the collected\ndata on the cloud for further reference.\
    \ In this paper, the\nauthor proposed a reliable system at a low cost. In another\n\
    experiment [10], the author has sent patient data from three\ndifferent methods\
    \ like BLE, Wi-Fi, GSM to the mobile app\nby making RPi3 a gateway node, so that\
    \ if one data is lost\nfrom one method, the data from the remaining method\ncould\
    \ be received. And ﬁnally, web application software\nhas been proposed to provide\
    \ an interface for cloud data-\nbases. In this work [11], we observed that the\
    \ working of\nthe BLE protocol is better in the case of latency and energy\nparameters.\n\
    Drawbacks\nThe early-stage disease prediction method is not present in\nthe above\
    \ work, and all patients’ complete sensed data are\nstored on the cloud without\
    \ any data analysis which may\nincrease the big data problem on the cloud in the\
    \ future.\nAlso, BLE supports single-hop transmission which is not so\nmuch reliable,\
    \ as an end-to-end transmission depends upon\nthe working of intermediate nodes.\n\
    Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1)\nThis paper [12]shows, that IoT helps a lot to reduce\
    \ deaths\ndue to heart attack, here the entire patient monitoring\nsystem is separated\
    \ into two steps which are data acquisi-\ntion and data transmission. In the data\
    \ acquisition part, data\nforwarded into four different modules by checking the\n\
    patient’s Electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse rate, heart rate,\nblood fat, blood pressure,\
    \ patient location, and blood glu-\ncose. These modules are synchronous uninterrupted\
    \ com-\nmunication for all data, uninterrupted communication in\nspecial slots,\
    \ transmission on patient demand, and event-\ntriggered transmission. At last,\
    \ the implementation was\nperformed on a prototype, in which the monitoring work\n\
    was done with the help of Java application in Android\nsmartphone on sensed data\
    \ which was sent via Bluetooth\nand data were left on the server-side for monitoring\
    \ of\ndoctors.\nDrawbacks\nIt has also been observed that Bluetooth is not adaptable\
    \ for\nlong-range transmission [13]. BLE and Bluetooth work on\nthe same frequency\
    \ and range, but the transmission rate in\nthe case of Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1)\
    \ is up to 1- 3 Mbit/s,\nwhereas in BLE it is 1 Mbit/s.\nZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4)\n\
    The contribution of master–slave architecture [14], in IoT,\nplays a signiﬁcant\
    \ task. The slave node passes on the dif-\nferent data readings to the sub-master\
    \ node with the help of\nFig. 6 Number of connected device per year\nJ. Inst.\
    \ Eng. India Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n249\n123\nZigBee, which is\
    \ a good protocol for small distance com-\nmunication, followed by the sub-master\
    \ node, send the data\nwhich was received from the slave node to the master node,\n\
    which is at a much greater distance and here sometimes due\nto lack of cellular\
    \ network, therefore, LoRawan protocol\nhas been used. The accuracy of the ZigBee\
    \ protocol\nexplained in this paper [15], during communication, such\nas accurate\
    \ location detection by ZigBee terminal when it\npasses through ZigBee router\
    \ area. When sensed data of\npatients are compared with manual reading, almost\
    \ 99\npercent of the matches took place. On a similar standard,\none more technology\
    \ is used for communication [16], the\nauthor has proposed an IoT-based biomedical\
    \ kit which is\nvery cheap. As well as it can be implemented on a lot of\npeople\
    \ simultaneously. The basic platform in this system is\nRaspberry Pi 3, and it\
    \ was connected to a wireless trans-\nceiver ‘‘nRF24L01 (IEEE 802.15.4)’’ and\
    \ microcontroller\nMSP430G2553 for data sensing and transmission. The\nauthor\
    \ has also stated in this paper that cost, power con-\nsumption, standby mode,\
    \ and data transmission rate wise\nnRF is best instead of ZigBee and BLE. So when\
    \ we talk\nabout data accuracy, we found that ZigBee performance is\ngood, and\
    \ based on power consumption, standby mode, and\ndata transmission rate parameters-\
    \ nRF is good.\nDrawbacks\nHere, we can see that both Zigbee and nRF are designed\
    \ for\nsmall-distance communication and the data rate of ZigBee\nis 250 kbit/s.\n\
    Sigfox/LoRa/NB-IoT under LPWAN\nBeneﬁts of Sigfox, LoRa, and NB-IoT protocols\
    \ [13] such\nas battery life, cost, and range of radio communication,\nunder the\
    \ low power wide area networks (LPWAN) cate-\ngory. LoRaWan uses AES 128b for\
    \ encryption and NB-IoT\nuses LTE encryption, but Sigfox has no authentication\
    \ or\nencryption. A new architecture [17] has been proposed for\nSmart HealthCare,\
    \ in which communication takes place\nwith the help of LoRa connectivity to Fog\
    \ Computing. It\nhas been observed that the monitoring of remote area\npatients\
    \ can be forwarded to several kilometers away also;\nthis system does not allow\
    \ too much burden of data on the\ncloud and is also a good example of energy efﬁciency.\
    \ In\nthis research work [18], a channel access mechanism\nsolution is provided\
    \ to reduce the collisions, and the focus\narea of this work is to analyze the\
    \ scalability of LoRa\ntechnology. No doubt the Sigfox/LoRa/NB-IoT protocols\n\
    under the LPWAN category are good.\nDrawbacks\nSince the NB-IoT commercial deployment\
    \ is very less in\nHealthCare, so its lifetime and performance are not sure\n\
    whether it is good or not. Another challenge is internet\nconnectivity in a remote\
    \ area, and it is expected that 5G\ncommunication will be able to solve this.\
    \ The common\ndrawback in the above-cited papers is that they are just\nworking\
    \ on the communication part there is no mechanism\nto detect the disease in the\
    \ early stage.\nMQTT\nIn this work [19], throughput and end-to-end delay\nparameters\
    \ were taken for a comparison between Message\nQueue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)\
    \ and HTTP. To build\nthe simulation environment, OMNET ? ? network sim-\nulation\
    \ was used and it described that MQTT protocol\nperforms better as compared to\
    \ HTTP. Again in this related\npaper [20], MQTTT has been used for health monitoring.\n\
    Firstly, a wearable device receives the health-related data\nfrom the sensors\
    \ and then by customizing the data, forward\nit to the cloud because of the MQTT\
    \ protocol. In addition\nto this, a fuzzy classiﬁer [21] is used to receive the\
    \ con-\ntinued data from the sensor as well as for the data ﬁltering\ntask, so\
    \ that only a calculated amount of data is to be sent\non the cloud.\nDrawbacks\n\
    More power consumption is required by MQTT and\nanother issue is that it uses\
    \ text to topic name which\nincreases its message overhead.\nCoAP\nThe Constrained\
    \ Application Protocol (CoAP) is a web\ntransfer protocol that is used for constrained\
    \ nodes within\nconstrained networks, which is having low bandwidth and\nlow availability.\
    \ It is similar to HTTP protocol. The author\n[22] has given an example of a hybrid\
    \ system in this paper.\nThis hybrid system is made up using both 6LoWPan and\n\
    CoAP protocols, due to which the efﬁciency of this hybrid\nsystem has increased\
    \ up to a great extent. Similarly [23],\nthe author has used CoAP as the protocol\
    \ of an application\nlayer and implementing it under 6LoWPan network on\nContiki\
    \ OS. Here, the performance is quite satisfactory and\nit was concluded that CoAP\
    \ is a reliable and effective\napplication protocol.\n250\nJ. Inst. Eng. India\
    \ Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n123\nDrawbacks\nCoAP is not good in congestion\
    \ control mechanism and\nhaving poor interoperability with other devices.\nMiscellaneous\n\
    In this system [24], the author has mainly explained the\nrole of IoT in the health\
    \ care monitoring of elderly people.\nThe process of sensing the heart rate and\
    \ body temperature\nof the elderly by making an Arduino do it yourself (DIY)\n\
    board is the base. Besides, sensed data have been stored on\nthe cloud for further\
    \ graph plotting and emergency notiﬁ-\ncation. In this research, it has also been\
    \ said to create a\nfuture model in which the decision-making algorithm of\nmachine\
    \ learning will be used.\nIn the same way, the Raspberry Pi platform has been\n\
    used [25], the author has given the proposal of an IoT-\nbased system keeping\
    \ in mind the elderly and disabled\npeople who speak a very low sound. To create\
    \ this system,\nRaspberry Pi is connected with a GPIO interface, which\npatients\
    \ can access from their smartphone. With the help of\nthe internet, this system\
    \ sends pre-recorded audio messages\nto hospital staff or relatives, so that help\
    \ can be delivered in\ntime.\nIn this work [26, 27], hybrid system is made up\
    \ using\nboth 6LoWPAN and MQTT protocols, where 6LoWPAN\nis used for framing and\
    \ for internal communication MQTT\nis used. In this work [28], a new protocol\
    \ was proposed and\nits performance was checked on the NS-2 simulator and\nresults\
    \ show that it is good in energy-saving and network\nlifetime parameters.\nML\
    \ in HealthCare\nIn this paper [31], the author has focused on how to use\nsensed\
    \ data from the cloud efﬁciently. For example, here\nonly the database of patients\
    \ with diabetes has been\nresearched to indicate that the dataset is a severe\
    \ disease of\ndiabetes and which data set tells it to be early-stage of\ndiabetes.\
    \ Here, the author has used various classiﬁer\nschemes of ML-like decision tree,\
    \ K-NN, SVM and ﬁnally\npropose a Fuzzy Rule-Based Neural Classiﬁer.\nRandom forest\
    \ classiﬁer and IoT [34] can perform well\nin the healthcare system. It has been\
    \ demonstrated that how\nto improve the interactivity between the patients and\
    \ the\ndoctors. For the reliability of this process, the author has\nperformed\
    \ experiments on datasets of various diseases, like\ndiabetes, breast cancer,\
    \ surgery, thyroid, spect-heart, heart\ndisease, liver disorder, and dermatology.\
    \ The author has\nused different algorithms of machine learning over differ-\n\
    ent datasets such as Support Vector Machine, K-NN,\nDecision Trees, MLP, and Random\
    \ Forest. The best results\nthat we have come across are through the random forest\n\
    technique of machine learning and the average results are\nalso good on different\
    \ disease data sets. In the future, if we\nuse a large data set, then maybe some\
    \ other algorithm of\nmachine learning can give better results.\nIn heart care\
    \ disease [35], Fog-based HealthCare with\ndeep learning technique is a unique\
    \ Health Fog system,\nespecially for heart patients, in which the Ensemble\nmethod\
    \ of deep learning has been used on edge computing\ndevices. For high precision,\
    \ tremendous compute resources\n(CPU and GPU) are used for instruction and forecast.\
    \ In the\nfuture, this architecture could be used for other fog com-\nputing applications\
    \ such as weather forecasting, agricul-\nture, smart city, trafﬁc management,\
    \ and other HealthCare\nissues such as cancer, diabetes, and hepatitis, which\
    \ can\nsupply skillful results.\nA multi-agent system [36] has been described\
    \ as ﬂexi-\nble, reliable, and energy-efﬁcient. Here, the focus is on the\ndata\
    \ reduction algorithm, so that a reduced set of data is\nprepared, which is very\
    \ similar to the original data set. By\nusing this above-said method, we will\
    \ not have the\nrequirement of separate external memory. For the imple-\nmentation\
    \ of this system, Java language has been used in\nthe JADE environment and the\
    \ data reduction ratio has\nbeen calculated up to 80 percent.\nANN-based IoT-enabled\
    \ HealthCare system framework\nis demonstrated [37], and the accuracy of the developed\n\
    model is 90.54% for a healthy person and 87.88% for a\npatient with diabetes and\
    \ kidney disease. ANN Technique\nof Machine Learning especially focused on Sleep\
    \ Apnea\ndisease [38], which is an event detection system also a\ngood idea. Different\
    \ sensors are used for data collection\npurposes like MEMS-based accelerometers\
    \ and Industrial\nSpiro-meter. Only ACC data are used to train the system,\nand\
    \ for good results, the author has suggested that more\nsensors can be used for\
    \ monitoring purposes in the future.\nIn this work [39], the Deep Neural Network\
    \ technique\nwas used here to extract the features from EEG, ECG,\nTemperature,\
    \ and Pulse Rate, and the accuracy of the\nmodel was found at 97.5%. To ﬁnd the\
    \ abnormality in the\nKidney [40], FPGA-based IoT-enabled ultrasound images\n\
    were used along with a Support Vector Machine classiﬁer\nto know the accuracy\
    \ of the system. Similarly, k-means\nalgorithm of machine learning is used to\
    \ predict the\nupcoming situation [14].\nIn Table 3, we demonstrated various ML\
    \ algorithms and\napplication areas.\nIn the comparison graph shown below in Fig.\
    \ 7, we have\ncompared the accuracy value of the diabetes dataset\n[41–45] given\
    \ in different papers by various classiﬁcation\nmethods of machine learning like\
    \ SVM, K-NN, Decision\nTree, Naive–Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random\nForest.\n\
    J. Inst. Eng. India Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n251\n123\nChallenges\
    \ with IoT in Healthcare\nI.\nData security and isolation\nII.\nIntegration: various\
    \ devices and protocols\nIII.\nNetwork lifetime\nIV.\nData overload and accuracy\n\
    V.\nCost\nThese three checks are very important for data security and\nPrivacy,\
    \ i.e., authentication, conﬁdentiality, and integrity.\nFor Data security [34,\
    \ 46, 47], either we talk about Fog\nComputing, Cloud computing, and Direct transmission,\n\
    such algorithms do necessitate large storage capacity levels\nwhere cloud computing\
    \ up to an extent can solve this large\nmemory requirement [48]. Sometimes the\
    \ data are much\nclassiﬁed, and it might become a big difﬁculty if stolen or\n\
    compromised. Most security depends upon the developers\nof the devices, but we\
    \ also need some new security\nmethods [49, 50]. IoT networks in hospitals are\
    \ extensively\nusing 6LoWPAN with ‘‘RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for\nLow Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks)’’. Storage requirements\ncan be met by using motes ROM.\
    \ But still using more\ncapacity memory, we can control a few more attacks and\n\
    can reduce the issue of security further. Other solutions\ncould be private cloud\
    \ and data aggregation techniques. In\nother words, it should be in the practice\
    \ and process of all\nof us that we conﬁrm that the data cannot be used and\n\
    accessed by any unauthorized individual and parties.\nSecurity of data guarantees\
    \ that the data are reliable and\naccurate whenever it is needed by authorized\
    \ access. A\ndata security plan involves aspects such as gathering only\nthe necessary\
    \ data, safe maintenance and demolishes any\ndata that is no longer needed. These\
    \ steps will assist any\nbusiness to meet the legal commitment of possessing\n\
    responsive data. Appropriate use of data is deﬁned by data\nprivacy in an appropriate\
    \ approach [51]. The IoT system\ncan function and convey information via an online\n\
    approach only when devices are securely connected to a\ncommunication network.\
    \ Some of them as given below\n[52]:\n•\nBluetooth The IEEE 802.15.1 standard\
    \ is an exclusive\nopen wireless technology standard for exchanging data\nover\
    \ a short distance. Bluetooth radio adopts the\nFrequency Hopping Spread Spectrum—FHSS.\
    \ The\ntransmit distance of this technology is directly propor-\ntional to the\
    \ transmit power.\n•\nWi-Fi The IEEE 802.11 network is an arrangement of\nthe\
    \ Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). In low\nband mode, three variables of IEEE\
    \ 802.11(b, g, n) are\npresent, which can transmit data from 11 Mbps and up\n\
    to 54 M bps and goes up to 32 m indoors and 95 m\noutdoor.\n•\nCellular Cellular\
    \ networks have become more popular\nin recent years. It uses radio waves for\
    \ transferring\ninformation. In the 1980’s, it was started by the name of\n1G\
    \ which was an analog system, then the 2G-Digital\nsystem comes into existence,\
    \ then 3G and after that 4G\ncellular network generation came which is based on\n\
    LTE and Wi-Max network standards.\nSome of the reasons behind the data overload\
    \ are given\nbelow:\n•\nA lot of new information is created continuously.\n•\n\
    The pressure to create and compete in information\nprovision leading to a quantity\
    \ over quality effect in\nmany industries\n•\nThe simplicity in online information\
    \ sharing, creating\nand duplicating.\n•\nThe exponential rise in channels to\
    \ collect information\nby; print media, radio, websites, television, e-mail, RSS\n\
    feeds, mobile telephony, etc.\n•\nIncreasing in the weight of historical data\
    \ available to\nus.\n•\nHigh volumes of contradictory, conﬂicting, and plain\n\
    old erroneous information.\nFig. 7 Accuracy comparison\n252\nJ. Inst. Eng. India\
    \ Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n123\n•\nNo simple methodologies for comparing,\
    \ quickly\nprocessing, and evaluating information sources.\n•\nTo fall short in\
    \ clear structure in groups of information\nand poor or bad clues as to the associations\
    \ between\nthose groups.\nA node in an IoT network requires a lot of energy as\n\
    well as a storage area to make it so capable. In this work\n[53], for energy efﬁciency\
    \ especially for wearable devices\nATTINY85 sensor is used which results in the\
    \ long life of a\n220 mAh battery. Samsung Exynos 5422, a smart Gate-\nway, has\
    \ also been used, which is energy efﬁcient as well\nas fast [54] due to the processor\
    \ installed in it. This system\ncan understand only FHIR datasets ﬁles, so in\
    \ the future, it\ncan be made compatible with CSV datasets, and the\nworking of\
    \ Gateway can also be made more accurate by\nassociating it with Artiﬁcial Intelligence.\
    \ This can be done\nby reducing the computational task and simultaneously\nwithout\
    \ losing the accuracy of the information [55], and\nthis can also be achieved\
    \ by traveling the shortest path by\ndata packets with the help of FUZZY rules\
    \ [56]. Data\noverload will occur when the input data will be larger than\nits\
    \ processing capacity. When data overloads, then the\nreduction in data started\
    \ to occur. As data accuracy is one\nof the important features of data quality.\
    \ This tells us that\nthe data values that have been stored for the object are\
    \ also\ncorrect. To be correct, data values must be true values and\nmust be represented\
    \ in a steady and explicit form. The\naccuracy will always be if the data values\
    \ are correct. Since\n100% of data accuracy is not possible anyhow. There will\n\
    always be some amount of data in the inaccurate database.\nThe application area\
    \ of all protocols is also different from\nthe perspective of these parameters\
    \ like coverage area,\ntransmission range, and operational bandwidth. A global\n\
    standard can also be made to resolve this issue. Overload of\ndata and lack of\
    \ accurate data on the cloud, fog, and\ngateway devices is also a challenge for\
    \ IoT in healthcare.\nFor data quality and accuracy issues, Machine Learning\n\
    Technology can be a good solution. Although work has\nbeen started in this direction,\
    \ it can be improved further.\nWhenever we talk about advancement in the IoT ﬁeld,\
    \ it\ndirectly affects the cost of the system. Whether we argue\non a new protocol\
    \ design, a new IoT wearable device, on a\nsensor that fulﬁlls multiple purposes;\
    \ these are all cost-\ndependent areas. Device developers should also pay special\n\
    attention to this direction.\nSo IoT networks require these characteristics [57]\
    \ such\nas:\n•\nThe capacity to connect a large number of heteroge-\nneous elements\
    \ Thousands to millions of devices will be\nneeded to build a large IoT system,\
    \ and all these\ndevices must also be entirely diverse from each other.\nMost\
    \ of the IoT devices are diverse depends upon the\ninput and output layout of\
    \ particulars and the commu-\nnication protocols. So to make a reliable IoT system,\n\
    inter-device communication, interoperable devices, and\nanalysis of the data from\
    \ all diverse devices is a big\nchallenge.\n•\nHigh reliability On each layer\
    \ of IoT, reliability is\nrequired because of the proper working of the system\n\
    and aims toward the achievement of service delivery\nensured by it.\n•\nReal-time\
    \ data transmission with minimum delays\nThese devices transmit real-time data\
    \ to the base\nstation (BS), which can further be used in different\napplications\
    \ and that too with a minimum delay such as\nabnormality discovery. Under adequate\
    \ power accessi-\nbility, wireless transmissions from sensors can be\nscheduled\
    \ at regular time intervals to maintain real-\ntime data acquisition.\n•\nThe\
    \ ability to protect all data ﬂows Diverse security\nmethods are involved in all\
    \ layers of IoT because data\nsecurity is a big concern for IoT.\n•\nThe ability\
    \ to conﬁgure applications Sensors get\noutdated from time to time, and there\
    \ are chances of\nmalfunction, so it is better to conﬁgure them from time\nto\
    \ time according to the application.\n•\nDevice-level monitoring and trafﬁc management\
    \ Mon-\nitoring all activates of connected devices and managing\nall trafﬁc or\
    \ we can say proper routing should be there.\n•\nCost-effectiveness for a large\
    \ number of connected\nobjects As we add more new devices to the network, the\n\
    cost of the system will also increase. That is why either\nthese devices support\
    \ multiple applications or they do\nnot cost much.\nWell, these are the consequences\
    \ by which it becomes\nmore complex.\nProblems in existing System\nVarious factors\
    \ affect the IoT in HealthCare applications\nlike it requires continuous research\
    \ in every ﬁeld of\nhealthcare to offer a fast and better competence for patients\n\
    for example manufacturing smart devices, fast communi-\ncation techniques, etc.\
    \ IoT has a heterogeneous network\nand due to a lack of standard architecture,\
    \ sometimes it\nbecomes a difﬁcult task to use communication techniques\naccording\
    \ to the applications. Without analytics power, IoT\nis useless which is now becoming\
    \ the biggest source of Big\nData. Deep learning, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Machine\n\
    Learning, and Big data analytics can be used for some\nvalue-added applications\
    \ in IoT. As we can see from\nTable 1, that the professionals working in the HealthCare\n\
    department are getting massive data of the patients with the\nJ. Inst. Eng. India\
    \ Ser. B (February 2022) 103(1):245–257\n253\n123\nhelp of IoT technology either\
    \ on cloud or server, which is\ncreating a data surplus and accuracy problem.\
    \ As well as it\nis wastage of time to deal with irrelevant datasets or values\n\
    at the time of diagnosis. Before sending the whole data to\nthe cloud or diagnosis\
    \ the whole dataset, analysis of\ndatasets or data mining can assist better care\
    \ to the patient.\nAs we found in the literature review that the patient’s data\n\
    are either getting from the direct patient’s sensor device or\nfrom cloud storage\
    \ to diagnose by the doctors. If doctors\nare working on a cloud storage data\
    \ set, then it cannot be a\nreal-time health monitoring system. Sometimes, it\
    \ is very\ndifﬁcult for those who live in remote areas where doctors\nare far\
    \ away from their reach to consult. In those cases, if\nsymptoms arise for some\
    \ serious and common diseases, so\nwithout a doctor’s intervention, the machine\
    \ learning\napproach will be helpful to detect the severity level of the\ndisease.\
    \ So, IoT technology with ML can build precision of\nthe information and disseminate\
    \ more correct and real-time\ninformation to patients. This leads to fewer accidents\
    \ from\nmisperception, better protective concern, and superior\npatient satisfaction.\
    \ So with this feature, we can use IoT in\na well-planned manner in healthcare\
    \ and take it to a new\nlevel. This is the best use of it in healthcare, that\
    \ we should\ndo it for elderly patients with some serious and common\ndiseases.\
    \ In a healthcare monitoring system, the patient\nsimply has to attach the IoT-based\
    \ sensor to their body and\nthe sensor does the rest of the monitoring work itself\
    \ and\nkeeps the report to the doctor and family as well. But\nremote monitoring\
    \ facilities can beneﬁt those people who\nlive in remote areas and doctors are\
    \ far away from their\nreach.\nConclusion and Future Scope\nSo far the utility\
    \ of IoT-enabled technology in Healthcare\nis facing many challenges such as heterogeneity\
    \ of IoT\ndevices, lack of cost-effective smart and accurate medical\nsensor,\
    \ lack of a standard architecture of IoT system, high\nhandling volume data and\
    \ challenge of interoperability, etc.\nThough to prepare IoT for healthcare it\
    \ is necessary to\nsupport IoT interoperability, for this IoT system will have\n\
    to be compatible with all devices, which will require a\nstandard IoT architecture,\
    \ which could do decision-making\ntask itself. When all these challenges are well\
    \ explored,\nthen the researcher can do some new work in it by using\nnew methods\
    \ and technologies, we can increase ‘‘the\napplications of IoT in the HealthCare\
    \ ﬁeld.’’ People who\nreside in remote regions and doctors are far away from\n\
    their reach in that case remote monitoring facilities can be\nbeneﬁtted for those.\
    \ So the selection of a communication\nstandard for HealthCare purpose, especially\
    \ remote moni-\ntoring, will be our ﬁrst important factor in our further\nresearch.\
    \ It is an important factor, and we have shown\nthrough Table 2 the comparison\
    \ between various tech-\nnologies which we are using currently for Healthcare\n\
    Monitoring. Different authors have used different com-\nmunication techniques\
    \ according to the application and\narea of the problem, such as BLE, Bluetooth,\
    \ and ZigBee\nTable 1 Comparison between various Technologies used for Healthcare\

    for small coverage areas, and some authors have described\nsigfox/LoRa/NB-IoT\
    \ techniques are good for low power\nwide area networks as demonstrated in Table\
    \ 1. There is\nvery little focus on Machine Learning for early-stage dis-\nease\
    \ prediction, which is a very important area, without\nwhich we could not be able\
    \ to predict the disease at the\nearly stage. So this will be our second important\
    \ factor in\nour further research like which ML technique can predict\nthe disease\
    \ more accurately. Machine learning techniques\nas demonstrated in Table 3 and\
    \ IoT together can do a\nmiracle in today’s modern technology and especially in\
    \ the\nHealthCare area; if both of them are used with good\nunderstanding, then\
    \ it can create a new benchmark in the\nHealthCare ﬁeld, which can be a boon for\
    \ the HealthCare\nof elder people.\nReferences\n1. S.B. Baker, W. Xiang, I. Atkinson,\

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Many researchers try to make a comparison between various
    Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms based on specific requirements. However, none
    of the reviewed studies proposed a thorough analysis of the variety of comparative
    methods. Since there is a lack of comparison frameworks for IoT platforms, individuals
    or companies have difficulties when selecting a suitable IoT platform matching
    their associated business requirements. In order to support this selection process,
    a set of functional and nonfunctional requirements is identified. A framework
    containing methods in selecting an IoT platform is presented. The methodology
    is based on statistical and visualization techniques to recommend a suitable IoT
    platform. Five IoT platforms: 1) Azure; 2) AWS; 3) SaS; 4) ThingWorx; and 5) Kaa
    IoT are studied to evaluate the performance of the framework. Different comparison
    methods are proposed and a multicriteria decision analysis method was applied
    by using an analytical hierarchical process (AHP). One of the methods clusters
    the functional requirements and compares the IoT platforms based on their ability
    in supporting a specific requirement or not. The K -means clustering was applied
    to determine the clusters of functional requirements. The comparison was made
    based on the hierarchical level of requirements per main requirement. The other
    methods use the following statistical tests: error bar test, one-way Anova test,
    and Tukey’s honest significant difference test. Based on the selected requirements,
    an approach is suggested for which IoT platform can be used. Published in: IEEE

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Internet of Things (IoT) is the
    interconnection of things with the Internet as a fundamental communication system
    in order to provide smart connectivity between the users and the environment [1].
    In an IoT ecosystem, IoT refers to uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual
    representations in an Internet-like structure. The term IoT was coined in 1999
    in the domain of supply chain management by Kevin Ashton [1]. IoT has the potential
    to provide enormous applications in many fields of life. Over time, IoT has been
    embedded in everyday life in order to improve daily lifestyle. Similarly, IoT
    can substantially provide new business models and generate new opportunities to
    enhance our way of living. It has been predicted that the number of devices connected
    to the Internet will reach 50 billion by 2020 [2]. This enormous growth in the
    number of connected devices generates huge amounts of data that need to be stored,
    processed, visualized, and used for decision making, which is commonly managed
    by IoT platforms. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    Get rights and content Abstract The emergence of the paradigm of the Internet
    of Things has underpinned the development of data-driven cyber–physicalsystems
    that collect and process data that is dense both in space and time. The application
    areas of such data-driven IoT systems are numerous and their socio-economic impact
    of great importance as they enable the monitoring and management of processes
    in sectors ranging from urban management to management of the natural environment.
    In this work, we introduce and detail an end-to-end technological framework for
    data-driven IoT systems for landslide monitoring. The framework is articulated
    in three tiers — namely data acquisition, data curation and data presentation
    For each tier we present and detail its design and development aspects; from the
    IoT hardware design and the wireless communication technologies of choice, to
    how Big Data infrastructure and Machine Learning components can be combined to
    support a sophisticated presentation tier that delivers the true added value of
    a system to its final users. The framework is validated, extended and fine-tuned
    by means of two pilots at locations experiencing the impact of different landslide
    types and activity. This work qualitatively improves upon existing methods of
    landslide monitoring and showcases how data-driven IoT systems can pave new pathways
    for interdisciplinary research as well as generate positive impact on modern societies.

    sensorsSystem architectureLPWAN 1. Introduction Internet of Things (IoT) is an
    emerging technological paradigm that enables the massive and seamless interconnection
    of smart objects, things and machines over the Internet. The paradigm refers to
    an ecosystem of technologies applied in multi-sectors including geoscience, agriculture,
    farming, urban development, emergency response, medical, retail, security and
    surveillance that require continuous real-time data acquisition, analysis and
    evaluation. The IoT paradigm is a key enabler towards the cyber–physicalconvergence.
    Small autonomous smart sensors and actuators deployed en masse enable the collection
    of dense data both in space and time. When coupled with technologies for Big Data
    analytics and Machine Learning, it allows the development of data-driven cyber–physical
    systems that can have a profound positive impact on individuals, societies and
    industries. Thus far, the development of IoT systems has been primarily focused
    on the verticals of Smart Cities & Communities; Smart Manufacturing and Supply
    Chains; and Smart Agriculture & Farming. However, IoT systems can significantly
    contribute to the efficient monitoring and management of our natural environment;
    an area whose importance is highlighted ever stronger with the ongoing Climate
    Crisis [1]. Natural phenomena such as landslides can be destructive and can have
    profound negative socio-economic impact. A landslide is defined as a movement
    or rock, earth or debris down a slope [2], [3], [4]. It is a physical system that
    develops through time in several stages driven by different phenomena including
    precipitation, snowmelt, temperature changes, earthquakes [5] and, if at the coast,
    marine processes. In the UK, the most active landslides are at the coast, driven
    by both terrestrial and marine processes. In other areas, such as India, precipitation
    levels are an important triggering factor for landslides. Climate change models
    forecast scenarios that indicate an increase in the triggering conditions for
    landslide occurrence (e.g. high-intensity precipitation events and sea level rise)
    that are indisputably linked to the stability of natural and engineered slopes

    Note the damages inflicted on the public access pathway (top of the cliff), the
    public access building (bottom of the cliff) and the historic Edwardian funicular
    (side of the landslide). As well as loss of life and physical damage, landslides
    can pose significant repeated socio-economic threats in landslide prone areas
    (e.g. [7]) where the built environment and infrastructure are particularly at
    risk in the long term. It is the potential for increased impact that has motivated
    the need for novel and efficient methods of landslide monitoring. Traditional
    landslide monitoring methods and techniques are limited both in technical terms
    (quality and frequency of data) as well as in usability terms (high inferred costs,
    difficulty of deployment, restricted access to areas of interest). 1.1. Setting
    the scene The two pilot areas are on the south coast of England: Bournemouth and
    Barton-on-Sea. Both sites have landslides of different scales where significant
    damage to public infrastructure is reported. East Cliff landslide, Bournemouth,
    Dorset. On 24th April 2016, a landslide occurred on the 35 m high section of the
    East Cliff in Bournemouth, Dorset (Fig. 1). The day before, cracks at the top
    of the cliff had been reported to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council
    (BCP) (Fig. 2) who cordoned off the area, both at the cliff top and at the foot
    of the cliff. The landslide damaged an Edwardian funicular railway as well as
    a toilet block and an array of fences and benches from the top of the cliff [8].
    This event incurred high costs to the local authority for damage control and lengthy
    full-scale clean-up operations that spanned months. BCP council installed coir
    matting to minimise erosion and has employed several monitoring methods. These
    include conducting 6-monthly topographic surveys, visual and digital inspections
    (using LIDAR), and groundwater monitoring. Barton on Sea landslide, Hampshire.
    Much of the frontage at Barton on Sea is subject to ongoing complex landslide
    activity in the cliffs with significant events reported regularly. The area behind
    the cliff is continuously affected and is mostly residential with some businesses
    and infrastructure (Fig. 3 [9]). The cliffs are 1.5 km long and 30–35 m high and
    have been subject to coastal protection and cliff stabilisation works since the
    1930s1 that have cost New Forest District Council (NFDC) significant amount of
    money. NFDC actively monitor and survey the landslide2 with the support of the
    British Geological Survey (BGS) in the near future. Download : Download high-res

    This is an active landslide posing significant risks to the public and near-by
    infrastructure and buildings. The limitations in relation to characterising the
    aforementioned monitoring and control methods include – among others, sparse data
    turnaround and high inferred costs – provided the motivation for researching and
    developing an IoT-enabled system for efficient landslide monitoring. The solution
    ought to be highly scalable, easily deployable and should infer low maintenance
    costs. Additional functional requirements included (as elicited from the stakeholders):
    • The system should be able to monitor the landslide independently of any vegetation
    or other infrastructure (e.g. coir nets) present. • The system should be able
    to provide high fidelity data with centimetre-scale accuracy. • The system should
    be able to allow remote monitoring of the landslide. • It would be desired for
    the data transmission to be wireless. • It would be desired for the data transmission
    to be (near) real time. In this context, the proposal for a solution based on
    a framework combining IoT technologies for sensing and wirelessly transmitting
    data, Big Data infrastructure and Machine Learning for data curation and a sophisticated
    web-based user interface was put forward. Our methodological approach was first
    validated in a proof-of-concept pilot (referred to as Pilot 1) deployed at Bournemouth’s
    East Cliff site that ran successfully for 6 months. An improved and significantly
    extended version of our system has been deployed in a second pilot (referred to
    as Pilot 2) at Barton-on-sea at a location that is closely surveyed by contemporary
    geological methods. The aim of Pilot 2 is to evaluate and compare the performance
    of the framework against these well-established monitoring methods. 1.2. Our contribution
    In this work, we present a technological framework for landslide monitoring which
    employs emerging technologies such as Internet of Things, Big Data analytics and
    Machine Learning. The framework has matured through and been validated in two
    Pilots; one at East Cliff, Bournemouth and one at Barton-on-sea. The framework
    specifies a modular, loosely coupled architecture consisting of three tiers; data
    acquisition, data curation and data presentation (Fig. 4). Download : Download
    high-res image (44KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. The architectural
    tiers of the presented framework. Regarding the data acquisition tier, we detail
    the development of IoT sensing devices for landslide monitoring. We discuss the
    IoT boards that were used (a bespoke board for Pilot 1 and a commercially available
    one for Pilot 2), the wireless communication technologies used (SigFox for Pilot
    1 and LoRa for Pilot 2) as well as the sensors used and their interfacing with
    the boards having in mind energy efficiency (detailed schemas are provided). Regarding
    the data curation tier, we present the technologies used for collecting and handling
    IoT data streams. The backend architecture has been developed in a modular way
    having scalability in mind. Specialised technologies are used for Big Data curation
    and analytics as well as Machine Learning frameworks. The aim is for the backend
    not only to be able to handle streams of geological data from multiple sites,
    but also to be able to produce models that provide insights into landslide mechanisms
    as well as reliable predictions for anticipating future incidents. Regarding the
    data presentation tier, the architecture and design of a web portal is presented.
    Its development has been based on functional requirements provided by specialists
    working on landslides (geotechnical engineers, council assistants and geologists).
    This front-end dynamically pulls data from the data curation tier and supports
    multi-modal data presentation featuring data overlaying with interactive maps
    and user-defined data plots. The introduced data-driven IoT framework contributes
    to the following: factors • It fills the apparent gap for a geological monitoring
    system that continuously provides reliable near-real-time data, and is independent
    of workforce restrictions, accessibility, weather conditions and limitations.
    • It dramatically improves currently employed monitoring methods in terms of ease
    of deployment, scalability, cost efficiency, data precision, granularity of data,
    and agility of use for the end-user. • It provides a state-of-the-art platform
    for real time data acquisition, processing and visualisation that benefits the
    geologists, local government, community and other stakeholders. Finally, we would
    like to note that the framework does not intend to substitute the already existing
    methods, but aims at complementing them and, therefore augments the arsenal of
    available methods. In particular, existing monitoring methods rely upon highly
    sophisticated and expensive equipment of high accuracy and precision that require
    (in several cases) the employment of corresponding specialised expertise. These
    methods, in principle, provide data of high fidelity that are sparse in space
    and time. On the contrary, the proposed framework makes use of highly affordable
    infrastructure that introduces low capital and operational costs, and that can
    be easily deployed. While individual devices are not characterised by the same
    levels of accuracy and precision, the system compensates this by making use of
    state-of-the-art technologies in Big Data analytics and Machine Learning. 2. Related
    work 2.1. Background on landslide monitoring Although, the primary driving force
    of landslides is gravity, the stability of a slope is influenced by a variety
    of other factors including: the material type and strength, lithological structure,
    hydrogeology, the slope angle, earthquakes, meteorological and other environmental
    conditions such as marine processes. Knowledge of these conditions can help to
    predict the location, types, and volumes of potential failures [10], [11]. The
    geological data related to landslides are mostly complex, and data acquisition-devices
    and real-time data transmission network infrastructures must be carefully designed.
    Currently, available landslide monitoring techniques can coarsely be taxonomized
    in methods requiring physical access and methods of remote monitoring [12]. Topographic
    surveys and on-site visual inspection by experts are probably the most commonly
    employed method; however, this method is subject to ease of access and does not
    scale well with respect to area coverage. More accurate methods include the use
    of sophisticated equipment, such as terrestrial laser scanners [13], extensometers
    [14], tensiometers and inclinometers [15] (e.g. [16], [17]). However, these methods
    require specific expertise and introduce high operating costs. Furthermore, these
    methods are also not easily scaled to cover large areas. Remote monitoring methods
    include the use of satellites, either in the form of GPS systems [18] or interferometry
    techniques via synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images [19]. It is worth
    mentioning that apart from the issues already discussed, few of the aforementioned
    methods are able to provide data in real or near-real time. Also, some of these
    methods are not accessible to authorities of local communities either due to them
    requiring high expertise or due to inferred costs. Landslides have been monitored
    throughout the world using a range of technologies over time (e.g. [16], [20],
    [21], [22]). As well as the aforementioned remote sensing techniques and visual
    inspections, traditional instrumented landslide monitoring systems collect information
    on landslide movement as well as conditioning factors such as weather conditions,
    groundwater, the geology and its geotechnical properties and, if at the coast,
    may include the state of the beach and any defences. Instruments include down-borehole
    inclinometers and piezometers, geophysics such as Proactive Infrastructure Monitoring
    and Evaluation (PRIME) systems [23] and weather stations [16]. Some of these technologies
    use telemetric systems but these can be expensive to install and maintain and
    may require connection to mains electricity for continuous use; many rely on manually
    downloading data on site and most require specific expertise. 2.2. Landslide monitoring
    using wireless sensor networks Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are peer-to-peer
    ad-hoc networks consisting of small autonomous sensing devices (a.k.a. sensor
    motes) that are able to carry out complex tasks collaboratively. WSNs are a key
    enabling technology of IoT [24], and their paradigm has contributed a lot in developing
    core IoT technologies such as IEEE802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN. There is abundant literature
    on WSNs being employed in several applications such as smart buildings [25], forest
    fire detection [26] and smart grids [27]. Regarding landslide monitoring with
    WSNs, the line of research presented in [28], [29] is probably the most notable
    one. The authors designed a column that houses several sensors for detecting landslides.
    In particular, the sensor suite consists of: • Dielectric Moisture Sensors: Measure
    water content in the soil. • Pore Pressure Piezometers: Measure groundwater pore
    pressure. • Strain gauges: Measure movement of soil layers attached to the Deep
    Earth Probe (DEP). • Tilt-meter: Measure the movement of soil layers regarding
    creep, slow or sudden movements. • Geophones: Measure vibrations caused during
    a landslide. • Rain Gauges: Measure the effect of rainfall on a slope and therefore,
    the ancillary effects such as pore pressure. • Temperature Sensors: Physical properties
    of soil and water change with temperature, recorded every fifteen minutes. The
    success of these devices was demonstrated by the early detection of a landslide
    in July 2009, providing validation for the authors’ design during a substantial
    rainfall period in India’s monsoon season. Criticisms of this system rely on the
    large physical form factor of the sensor columns (20 meters in length), their
    high energy consumption (the column relies upon a constant, wired power source
    which is backed by a power bank and a solar panel) and their high cost. Following
    the emergence of Internet of Things as a novel ICT paradigm, monitoring systems
    for the physical environment started to employ relevant technologies and approaches.
    One such comparable IoT themed system exists in Panzhihua Airport, located in
    the Sichuan province, China [30]. Similarly to the framework presented in this
    work, this system’s technical architecture also adopted a 3-layer approach; a
    sensor layer, a network layer and an application layer. The sensor layer of the
    system obtained and reported information about the physical geography of the slope,
    such as landslide deformation information like crack displacement, GPS and angle
    deformation and local rainfall data. The network layer included private networks
    employing cabled and wireless technologies, a network management system and an
    Internet-based cloud computing platform. The later was responsible for the transfer
    and processing of data from the sensor layer. The system utilised a total of 5
    extensometers deployed in strategic placements along a fault crack in the slope,
    with one end on the landslide and the other on firmer ground. While the system
    successfully issued warnings for an impeding landslide, it demonstrates several
    limitations compared to the framework presented in this work. Firstly, it comprises
    specialised equipment (such as extensometers) that require specialised expertise
    to be deployed; they also increase the overall cost of the system significantly.
    In our approach, we employ consumer-graded electronics that are abundantly available
    in the market, thus greatly reducing incurred costs and facilitating development
    and deployment. Secondly, we employ LPWAN communication technologies that allow
    for seamless device interconnection to the Internet, therefore reducing the complexity
    of the system, increasing the battery lifetime of the devices, and further reducing
    incurred costs. Finally, the presented framework provisions the use of Big Data
    Analytics and Machine Learning infrastructure in the back-end, therefore greatly
    increasing the scalability of the system, enabling the system to support multiple
    sensing modalities and providing deeper insights to the geological processes that
    trigger landslide incidents. In [32] authors present a landslide monitoring system
    that makes use of wireless sensor networks and the LoRa LPWAN. The focus of this
    work is on the precise geolocation of the nodes of the network, such that the
    motion of the slope is monitored in detail. To this end, authors provide details
    on the sensors they employ (accelerometers, magnetometers, angular rate sensor)
    and the network architecture, consisting of three anchor nodes located at the
    top of the slope that enable the triangulation of the position of each node. While
    this system also uses LoRa and low-powered single board computers, in contrast
    to the presented framework in this work, it does not provide for Internet connectivity
    and does not support any sophisticated infrastructure for curating and leveraging
    upon the collected data. Finally, authors provide little insights on the set up
    of the sensing devices and their expected efficiency in energy consumption. Download

    Comparison of Sigfox, LoRa and NB-IoT [31]. In [34] authors present an IoT-based
    monitoring system employing two different node types; a meteorological node and
    a ground monitoring node. Similarly to our approach, the system makes use of consumer-graded
    electronics, such as LoPy [35] – a developing IoT platform supporting multiple
    wireless communication technologies. The system is detailed in terms of its back-end
    infrastructure, which comprises a lambda architecture that communicates over a
    web interface with a scientific sharing platform. Although not explicitly mentioned,
    the architecture is capable of supporting the training of Machine Learning models
    for landslide forecasting. However, contrary to our presented framework, in [34]
    authors do not include explicitly in their design a front-end component. This
    is a commonly overlooked, yet crucial, component since it allows the end-user
    and the system stakeholders to harvest the added value of the system and collected
    data, e.g. by means of Visual Analytics. Furthermore, in [34] authors do not elaborate
    on the hardware configuration of their sensing devices and their energy efficiency.
    This is a crucial aspect of a monitoring system for the natural environment, since
    deploying and reclaiming devices can be very costly and challenging. Download

    advances have greatly promoted the IoT paradigm in recent years. Regarding IoT
    hardware, the emergence of Single Board Computers, such as the Raspberry Pi and
    the Arduino, have popularised IoT enabling the development of “at home” projects
    by non-specialists. This has led to the growth of the corresponding market with
    new vendors, such as Adafruit and Sparkfun, introducing novel board designs while
    reducing the costs of purchase. Table 1. List of terms and acronyms used. Key

    with a range of 100 m. Corresponding advancements have taken place regarding the
    wireless communication technologies. The landscape of IoT wireless technologies
    initially was dominated by Low Power Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) making use
    of IEEE802.15.4, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and 6LoWPAN. This family of protocols
    was the first to address the device characteristics imposed by the IoT paradigm
    directly (e.g. their highly constrained nature in computational resources and
    connectivity), however, they supported communications over small distances (in
    the order of 100 metres). This necessitated the use of gateways, which in turn
    hindered the scalability of IoT systems. The introduction of Low Power Wide Area
    Networks (LPWANs) substantially changed the landscape. By operating at low sub-GHz
    frequencies, LPWANs support long range wireless communication (in the order of
    tens of kilometres) while still being highly energy efficient. In spite of this
    being achieved at the cost of low baud rates, they achieved network speeds suffice
    for most IoT applications. Furthermore, LPWANs successfully mitigate the issues
    of scalability, thus paving the way for the deployment of large-scale IoT systems.
    Fig. 6 illustrates the layers of IoT protocols prescribed by IEEE and ETSI (European
    Telecommunications Standards Institute). Sigfox [16] was among the few first LPWANs
    to be commercially available. The network is organised in cells, each one covering
    a maximum area of 50 km, allowing up to 140 uplinks and 4 downlinks per device,
    per day. The technology operates as a one-hop star topology although the network
    requires a mobile operator to carry the generated traffic. In the Sigfox business
    model, the network access points are owned by the Sigfox company or official representatives,
    and users need to pay a premium per device per day. LoRa [17] – abbreviation for
    Long Range – is another popular LPWAN. Similarly, to Sigfox, it operates at low,
    sub-GHz frequencies at low duty-cycles, thus addressing the range-vs-energy trade-off.
    The main difference to Sigfox lies in the business model it assumes. The ownership
    and operation of LoRaWAN access points are open to everyone, and therefore, LoRa
    supports the operation of private IoT networks. Certain initiatives, such as The
    Things Network , leverage upon this model in order to develop crowdsourced IoT
    networks spanning across entire regions (the UK network spans across the entire
    country and continues to grow). Complimentary to Sigfox and LoRa – wireless technologies
    that rely upon IoT-specific infrastructure – there are IoT wireless technologies
    being introduced that operate over the existing cellular network. NB-IoT (narrowband
    IoT) is such a technology that focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost,
    long battery life, and high connection density. It makes use of the LTE standard
    but dramatically limits the bandwidth, thus achieving energy efficiency. The great
    advantage of this technology is the fact that it makes use of the existing cellular
    infrastructure that already provides good coverage both indoors and outdoors.

    3. Overview of the landslide monitoring framework and of the two pilots Fig. 7
    depicts the reference architecture of the presented framework. It is articulated
    in three tiers that are loosely coupled with the use of APIs. This provides flexibility
    in fine tuning and adjusting the framework by amending the design of each tier
    and the choice of identical technologies used independently of the rest of the
    system. The data acquisition tier consists of the IoT sensing devices that are
    fitted with specialised sensors and are deployed in an area of interest. The devices
    are autonomous and highly energy efficient, being able to continuously operate
    for an extended period of more than 600 days (see detailed discussion in Section
    4.2). The devices collect geological data, which is then transmitted over a LPWAN
    network to the next tier. The data curation tier employs technologies for efficiently
    storing and managing IoT Big Data streams, as well as for training Machine Learning
    models for landslide monitoring. The architecture assumed is highly scalable and
    can accommodate (and if needed aggregate) data streams from multiple sites as
    well as from external sources, such as weather data. Finally, the data presentation
    tier dynamically retrieves data from the data curation tier visualising them using
    several modalities, such as overlaying data on Google maps, dynamic selection
    of data categories and figure plotting by the end user, cross-referencing data
    from multiple sources, and so on. Each tier is presented in detail in the following
    sections. Design and development for Pilot 1 commenced after a landslide incident
    that took place in 2016 at Bournemouth’s East Cliff. The morphology of the surrounding
    area in Bournemouth is characterised by cliffs that overlook a ten-mile stretch
    of public-access beachfront. The type of soil and local weather conditions – strong
    winds, high air humidity, precipitation levels during winter and high temperature
    variations during summer – make the area prone to landslides. Furthermore, landslide
    incidents pose a significant risk to public safety, as the cliffs and seafront
    are located well within the urban fabric of the town. The aim of Pilot 1, on one
    hand, has been to showcase the capabilities of data-driven IoT-enabled systems
    to the relevant stakeholders and, at the same time, validate the use of relevant
    technologies in application areas that move well-beyond the usual domains – Smart
    Cities, Smart Manufacturing, Smart Agriculture – and into the domain of environmental
    sciences. In this context, validation entailed not only the definition of a data-driven
    system architecture for IoT systems, but also significant engineering challenges
    related to the choice of sensors, energy efficiency and the physical design of
    the sensing devices so as to withstand weather conditions and other adversarial
    elements (e.g. seagulls and rodents are known hazards for any equipment deployed
    on sea-side cliffs). To this end, three devices were deployed on site at carefully
    selected locations, each one demonstrating different characteristics (see Fig.
    11) – one on a mild slope; another one on a steeper slope; while a third one on
    the stone-paved support structure. This enabled us to calibrate and validate the
    configuration of the devices by monitoring locations with different expected geological
    behaviour. Download : Download high-res image (160KB) Download : Download full-size

    the landslide site. The soil humidity and temperature sensors are visible, waterproofed
    via silicon glands. Installation was undertaken by specialist rope technicians
    and geotechnical engineers. Following the successful conclusion of the first pilot,
    the aims of Pilot 2 were firstly, to leverage upon lessons learnt from Pilot 1
    and improve the framework accordingly and, secondly, compare the quality and value
    of data provided by the system to data collected via well-established and proven
    methods employed in Geology. For these reasons, the advice of expert geologists
    of the BGS was sought, and the location of Barton on Sea was selected. At Barton
    on Sea there exists an active landslide that due to its on-going impact on the
    local community (public infrastructure has already been affected and private property
    may be at risk in the future) is actively monitored by local authorities and the
    BGS. This makes the location ideal for trialling and further evaluating the framework.
    A reconnaissance field survey was carried out in July 2019 and deployment positions
    were agreed to place the sensors. As the site is publicly accessible (the base
    of the landslide is part of a public beach), the exact locations must remain undisclosed
    for security reasons. The exact locations must remain undisclosed for security
    reasons, but they are chosen to maximise the likelihood of capturing landslide
    movement, facilitate installation and be at a location monitored regularly by
    the authors and collaborators throughout the project. Download : Download high-res

    (sub-fig. (b). Sand was then saturated with water to confirm signal penetration
    through wet sand at the same depth (sub-fig. (c)). Note that wet sand is one of
    the most harsh media for wireless signal propagation. Finally, verification of
    packet reception on the dashboard of the Sigfox network server (sub-fig (d)).

    devices. 4. The data acquisition tier The main functionality of this tier is to
    collect and transmit sensory data from the area of interest to the data curation
    tier. The tier includes the sensing IoT devices (sensors and IoT boards) as well
    as the IoT network. Regarding the devices, design considerations include the minimum
    required technical specifications of the boards (these are usually considered
    in the context of a trade-off with energy efficiency), means of powering the devices,
    the suite of sensors the devices fitted with and, finally, the physical form factor.
    The choice of wireless communication technology is dictated, on the one hand,
    by the functional requirements of the system (mainly volume and rate of data)
    and on the other hand by availability of and access to relevant infrastructure
    as well as on inferred capital and operational costs. 4.1. Data acquisition in
    Pilot 1 The IoT boards developed for Pilot 1 were based on the BlueFox v2.7 platform,
    provided by Net Sensors Ltd (a Bournemouth-based SME). The initial rationale was
    to use a bespoke hardware platform to maximise energy efficiency. The boards featured
    two low-power microprocessors, a SigFox modem, a 3-axis digital output accelerometer,
    humidity and temperature sensors. The sensing capabilities of the boards were
    extended by means of a DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Thermometer [36] and the Analog
    Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V1.2 by DFRobot [37]. Finally, each device was
    powered by two D-cell batteries at 4200 mAh capacity each, giving a total capacity
    of 8400 mAh (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). The devices were programmed in C using the Arduino
    compiler/IDE. The choice of Sigfox as the LPWAN technology to be used was due
    to its availability in the area. In particular, Bournemouth is one of the focus
    areas in the UK for deploying and promoting the use of IoT technologies under
    the Things Connected3 initiative of Digital Catapult UK, and Sigfox provide a
    100% coverage in the area. Although the use of the Sigfox network requires paying
    a premium per connection, this cost was covered by Digital Catapult. Download

    diagram of the IoT boards for Pilot 2 equipped with GPS-RTK and geophone. The
    wiring permits the geophone to continuously monitor seismic activities and in
    the case of an incident to generate a wake-up signal to the board. This allows
    the board to remain in deep sleep mode for energy efficiency. Since the motes
    were to be deployed in an outdoor environment, exposed to weather conditions and
    other hazards (seagulls and rodents have been proven to pose great threats for
    any type of equipment), particular care was taken to protect the motes. For this
    reason, the boards were waterproofed by the application of an acrylic conformal
    coating and an epoxy resin to protect the circuit boards of the capacitive sensor,
    and they were encased in an IP-67 graded case. Prior to the final deployment,
    extended tests were carried out in order to investigate the penetration rate of
    the Sigfox signal to the ground and to establish the ability of the devices to
    successfully transmit sensory data. The first consideration had to do with the
    morphology of the area of interest and the possibility that the overlooking cliffs
    would cast a “connectivity shadow” over the devices. The second consideration
    had to do with the ability of the devices to wirelessly transmit through wet sand
    (Fig. 10) - it is worth noting that this question is not well studied in the literature.
    The tests were successful, and the devices were deployed by cliff-hanging specialists
    and operated continuously for 6 months while collecting and transmitting data
    at 15-minutes intervals. Download : Download high-res image (145KB) Download :

    1. 4.2. Data acquisition in Pilot 2 Building upon lessons learnt from Pilot 1,
    the design of the sensing IoT devices for Pilot 2 was revisited. For the second
    pilot an off-the-self board was selected (Sparkfun Pro SAMD21 [38], [39]) in order
    to benefit from the wide development support from the manufacturer and the community.
    The sensor suite was also revised after consultation with experts of BGS. The
    new revised suite consisted of the following components: • A 6-Degrees-of-Freedom
    (6DOF) inertial measurement unit (IMU) including an accelerometer, a magnetometer
    and a thermometer (board LSM303C [40]); • A high-fidelity geophone providing seismic
    data in 1D, 2D and 3D seismic surveys (model SM-24 [41]); • An analogue capacitive
    soil moisture sensor (model DFRobot SEN0193 [37]); • An RTK2 (Real Time Kinematics)
    GPS board from ublox [42] for high-precision location data (accuracy 1 cm) for
    monitoring soil movement. The sensors were interfaced with the IoT board using
    the I2C protocol and the QWIIC cable interface. The geophone made use of its own
    breaking board and two operational amplifiers. This configuration enabled the
    IoT board to remain in deep sleep state (thus greatly reducing energy consumption),
    while the geophone was continuously monitored for seismic activity — hardware
    frequency filters made sure the geophone was monitoring only on the desired spectrum
    of seismic activity, thus eliminating any false positives. Should any activity
    be detected, the geophone triggers an interrupt that would wake up the device.
    The wake-up time – consisting in the geophone picking up vibrations at a certain
    frequency spectrum and the break-out board generating an interrupt to the main
    board – is in the order of 30 ms; quick enough to capture any ongoing incidents.
    Details of the wiring of the devices (version with geophone and the RTK-GPS module)
    are depicted in Fig. 13. Regarding the LPWAN technology, the location for Pilot
    2 did not provide Sigfox coverage. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed by Sigfox
    both on the maximum number of transmissions per day (144 messages) and the maximum
    size of each transmission were deemed rather restrictive for the application of
    landslide monitoring; particularly in the case of an incident when sensing and
    data transmission would need to be very dense. Therefore, for Pilot 2, the technology
    of choice has been the LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN also carries several advantages. Firstly,
    one can deploy and manage their own private LPWAN network by procuring the required
    infrastructure (i.e. the wireless access points) privately. This is of great importance
    for the presented framework, as it enables authorities, such as local councils
    or the BGS, to commission their own networks. Furthermore, this greatly reduces
    the operating costs as LoRaWAN, contrary to Sigfox, does not require a subscription.
    Finally, LoRaWAN initiatives, such as The Things Network, support the adoption
    of crowdsourcing practises allowing the general public or third parties to augment
    the network’s coverage by providing roaming services via their own access points.
    Regarding the energy source, each device is equipped with two D-cell Li-Ion 3.3
    V batteries at 4200 mAh each, totalling 8400 mAh. Regarding battery lifetime special
    care has been taken to maximise energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.
    This entailed both hardware interventions (such as dismounting LEDs off the main
    board and using programmable hardware switches to drive sensor components) and
    software optimisations. Fig. 15 depicts the states and the related events of the
    activity cycle of the sensing devices. The states include the device waking-up,
    being active, conducting sensor measurement, transmitting data (comprising both
    transmit and receive modes), and finally the sleep state. Following is an operation
    outline for each state (time interval and drawn current figures were taken by
    means of specialised multi-meter). Download : Download high-res image (73KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 15. State transition diagram capturing the operation
    states of the sensing devices. Active state – This state entails powering up and
    operating the device components that are needed to support basic functionality
    of the device; i.e. the MCU, the LoRa RF module, the operational amplifier (opamp)
    breakout board, etc. At this state, other sensors (such as the accelerometer and
    the soil moisture sensor) are kept on the power-down state by means of hardware
    switches to increase energy efficiency. Measure state – This state entails also
    powering up all sensor components, reading and registering sensor measurements.
    These include the 6-axis digital accelerometer, the soil moisture sensor, the
    opAmp breakout board and the geophone. The geophone itself is a passive unit (i.e.
    it does not draw any current), however, the opamp breakout board that drives it
    consumes a considerable amount of current. To mitigate any spikes in power consumption,
    sensors are sequentially powered up by means of a programmable hardware switch
    and powered down once the sensory readings are registered. Transmission state
    – This state entails the transmission of the registered sensory readings over
    the LPWAN. It consists of both transmit and receive modes for the radio module,
    also accounting for the reception of acknowledgements. The current drawn in this
    state can vary based on payload size, data rate, and selected spreading factor
    (for the LoRaWAN network). The power consumption can be reduced by making the
    right choice of gateway location, payload design and deployment model. In this
    state peripherals and sensors are powered down to further increase energy efficiency.
    Sleep state – In this state the entire device enters an extremely low power consumption
    mode were all components (including the MCU and radio module) are powered down.
    The device remains in this state the grand majority of the time thus achieving
    an extremely low duty cycle. The device exits this state when a corresponding
    interrupt is generated (e.g. when a timer expires). In order to estimate the expected
    battery lifetime of the devices, we have carried out detailed measurements using
    specialised equipment in our electronics lab and an analysis of the power consumption
    of the devices. In particular, by considering the time duration and current consumption
    at each state, we calculated the total charge (measured in mAh) consumed during
    each state per operational cycle. Having configured the devices to collect sensory
    measurements periodically every 3 h, we calculated the estimated number of cycles
    and, therefore, the time each device will operate before depleting its batteries
    to be slightly more than 600 days. Table 2 summarises our analysis. 5. The data
    curation tier Once one of the IoT sensing devices collect some sensory data, this
    data is then transmitted over the LPWAN network to the corresponding network server
    and from there to the data curation tier. This tier of the framework effectively
    amounts to a back-end Big Data storage and processing system leveraging Big Data
    Analytics and Machine learning technologies. Table 2. Summary of measurements

    curation in Pilot 1 Pilot 1 saw the development of a simple back-end system, serving
    as a proof of concept for the landslide monitoring framework and giving space
    to experiment with technologies. Fig. 14 depicts the corresponding reference architecture,
    consisting of a cloud-based server (an AWS m4.large instance running Ubuntu Server
    16.04), hosting a Node-RED instance, an MQTT Server and Broker, and the Elastic
    stack. The network server for both Pilots (Pilot 1 using Sigfox and Pilot 2 LoRaWAN)
    was provided by Things Connected; a Digital Catapult project initiative. Node-RED
    is a flow-based development tool developed by IBM for connecting hardware devices
    and APIs towards the IoT paradigm [12]. It is implemented in JavaScript utilising
    the Node.js framework, establishing a dataflow driven design tool that consists
    of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data generated internally and externally
    from the application. Node-RED was employed to provide a means of establishing
    a modular framework for future extensions and providing the means to export the
    data with ease towards the Elastic Stack. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT) is a lightweight publish and subscribe protocol for IoT and resource-constrained
    devices. MQTT was chosen in similar regards to providing a modular system design,
    by publishing topics, such as landslide data, and subscribing to these so that
    they may be logged and sorted within the Elastic Stack. The MQTT client is featured
    as a part of a Python Script, which specifies which topics to subscribe to, and
    converts the timestamps and JSON packet into a searchable variable within Kibana.
    The Elastic Stack, or ELK stack, is the terminology to define three open source
    projects, namely ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana. ElasticSearch is a distributed,
    RESTFUL search and analytical engine as JSON over HTTP, and excels at indexing
    large amounts of text. Logstash manages events and logs, collecting them and parsing
    them for storage and layer usage with the two complementary technologies. Kibana
    is a data visualisation and exploration tool that acts as a dashboard for the
    stack and allows the creation of graphs and figures to express stored data. Throughout
    the course of the first pilot, this first approach of the data curation tier proved
    to meet the functional requirements of the framework. The system was able to manage
    the ingress flow of IoT data streams. It provided quick search functionality and
    access to stored data and by leveraging upon Kibana, it also supported basic data
    visualisation (more sophisticated functions are provided by the Data Presentation
    tier). 5.2. Data curation Pilot 2 The Data Curation tier for Pilot 2 built upon
    the first iteration, revamping the architecture and adding Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning technologies. This second iteration streamlined and improved
    the architecture put in place in the Pilot1, offering a more mature, modern and
    effective Data Curation tier. Much like Pilot 1, the backend system is hosted
    on a cloud server (an AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance). The core technologies
    used in the first iteration were maintained (Things Connected network server,
    Node-RED and Elastic Stack). The data processing and analysis components that
    were introduced include Kafka and a Python-based analytics system. The software
    architecture is depicted on Fig. 17. Raw sensory data arrive in the system via
    an HTTP interface from the ‘The Things Network’ server. Node-RED captures and
    processes the data payload, parsing it into data segments and performing an initial
    pre-processing before being fed to Kafka. Kafka is a real-time data processing
    and messaging platform used to send data to machine learning models periodically.
    From Kafka, data are consumed by two processes: Elasticsearch and a Python script.
    Elasticsearch indexes the data, and the Python script begins the data analysis
    process. Python-based machine learning models are used on time-series data to
    accomplish predictive tasks. Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit learn and
    TensorFlow are used here. From the Python Script, data is used to train a set
    of prediction models in real-time. The results of the model are sequentially published
    back into Kafka, another Elasticsearch instance consumes them. Kafka is integrated
    into the system using the Confluent Platform. This is a complete streaming data
    platform, providing a full production-ready solution for real-time data streams,
    with Kafka at its core. This platform was chosen for its use of Kafka, easy integration
    and high-performance clients for Kafka API [43]. Elasticsearch acts as the primary
    data storage for the backend. Multiple indexes are defined to hold different information
    such as sensor data, model results and logs. Kibana is used to manage the Elasticsearch
    cluster and visualise sensor and model data. (See Fig. 16.) Download : Download

    of the Data Curation for Pilot 2. 6. The data presentation tier An aspect that
    is commonly overlooked in the design and development of data-driven IoT systems
    is that of data presentation. Indeed, for systems whose primary function is the
    collection and use of data (such as monitoring systems) their true added value
    resides in the final end-users of the system being able to efficiently and conveniently
    consume collected data and information. How this will be achieved is a complex
    and multifaceted challenge that strongly depends on the nature of the application
    and the type of data, as well as on the stakeholders and end-users of the system.
    In the case of landslide monitoring the aim has been to develop a presentation
    layer that would be agile enough to accommodate the needs of both high-expertise
    users (e.g. geologists and geotechnical engineers) and local community stakeholders
    (e.g. local governments and planning authorities). The data presentation tier
    utilises a front-end system that integrates with the back-end infrastructure to
    display collected and curated data to the end-user in a meaningful and impactful
    way. In particular, in the presented framework, it took the form of a Web Application
    created using the Django web framework and written in Python. The UI elements
    of the system were created using the help of Frameworks such as Bootstrap, enabling
    rapid development of a UI. Django is a widespread high-level python framework
    that uses a Model View Controller (MVC) design. It encourages rapid development
    by taking care of the hassle in web development. It handles the ‘public’ features
    allowing a developer to purely focus on business logic. Further, Django has been
    designed to maximise speed of development, application security and scalability
    [44]. Data displayed and used on the front-end environment are data made available
    by the back-end system and data analytics pipeline. The web application links
    directly to the Elasticsearch instance present in the data curation tier. This
    is accomplished with the use of the Python library Elasticsearch_DSL. This is
    used to create Django style Get Method models that retrieve sensor data stored
    on the backend Elastic Stack just like any other Django Model to database interaction.
    Elasticsearch_DSL provides a more convenient and friendly way to write queries
    to Elasticsearch, it keeps close to the format of Elasticsearch querying, keeping
    its terminology and structure, whilst allowing its expression in the Python language.

    a full arsenal of data viewing and manipulation methods such as; Interactive Maps
    integration, enabled by the Python Library Leaflet JS; Custom graphing, using
    JS graphs; Kibana integration; Device specifications and statistics; and a notification
    system, with fully customisable user-defined thresholds. All data handled by the
    front-end system is real-time, allowing the web application to express a constant
    and continuous up-to-date state of landslide sites, thus allowing trends to be
    observed as they appear. (See Fig. 18.) Download : Download high-res image (250KB)

    The maps integration allows the depiction of device nodes onto an accurate World
    map, allowing the presentation of physical device locations, in relevance to each
    other. This is coupled with the interactive ability to manipulate the maps scale
    and viewable region and functionality to select specific nodes present on the
    map. This also opens a page specific to that device, where specifications and
    statistics on the device can be seen, as well as custom and generic graphs explicitly
    relating to that device’s data. Custom graphing is achieved by JavaScript code,
    and allows for the generation of graphs with selectable data sources and is the
    primary way the application displays data to an end-user. Elasticsearch_DSL queries
    populate the graphs with data stored on the Elasticsearch instance, this is updated
    in real time, providing the user with a constant, up-to-date stream of data. In
    order to not lose functionality provided by the backend implementation, the web
    application is linked with a Kibana dashboard created as a product of the back-end
    Elastic Stack. This snapshot is shown to the user and allows them to keep functionality
    and visualisations created on Kibana, whilst hiding developer functions. Additionally,
    using Elasticsearch_DSL search queries, device specifications and statistics are
    printed to the user. The above features provide an end-user with a plethora of
    manipulation and viewing methods, providing versatility and diversity in the application’s
    use. Notification and warnings are also included; these send site-wide warnings
    when user-defined threshold levels have been met or exceeded for selected variables.
    The functionalities supported by the data presentation tier are the result of
    a designing stage that included eliciting requirements and needs from stakeholders.
    Its four main sections are: Dashboard; Devices; Node; and Settings. It is worth
    noting that the sections have feature and functionality overlaps, but present
    their functionality in differing ways; for example, Dashboard shows high-level
    information, whereas Devices offers specific in-depth information. 6.1. The “Dashboard”
    section This section serves as the main ‘Hub’ of the tier. It includes the interactive
    map that shows the location of all sensors, and these sensors themselves can be
    interacted with to take the user to a device’s specific page. Additionally, using
    the applications notification functionality, if a node on the map has an alert
    (e.g. because soil activity was detected), then the node changes colour to red,
    visually notifying the user of an error or alert with that device. (See Fig. 19.)
    Below this feature, further content is split into three tabs. The first tab shows
    all sensor data in graphs, per sensing device. The next tab contains all the notifications
    of the system, and these notifications are alerts that have been created due to
    incoming values exceeding set thresholds. The final tab includes a custom graph
    that allows the users to customise what data is shown and from what node. Download

    this is a list of device specific details as well as a list of the latest figures
    are shown to end-users. Below this, there is a 3-tab content system: the first
    tab displays readings from the device in graph format; the second tab includes
    notifications specific to that device, and the final tab includes a custom graph
    that allows the user to manipulate what data is shown. (See Fig. 20.) Download

    Data visualisation ‘Nodes’ page. 6.3. The “Settings” section This section includes
    settings that allow the user to adjust the alert threshold levels based on sensor
    readings. It also serves as a space to add any additional settings as required.
    For instance, a user could set up an alert to be generated when there is a change
    in the orientation of a sensing device (as this is indicated by the accelerometer
    readings) or when seismic activity is captured by one of the geophones. 6.4. The
    “Nodes” section This section shows all the devices currently deployed in a table
    list format with a focus on the current status of the devices. This view omits
    recorded environmental data, and only shows technical device information, such
    as residual energy levels, quality of wireless connection, and so on. 7. Conclusions
    & future work This work introduced a technological framework for data-driven IoT
    systems focusing on the application area of landslide monitoring. The three tiers
    of the framework – namely the data acquisition, data curation and data presentation
    tiers – were presented in detail and the corresponding considerations and design
    choices were elaborated. The framework was employed to develop two IoT systems
    in the context of two pilots for landslide monitoring. The two sites of deployment
    have landslides of different scales and characteristics and have, therefore, enabled
    to fine tune and validate the framework in real-life operating conditions. In
    particular, the use of state of the art IoT technologies has enabled the development
    of highly scalable and cost efficient systems that provide dense data both in
    space and time. The two pilots have also been key in demonstrating the added value
    of data-driven IoT systems in inter-disciplinary research as they nicely complement
    already existing methods. This work focused on the methodological approach (as
    captured by the presented framework) of developing data-driven IoT systems and
    the technologies employed to develop them. The plan for future work is to allow
    Pilot 2, at Barton on Sea, to run for two years – such that two full seasons are
    captured – so as to (a) validate and if needed, inform the design of the framework;
    and (b) to collect data such that a dataset of IoT geological data is compiled.
    This dataset (which will be made available to the community) will be used to train
    corresponding Machine Learning models, whose accuracy on forecasting and identifying
    landslide incidents will be evaluated against currently employed methods. Also,
    bespoke Visual Analytics will be developed addressing the needs of different stakeholders
    (scientific community, local authorities, general public). A final strand of our
    research will be on developing further the framework (in particular the design
    of the devices) such that their potential environmental impact is reduced or even
    eliminated. CRediT authorship contribution statement Sivanarayani M. Karunarathne:

    \ one of the huge challenges in Internet of Tings (IoT) with billions of heterogeneous\
    \ devices already connected\nand many more to come in the future. Improving data\
    \ transfer eﬃciency, scalability, and survivability in the fragile network\nenvironment\
    \ and constrained resources in IoT systems is always a fundamental issues. In\
    \ this paper, we present a novel message\nrouting algorithm that optimizes IoT\
    \ data transfers in a resource constrained and fragile network environment in\
    \ publish-\nsubscribe model. Te proposed algorithm can adapt the dynamical network\
    \ topology of continuously changing IoT devices with\nthe rerouting method. We\
    \ also present a rerouting algorithm in Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)\
    \ to take over the\ntopic-based session ﬂows with a controller when a broker crashed\
    \ down. Data can still be communicated by another broker with\nrerouting mechanism.\
    \ Higher availability in IoT can be achieved with our proposed model. Trough demonstrated\
    \ eﬃciency of\nour algorithms about message routing and dynamically adapting the\
    \ continually changing device and network topology, IoT\nsystems can gain scalability\
    \ and survivability. We have evaluated our algorithms with open source Eclipse\
    \ Mosquitto. With the\nextensive experiments and simulations performed in Mosquitto,\
    \ the results show that our algorithms perform optimally. Te\nproposed algorithms\
    \ can be widely used in IoT systems with publish-subscribe model. Furthermore,\
    \ the algorithms can also be\nadopted in other protocols such as Constrained Application\
    \ Protocol (CoAP).\n1. Introduction\nTe Internet of Tings (IoT) has emerged as\
    \ the next\nevolution of the technology which covers a wide variety of\ndevices\
    \ and system platforms, such as embedded systems,\nnetworked sensors, actuators,\
    \ and smart home devices.\nInevitably, the resource starved nature in most IoT\
    \ devices\nmakes it error-prone to eﬃciently manage and maintain a\nreliable IoT\
    \ system, not to mention the security issues as-\nsociated with some scarcely\
    \ attended IoT devices [1, 2]. One\nof the biggest challenges in IoT is the management\
    \ and\nmonitoring of an IoTsystem, especially when heterogeneous\ndevices are\
    \ networked in geographically distributed envi-\nronments. And IoT devices are\
    \ often used to monitor in-\ndustrial\nproduction,\nenergy\nconsumption,\nagriculture\n\
    condition, and business operation, even in sensitive medical\napplication.\nTerefore,\n\
    the\ncross-platform\nand\ncross-\napplication data ﬂows among IoT devices are\
    \ often ex-\ntremely important. Te protocols that allow machine-to-\nmachine,\
    \ device-to-device, and device-to-server commu-\nnication to communicate with\
    \ each other become very\nimportant in IoT system. In general, wireless network\n\
    protocols have evolved in the form of WiFi, ZigBee, Blue-\ntooth, and routing\
    \ protocols from multihop to ad hoc and\nmobile ad hoc networks (MANET); the data\
    \ protocols play\nan important role in IoT protocol stack, which includes\nMessage\
    \ Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [3], Con-\nstrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP) [4], AMQP [5], and\nWebSocket [6]. Comparatively MQTT seems to be more\n\
    promising as seen in Figure 1 showing the trends com-\nparison of MQTT, COMP,\
    \ and AMQP, according to Google\ntrends dataset [7]. Tis paper includes the communication\n\
    eﬃciency of MQTT. All the information in the MQTT is\norganized with Tree structure\
    \ and topics-based naming [8].\nHindawi\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n\
    Volume 2020, Article ID 8884924, 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8884924\n\
    Te history of MQTT dates back to 1999, which was\ninvented by IBM. MQTT uses the\
    \ so-called “publish/sub-\nscription” model to transmit data among the IoT things.\n\
    MQTT is more mature and stable than CoAP and AMQP.\nDue to the low-cost and power-constrained\
    \ nature of most\nIoT devices, the communication eﬃciency is extremely\nimportant.\
    \ For example, if we can improve the power ef-\nﬁciency, the IoTdevice can be\
    \ operated for even longer time\nperiod than low power eﬃciency without having\
    \ to replace\nbatteries. Tis is one of the fundamental motivations for our\nfocus\
    \ on IoT data communication protocol eﬃciency in this\npaper. An IoTsystem consists\
    \ of a large number of internet-\nconnected resource-constrained and dynamic nature\
    \ devices\n[9]. Terefore achieving data transmission eﬃciency is very\nimportant\
    \ in this type of distributed networks. Data\ntransmission in many IoT systems\
    \ use publish-subscribe\nmodel, as in MQTT. In AMQP protocol, clients send\nmessages\
    \ to the AMQP server with topics, and server listens\nfor messages with those\
    \ topics and routes the messages to the\napplications subscribed to the AMQP server\
    \ [5, 10]. MQTT\nuses a similar approach where message brokers use topics to\n\
    route messages from publishing clients to subscribing clients\n[11]. To exchange\
    \ data between devices with publish-sub-\nscribe model, matching, ﬁltering, and\
    \ routing of messages\nbased on topics, as the bridge of publisher and subscriber,\n\
    have extreme importance in IoT system. Especially when\nthere are plenty of messages\
    \ produced by a large number of\nIoT devices, improving the eﬃciency and eﬀect\
    \ of topic\nmatching, ﬁltering, and routing is vital. Te work in this\npaper aims\
    \ to address this important need of data com-\nmunication in IoT system. To address\
    \ this important need,\nwe propose two algorithms to improve data exchange eﬃ-\n\
    ciency in IoT system. Te two important contributions of\nthis paper are as follows:\n\
    (i) Development of a topic routing algorithm to com-\nmunicate data between IoT\
    \ devices\n(ii) Development, implementation, and evaluation of a\nBroker Network\
    \ to improve the survivability and\nrobustness of connected-device data exchange\
    \ in IoT\nWe evaluate our algorithms with MQTT protocol\nimplementation Mosquitto\
    \ [3, 12]. We have performed\nextensive experiments and results show that with\
    \ our al-\ngorithms we can dramatically improve data exchange eﬃ-\nciency while\
    \ signiﬁcantly reducing transmission time. Te\norganization of the paper is as\
    \ follows. In Section 2, we\npresent background and motivation of this work high-\n\
    lighting main concerns that arise in the data communication\nin IoTand state of\
    \ the art in the ﬁeld. Section 3 presents our\nalgorithms in detail. Te implementation\
    \ and evaluation of\nour algorithms are presented in Section 4. Finally, conclu-\n\
    sions are drawn in Section 5.\n2. Background\n2.1. Need of the Data Exchange Eﬃciency\
    \ Problem in IoT.\nDevices in IoT system often have limited processing capa-\n\
    bilities, low bandwidth, and small memory capacities and are\npowered by batteries\
    \ with limited working hours. Terefore,\nimproving the usage eﬃciency of the network\
    \ and reducing\npower usage in IoT scenarios are extremely important. As a\npromising\
    \ data communication protocol in IoT, MQTT is a\nmachine-to-machine (M2M), lightweight\
    \ publish-subscribe\nmessaging transport protocol. In publish-subscribe model,\n\
    subscriber registers its interest topics to a broker and\npublisher sends data\
    \ to a broker [13–15]. Publish clients and\nsubscribe clients exchange data through\
    \ a broker with topic\nmatching. When there are huge message ﬂows exchanged by\n\
    broker, issue of latency may be inevitable [16]. Te latency\nnot only decreases\
    \ the speed of data transmission but also\nwastes device battery to decrease the\
    \ overall device life-span\n[17–20]. In this paper, we focus on data exchange\
    \ eﬃciency\nin an environment where there is a limited Internet access or\nthere\
    \ are serious network jitter problems for several hundred\nmiles around. Te emphasis\
    \ is transferring data based on\nsubject-based route to a data center. Essentially,\
    \ it is about a\nnew gateway and topic-based routing. First, we need to\nclassify\
    \ necessity of transferring data between gateways.\nMQTT in IoT is used in data\
    \ exchange which is diﬀerent\nfrom corresponding sensor network about data integration.\n\

    Trends OF MQTT, COAP, AMQP\nMQTT\nAMQP\nCOAP\nFigure 1: Trends comparison of MQTT,\
    \ CoAP, and AMQP.\n2\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nWe depict an agriculture\
    \ processing scenario to clarify the\nnecessity for data transmission with topic-based\
    \ routing.\nConsumers today often put signiﬁcant value on fresh, high\nquality\
    \ food. Farmers need to get information from ﬁelds,\ntake actions to crop depending\
    \ on weather conditions, and\nshow the information about the produce to the end\
    \ con-\nsumers with public access interface. Tis information in-\ncludes identifying\
    \ the drought and weather conditions,\nperiodic measurements of monitoring data\
    \ with gateway,\ndepending on intensity of drought decide about irrigation\nand\
    \ watering, monitoring pest disasters, and then taking\nactions about the spraying\
    \ pesticides with drone, without\ndistinguishing nodes from the broker’s point\
    \ of view, which\nbrings diﬃculty due to large number of devices. If there are\n\
    plenty of things in one IoTsystem, it is necessary to identify\nnodes having the\
    \ corresponding information and to identify\nthese nodes dramatically and eﬃciently.\n\
    If this information is conﬁgured manually, while not the\nautomatically, it is\
    \ a huge challenge to manage thousands of\nnodes. When the network structure is\
    \ changed, the con-\nﬁgurations need to be done. Terefore, automatic discov-\n\
    ering and conﬁguring the IoT network are a huge challenge.\nAnd agriculture processing\
    \ system scenario has the fol-\nlowing features: data from farm in ﬁelds to table\
    \ on Internet,\nﬁeld data spanning up to one year, wide geographical areas\nof\
    \ crops, and fragile network conditions.\nAs noted earlier, MQTT used in IoT system\
    \ emphasizes\ndata exchange, not mainly for data integration. Te question\narises,\
    \ why in the agriculture process system we need data\nexchange? Tere are several\
    \ reasons to make it necessary for\ndata exchange in agriculture processing system\
    \ and data\nexchange about storm, hurricanes, cyclones bad weather. It is\nknown\
    \ to all that storm may inﬂuence several hundreds of\nmiles. It is very important\
    \ to spread related information about\nagriculture. In fact, weather conditions\
    \ have a heavy inﬂuence\non the crop management. Data exchanges among diﬀerent\n\
    farms are very important. For example, in Pennsylvania, there\nmay have been dozens\
    \ of farms located in a region where pests\nand diseases spread very quickly.\
    \ Similarly, farms in remote\nand regional areas in Australia are spread over\
    \ on thousands\nof acres. If the information around one regain can exchange\n\
    on time, precautions can be taken to prevent or reduce loss\nfrom any natural\
    \ disaster which may otherwise aﬀect dras-\ntically the agriculture processing\
    \ system.\n2.2. Essence of the Problem Studied in Tis Paper. Te IoT\nthings are\
    \ spread around hundreds of miles in ﬁeld or plain.\nAccording to the mechanism\
    \ of MQTT protocol, data ex-\nchanges among diﬀerent nodes and brokers should\
    \ be\nconﬁgured according to the IP addresses and topic names.\nOnly after manual\
    \ conﬁguration or by conﬁguration ﬁles,\nthe data can be exchanged along speciﬁc\
    \ path to another\nnode, which gets damaged crushes down, we will not know\nuntil\
    \ proactive testing is performed. Neighboring nodes\nmight have information about\
    \ the damaged nodes but the\nimportant question here is how to dynamically ﬁgure\
    \ out\nwhich nodes have the corresponding data and how to arrive\nat that node\
    \ with the shortest path automatically. In our\nproposed algorithms, we have focused\
    \ on this problem. On\nthe contrary, if the reconﬁguration is done manually or\n\
    through CLI scripts, data exchange with MQTT in IoT is not\nreliable and is not\
    \ easy to recover. Maintenance and\nmanagement of data exchange in this model\
    \ is a hard task\nwhich can be costly. Terefore, a reliable, automatic data\n\
    discovery and data exchange model with a shortest path in a\nfragile, dynamic\
    \ network environment is very important.\nWith our algorithms, we can ﬁnd the\
    \ speciﬁc nodes for\nspeciﬁc data with one topic and get the shortest path to\
    \ that\nnodes dynamically and automatically. We need a smarter\nrecovery program,\
    \ which can save money (automatically) to\navoid remote login and can perform\
    \ recovery eﬃciently.\nGenerally speaking, through the broadcast method and the\n\
    way of active subscription, we can achieve data exchange\nautomation. Te existing\
    \ practices often involve manual\nconﬁguration where messages are read or processed\
    \ man-\nually. In our proposed model, we aim for automatic data\nexchange.\n3.\
    \ Broker Network\nData collection is one of the key functions in IoT system.\n\
    However, battery powered devices in IoT often work in low\nbandwidth and fragile\
    \ network environments. One of the\nmajor challenges is to provide eﬃcient, stable,\
    \ and scalable\nservices in IoT. For example, to extend a device’s eﬀective\n\
    working life-span as much as possible, eﬃciency should be\nconsidered to save\
    \ power. At the same time, to ensure the\navailability and scalability of data\
    \ communication services,\nbroker network is a natural choice in IoTsystem [21,\
    \ 22]. Te\nbroker network can provide stable connections among the\ndevices to\
    \ handle the data traﬃcs in IoT. In this section, we\ndescribe our proposed novel\
    \ topic-based data transmission\nalgorithm to eﬃciently exchange data in IoT system.\n\
    3.1. Topic-Based Data Routing in MQTT. When servers in\nthe cloud system gather\
    \ data from things as messages in IoT\nsystem, we will route the messages ﬂow\
    \ through broker\nnetwork in IoT to cloud. For example, client 1 subscribes to\n\
    broker 1 with topic “top” and client 2 publishes to broker 2\nwith topic “top.”\
    \ Broker 2 should route the message pub-\nlished by client 2 to broker 1, so that\
    \ client 1 can get the\ncorresponding data. Tis is the so-called topic-based mes-\n\
    sage routing problem in IoT. Te key point here is the ef-\nﬁciency when broker\
    \ nodes synchronize data among\nbrokers, which include the following:\n(i) Forwarding\
    \ all messages to the other bridges\n(ii) Routing of messages to the brokers\n\
    For the CPU, bandwidth, and memory constrained\ndevices, the routing decision\
    \ algorithm should be simple\nenough to save resource. Normally, we can divide\
    \ the nodes\ninto two types: one is routing node and the other is terminal\nsubscriber\
    \ node or publisher node. Our data routing deci-\nsion algorithm is depicted in\
    \ Algorithm 1 called TBRouting.\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n3\nIn summary,\
    \ there are three scenarios:\n(i) One to one directly\n(ii) One to many directly\n\
    (iii) One to remote nodes through routers\nIn one to remote nodes through routers\
    \ scenario, the\ncloud servers gather data from devices as messages transmit\n\
    through the local IoT network. We address the issue of\ncollecting speciﬁc data\
    \ and how to transfer it eﬃciently in\nour algorithm through ﬁnding the shortest\
    \ path based on\ntopics for message delivery to cloud or server. Tat is to say,\
    \ a\nrouting protocol is considered. Our message routing deci-\nsion algorithm\
    \ is depicted in Figure 2.\nIn Figure 2, we depict message routing scenario. Tere\n\
    are 7 routers, router ①∼router ⑦ connected with each\nother wirelessly and to\
    \ the Internet or cloud shown in\nFigure 2. ① is connected to Internet or cloud,\
    \ and ⑥ is\nconnected to sensor network. When messages are sent to\nrouter ⑥ through\
    \ sensor network, the message will be\nrouted from router ⑥ to router ①. Because\
    \ the messaging\nrouter here is not the typical router in a typical network,\n\
    therefore, we deﬁne the message routing algorithm below\nand routing table in\
    \ the following sections. For the fragile\nnetwork and constrained hardware devices,\
    \ the topology\nmay be changed constantly [23]. Terefore, the path and\nrouter\
    \ table may change with the topology. Just as the\nscenario shown in Figure 2,\
    \ the routing algorithm is in-\ntroduced in the following steps:\n(1) Figuring\
    \ out the shortest path between router ⑥ and\nrouter ①, it is a single-source\
    \ shortest path topic-\nbased problem in graph theory. We can address it, for\n\
    example, with Dijkstra’s algorithm. Here, the shortest\npath is router serial\
    \ ⑥ ⟹ ④ ⟹ ② ⟹ ①.\n(2) In reverse sequence, router ① subscribes topics from\nrouter\
    \ ②, router ② subscribes topics from router ④,\nand router ④ subscribe topics\
    \ from router ⑥.\n(3) When sensors publish topics to router ⑥, the\nmessages will\
    \ be pushed back to hop by hop until\nrouter ①.\nWhen the topology structure of\
    \ router network changes,\nwe can ﬁgure out the new shortest path from the source\
    \ to\nthe end as described in Step (1) dynamically. Te “routing\ntables” are critical\
    \ to the system because IoT network may\nnot be using the traditional TCP/IP protocol\
    \ stack which\nmakes real-time data transmission with the shortest path\nwithout\
    \ considering the network protocol even more\nchallenging. Tat is to say, regardless\
    \ of TCP/IP or Zigbee,\nthe IoTsystem can still ﬁnd the data source and the shortest\n\
    path transparently based on topics. In the next section, we\nwill describe this\
    \ algorithm in detail.\n3.2. Topic-Based Data Routing Protocol. In order to facilitate\n\
    problem description, ﬁrst we provide some relevant deﬁ-\nnitions. Ten algorithm\
    \ is depicted in detail with an ex-\nample. We present eﬃciency evaluation of\
    \ our algorithm in\nSection 4.\n3.2.1. Deﬁnitions\nDeﬁnition 1. Routing table\
    \ structure: in order to make\nnodes ﬁnd each other and in the shortest path,\
    \ some in-\nformation should be stored in every nodes. Table 1 provides\nthe structure\
    \ of the routing table.\nDeﬁnition 2. Subscribing node: node 1 subscribes to node\
    \ 2;\nnode 1 is the so-called subscribing node.\nDeﬁnition 3. Subscribing node\
    \ queue: A subscribes to B, B\nsubscribes to C, C subscribes to D, and “ABC” is\
    \ the so-\ncalled subscribing node queue.\nDeﬁnition 4. Weight (T): the number\
    \ of node in a string.\nDeﬁnition 5. Host_Topic (T): the ultimate data consumer\n\
    and\ncorresponding\ntopic.\nFor\nexample,\n“Host_Topic\n(ABCD/TOP)” \x88 “D/TOP”.\n\
    Deﬁnition 6. Searched_Set: a node set, in which every node\nhas ﬁnished building\
    \ the routing table.\nDeﬁnition 7. NotSearched_Set: a node set, in which every\n\
    node has not ﬁnished building the routing table.\nDeﬁnition 8. Adjacent (X): a\
    \ set of adjacency of node X.\nDeﬁnition 9. Match (top): determining whether the\
    \ node\ncan provide the corresponding topic data.\n3.2.2. Routing Algorithm. Te\
    \ algorithm essentially com-\npletes the following tasks. First, the algorithm\
    \ determines the\nnode where the topic and corresponding data reside. Second,\n\
    the algorithm dynamically ﬁnds the shortest path. Ten the\ndata can be transported\
    \ to Internet. Tat is to say, the al-\ngorithm solves that which node has the\
    \ topic and data and\nhow the data can be transported to the ultimate user. We\n\
    solve this problem with our new routing algorithm named\nTopic-Based Routing Algorithm\
    \ (TBRG). Te rerouting\nalgorithm is given as follows. In the algorithm, “R” is\
    \ the\nultimate data consumer in Algorithm 2.\nNext, we elaborate our algorithm\
    \ through a concrete\nexample illustrated in Figure 3, which shows an example\
    \ of\nnodes structure of IoT system. We assume Ⓐ is a node in\ndata center, data\
    \ ultimate consumer, and Ⓘ is the data\nsource connecting the sensor.\n① Initialization\
    \ of node Ⓐ in Table 2.\n② A subscribing to nodes Ⓑ, Ⓓ, and Ⓔ, that is,\nⒶ ⇒ Ⓑ,\
    \ Ⓐ ⇒ Ⓓ, Ⓐ ⇒ Ⓔ, as shown in Tables 3–5.\n③ Next, B and E subscribing to node Ⓒ\
    \ and node Ⓕ,\nrespectively, that is, node Ⓑ ⇒ node Ⓒ and node\nⒺ ⇒ node Ⓕ in\
    \ Tables 6 and 7.\n④ Next, node Ⓒ and node Ⓕ subscribing to nodes Ⓘ\nand Ⓖ, respectively,\
    \ that is, node Ⓒ ⇒ node Ⓘ and\nnode Ⓕ ⇒ node Ⓖ as shown in Table 8, VX.\n4\n\
    Security and Communication Networks\n⑤ Node Ⓖ subscribing to Node I, that is,\
    \ node\nⒼ ⇒ node I′. In the algorithm, this step is less likely to\nhappen because\
    \ of the value of weight (CBA/top) in\nStep ④; the routing information is “CBA/top”,\
    \ as\nshown in Tables 9 and 10.\nFigure 4 shows a bipartite graph. Set (1) is\
    \ a topic set\nx1∼xn corresponding to published data. Set (2) is a topic set\n\
    y1∼yn corresponding to subscribed data. Te next algorithm\nis to match topics\
    \ from one node in set (1) to another node in\nset (2) step by step according\
    \ to the shortest path in reverse\norder. In addition, when we upgrade system\
    \ or update the\nstatus about things in ﬁeld, that is to say, delivering the\n\
    instruction set from cloud to IoT devices, the instruction\ndataset is routed\
    \ reversely with a series of publish and then\nsubscribing among routers.\n3.3.\
    \ Rerouting Algorithm in MQTT. Each broker may serve\nfor thousands of clients’\
    \ connections. In case one broker\ncrashes down, clients should have the ability\
    \ to connect to\nanother broker and work continually and smoothly, which is\n\
    called the rerouting problem. To address this problem, we\npropose a rerouting\
    \ algorithm to take over the topic-based\nsession ﬂows with a controller when\
    \ a broker crashes down.\nAlthough it is almost impossible to communicate when\
    \ broker\ncrashes down, data can still be communicated by another\n(1) procedure\
    \ TBRouting.\n(2)\nWhen a broker receives data with topics from one client, the\
    \ broker matches topics in its topic tree.\n(3)\nIf the node is just the terminal\
    \ subscriber, then broker forwards it to that node, and then go to 5. If the node\
    \ is not the terminal\nconsumer of the topic, go to 4.\n(4)\nIf the node is not\
    \ the terminal consumer of the topic, the data will be forwarded to the other\
    \ broker nodes, which is the next hop\nof the routing.\n(5)\nContinuing with 3,\
    \ with next hop, data eventually will be sent to cloud or terminal nodes. Te messages\
    \ are sent with the shortest\npath to the ﬁnal destination.\n(6)\nTe topic may\
    \ be sent to many diﬀerent receivers who subscribe the topics. All the receivers\
    \ will receive the same messages.\n(7)\nTe broker will decide whether to store\
    \ the topic or not.\nALGORITHM 1: TBRouting.\nD\nB\nE\nA\nC\nF\nG\nI\nFigure 3:\

    \ to facilitate the node replacing problem\nstatement.\nDeﬁnition 10. Topic_Session:\
    \ when node X publishes a topic\n“t” to a broker named “Brk,” and node Y subscribes\
    \ the same\ntopic “t” to the same broker “Brk” just illustrated in\nFigure 6(a)\
    \ shown; we call this binary relation Topic Session\nwith notation XTSR(t, brk)Y.\
    \ If node Y only can get topic\n“t” from node X, we use notation X!TSR(t, brk)Y\
    \ to express\nthis relation. We depict the relation with Structural Oper-\national\

    Pub(t)Brk,\nNormally, we can use process expression to depict\ncommunication behavior.\

    \ Behavior Equiv-\nalence relation A∽B, as Figure 7 showed. In this section, we\n\
    will focus on how to ﬁnd an appropriate broker to take over\nthe topic session\

    \ and Communication Networks\n7\nmay connect to this node. In this model, for\
    \ example, in\nFigure 6(b), node X and node Y may ﬁnd the other nodes.\nTe IoT\
    \ network node is diﬀerent from the normal\nwireless network node as follows.\n\
    (i) Node Y gets the topic “t” from node X through\nbroker A with subscription\
    \ behavior. However,\nwhen broker A crashes down, nodes X and Y must\ncommunicate\
    \ with another broker with the same\nbehavior. Or else node Y cannot get the topic\
    \ “t”\nfrom node X. Te situation may be worse when\nnodes X and Y have the relation\
    \ X!(t, brk)Y.\n(ii) In MQTT, one broker is speciﬁed when nodes\npublish or subscribe\
    \ to a broker. Tat is to say, the\nsubscriber\nor\npublisher\ncannot\nautomatically\n\
    reconﬁgure the broker. For example, MQTT pro-\ntocol with QoS 0 and the node even\
    \ are not aware\nwhen the broker crashes down.\nTe problem here is that nodes\
    \ and brokers have an\nequal status. So nodes almost know nothing about each\n\
    other. Because of mutual independence to each other, one\nnode cannot change another\
    \ node’s behavior.\nTo sum up, when node X and node Y have the relation\nX!(t,\
    \ brk)Y, nodes X and Y must synchronize migration to\nother nodes. Publisher may\
    \ continue to publish data to\nbroker A even when A has crashed down with QoS\
    \ 0.\nTerefore, we must clarify the substitution conditions that\nhow a broker\
    \ can be replaced by another broker partly or\ntotally. Tis raises the following\
    \ questions:\n(i) What conditions should be met when a broker\nsubstitutes one\
    \ or a few brokers to take over that\nbroker?\n(ii) Who will we ﬁnd a crashed\
    \ down broker?\n(iii) How can we take measures on the nodes or brokers\nto take\
    \ over that broker?\n(iv) Where should we store the relation X TSR(t, brk)Y\n\
    set in that crash down broker? So we can keep topic\nrelated\nsessions\nto\ncontinue\n\
    the\ndata\ncommunication.\n3.3.3. Broker Substitution Conditions. According to\
    \ process\nbehavior equivalence, if brokers A and B have a weak be-\nhavior equivalence\
    \ relation A ≈ B, then nodes X and Y have\nthe approximate communication ability\
    \ with A and B as\nshown in Figure 8.\nTe process expression of broker A is PA,\
    \ which is\ndeﬁned by the following syntax:\nPA: \x88 \U0010FF50i∈I \U0010FF51\
    \ ·A|! \U0010FF51 ·A,\n\U0010FF51 : \x88 Pub(ti);\nSub〈ti〉;\nTe notation ! \U0010FF51\
    \ ·A is loop execution behavior. And ti is\na topic ∈ Topic_Set, which is a topic\
    \ set to be published or\nsubscribed. \U0010FF51 is an action preﬁx. Ten the broker\
    \ substi-\ntution conditions are\nPub < ti > · X| Pub ti\n\0\U0010FF01 · A| Sub\

    \ Equivalence ∽ is a binary\nhomomorphism relation. And Weak Behavior Equivalence\n\
    ≈ is roughly approximate relation. If brokers A and B meet\nfollowing conditions,\n\
    A∽B or A ≈ B, XTSR(t, A), Y, t ∈ Topic Set, topic\nsessions on A can be transferred\
    \ to broker B.\n3.3.4. Pub/Sub Flow Controller and Measures. As noted in\nthe\
    \ previous section, publishers are not aware if a broker\ncrashes down. Even the\
    \ publisher knows the absence of broker,\nthe topic-based session cannot go on\
    \ without outside help, not\nto mention ﬁnding one or a few brokers to take over\
    \ the\nshutdown broker. Terefore, the extra controller is necessary to\nensure\
    \ the survivability of IoTsystem, just as Software Deﬁned\nNetworks (SDN) do [24].\
    \ As shown in Figure 9, there is a\ncontroller over brokers to schedule the whole\
    \ IoTnetwork. Te\nmain purposes of the controller are as follows:\n(i) Reviving\
    \ of dead broker through heart beating\n(ii) Figuring out the substitute node\n\
    (iii) Transferring the topic-based session ﬂow from crash\ndown broker to alternative\
    \ broker\nNew node\nFigure 7: Wireless network broadcast.\n8\nSecurity and Communication\
    \ Networks\nBut the controller will never be used as data commu-\nnication. Its\
    \ main usage is to manage the nodes in IoT\nnetwork.\nTrough heart beating, for\
    \ example, subscribing “hello\nworld” to managed node on a regular timer with\
    \ Quality of\nService (QoS), it is easy to get the information in broker node\n\
    in order to determine a substitute node. To ﬁgure out\nsubstitute node, the controller\
    \ should collect the following\ninformation in regular time. For example, as shown\
    \ in\nTable 11, in regular intervals.\nIn Table 11, if the action is subscribe\
    \ then 1, else then 0.\nAnd if the broker is just performing normal then 1, else\
    \ then 0.\nTrough the content in Table 11, we can deduce nodes\nthat can be replaced\
    \ with each other. For example, B1 and B2\ncan replace each other, as shown in\
    \ the proof below:\n∵Sub(t) · a| Sub(t6) · Pub(t6)B1| Pub(t6) · c,\n∴⇒c TSR(t6,\
    \ B1)a;\n∵\nSub(t2) · a| Sub(t2) · Sub(t5)B2| Sub(t5) · c,\nPub(t1) · a| Pub(t1)\
    \ · Pub(t6)B1| Pub(t6) · c,\n⎧\n⎨\n⎩\n∴⇒B1 ≈ B2.\n(2)\nTis comes to the conclusion\
    \ c!(t, B2)a. Tis means\nwhen broker B1 crashes, the B2 can replace B1, with\n\
    Structural Operational Semantics depicted as follows:\nc ⟶\nPub(t6)B1 ⟵\nSub(t6)a\
    \ ≈ c ⟵\nSub(t6)B2 ⟶\nPub(t6)a.\n(3)\nTe Algorithm 3 is showed below.\n4. Implementation\
    \ and Evaluation with\nMosquitto or IoTivity\nWe implement a working prototype\
    \ of the above algorithm\nusing C and MQTTon Ubuntu system with Mosquitto and\
    \ its\nclient libmosquitto.lib as shown in Figure 10. MQTT is a\nmachine to machine\
    \ open source protocol originally developed\nby IBM. MQTTis particularly suitable\
    \ for resource constrained\nIoT devices on fragile networks environment. As discussed\
    \ in\nSection 1, MQTT is the most popular protocol used in IoT\nsystem now. And\
    \ Mosquitto is an open source implementation\nof the MQTT protocol.\nIn our evaluation\
    \ system, Figure 10, we deployed 25\nnodes and divided nodes into two groups,\
    \ one as broker and\nanother as client. On the clients, we deployed a shell pro-\n\
    gram to continuously publish data. And the nodes in broker\nnetwork collect the\
    \ data with subscription.\n4.1. Eﬃciency with Scale of Data Transmission. Intuitively,\
    \ in\nresource constrained device, the eﬃciency will decrease\ndramatically with\
    \ data scale increasing. Te trend of data\ntransmission with data scale is one\
    \ of the experimental\ncontents of in this section. Especially to the speciﬁc\
    \ protocol,\nthe data transmission laws are more worthy of attention. In\nthis\
    \ section, we will evaluate the average transmission time\nwith increased data\
    \ scale. In Figure 11, vertical axis is time\ncost, and horizontal axis is the\
    \ amount of data transmitted.\nFrom Figure 11, we can observe that average transfer\
    \ com-\npletion time will increase dramatically from a speciﬁc point.\nIn broker\
    \ network, a huge number of topics will be\ntransmitted through the nodes. However,\
    \ according to the\nabove experiments, we know that the eﬃciency will decrease\n\
    dramatically with increasing topics transmitted. Terefore,\nreducing the number\
    \ of transmission nodes can reduce\npropagation delay time, and improve the transmission\
    \ ef-\nﬁciency. Tis is just our primary goal in this paper. As the\nevaluation\
    \ system shows with our algorithms proposed in\nthis paper we can reduce the number\
    \ of transmission nodes,\nwhich can improve the data transmission eﬃciency. At\
    \ the\nsame time, according to the experiment results, whole\nsystem eﬃciency\
    \ will be improved as evident from the ex-\nperiment results in the next section.\n\
    4.2. Eﬃciency Improvements. As Figure 12 showed, we used\n25 virtual machines\
    \ as a testbed to test algorithms proposed\nin this paper. Resources allocated\
    \ to a virtual machine are\nlimited. For example, memory in each node is less\
    \ than\n300 M. And the nodes are divided into two groups: one\ngroup is mainly\
    \ for broker network and the other group is\nused for generating data. We deployed\
    \ a Mosquitto broker in\neach node. In order to test any scale of the data, we\
    \ used an\nendless loop shell script to publish a topic per second\ncontinuously;\
    \ the script is as follows:\n#!/bin/sh\nwhile true; do\necho hello.\nsleep 1\n\
    done | mosquitto_pub −l −t “Topic”\nTe other nodes can get the data through Mosquitto_sub\n\
    with a counter. Te counter is used to control the data scale.\nIn the program,\
    \ except subscription and counter, we cal-\nculate the time of data transmission.\
    \ Trough a series of\nsubscription behaviors, the contents with corresponding\n\
    topics can be passed to the ﬁnal data consumer indirectly\nnode by node and step\
    \ by step. Each node automatically\nbecomes a data generator pump. Just as described\
    \ above, we\nhave built an IoT simulation network with libmosquitto\nlibrary and\
    \ virtual machines as shown Figure 12, where\nX\nY\nt\nA\nB\nt\nt\nt\nFigure 8:\
    \ A ≈ B.\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n9\nnodes 1 ∼ 7 are broker network\
    \ nodes; the rest of the nodes\nare data generator. Node 1 is the ﬁnal data consuming\
    \ node.\nNode 6 is the edge routing node. Data collected from the IoT\nwill be\
    \ transmitted to node 6 ﬁrst and then transmitted to\nnode 1 through broker networks.\n\
    Just as described above, our algorithm can determine nodes\nwhere the topic and\
    \ corresponding data reside, and it\ndynamically adopts the shortest paths between\
    \ nodes in data\nconsumer and edge routers. Te shortest paths mean fewer\nnodes\
    \ needed for data transmission. Fewer transmission nodes\ncan save data transmission\
    \ time. We use the network topology\nshown in Figure 12 to evaluate the algorithms\
    \ presented in this\npaper. In Figure 12, the data may be transmitted through\
    \ ⑥,\n⑦, ④ ③, ②, and ①. And the shortest path is ⑥, ④, ②, and\nPub/Sub ﬂow controller\n\

    \ system.\n10\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n①, as shown in Figure 13.\
    \ Tat is to say, the path in Figure 13 is\njust the path we want to use to transmit\
    \ the data.\nTo get the inﬂuence of the data transmission path with the\ndata\
    \ scale, we obtain the evaluation results with diﬀerent\nworkload to test the\
    \ algorithm. Te primary performance\nmetrics are data transmission completion\
    \ time. We get the data\nfrom 500 to 10000 items with 500 as a step. We run a\
    \ Mos-\nquitto on each node in transmission network as a broker. At\nthe same\
    \ time, we develop a program based on libmosquitto as\na client to get the data\
    \ and calculate the transmission com-\npletion time on each node. Figure 14 shows\
    \ the performance\ncomparison of our algorithm with diﬀerent amounts of time.\n\
    At the same time, to compare the entire system performance\ninﬂuence, the average\
    \ transmission completion times of all\nnodes are measured, which is shown in\
    \ Figure 15. In fact fewer\ntransmission nodes can reduce energy consumption for\
    \ whole\nsystem, which is not the scope of this paper.\nWe compare the data transmission\
    \ with and without the\nshortest path in Figure 14. First, we observe that almost\
    \ in\neach data scale the transmission completion time with the\nshortest path\
    \ is far less than without it. Second, the amount\nof data transmitted and the\
    \ transmission completion time is\nnot a simple linear relationship. Te comparison\
    \ of trans-\nmission completion time about edge router is depicted in\nFigure\
    \ 16. We illustrate the inﬂuence to the transmission\nnode under these two diﬀerent\
    \ situations using Figure 16. In\nFigure 16, we observe that the data transmission\
    \ path has an\nimportant inﬂuence on the whole system performance. Te\nsolution\
    \ in edge router and in ﬁnal data consumer has a\nsimilar trend. It is suﬃcient\
    \ to show that data transmission\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0\n10\n\

    11\npath has a signiﬁcant impact on the network system. We can\nsee from the results\
    \ that the shortest path has high eﬃciency.\nIn order to further verify this view,\
    \ we compute the\naverage transmission completion time of all the nodes in the\n\
    path shown in Figure 15 and observe similar trend as in\nFigure 16.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    We have presented novel topics-based data routing proto-\ncols and algorithms\
    \ in MQTT. Te routing algorithms\noptimize IoT data transfers with constrained\
    \ resource and\nfragile network environments in publish-subscribe model.\nOur\
    \ proposed algorithms can adapt the dynamical network\ntopology and are capable\
    \ of adopting continuously changing\ndevices with rerouting method in IoT system.\
    \ Trough\nexperimental results, we have demonstrated eﬃciency of our\nalgorithms\
    \ for message routing, and dynamically adapting\nthe continually changing device\
    \ and network topology. We\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n2000\n4000\n\

    \ prototype with a\nMosquitto based on MQTT protocol. With the experiments\nperformed\
    \ and simulations on Mosquitto, the results show\nthat our algorithms work well.\
    \ Te proposed algorithms can\nbe widely used in IoT system with publish-subscribe\
    \ model.\nMoreover, the algorithms have the capability to be tested in\nother\
    \ protocols such as CoAP [25]. From security point of\nview, identity and authorization\
    \ of nodes are critical\nproblems [26–30]. Treats such as avoiding data to be\n\
    published or subscribed by attackers will have adverse eﬀects\non the broker in\
    \ IoT system. In this work, we have focused\non the data exchange eﬃciency in\
    \ IoT, mainly under the\nMQTTprotocol; in our future work, we aim to study security\n\
    issues in IoT [31–34].\nFrom security view, identity and authorization of nodes\n\
    are critical problems avoiding data to be published or\nsubscribed by hacker or\
    \ crack down the broker in IoT. In this\npaper, we focus on the data exchange\
    \ eﬃciency in IoT,\nmainly under the MQTT protocol and not involving the\nsecurity\
    \ problem, which we will deeply research in future\nwork.\nData Availability\n\

    \ has contributed to the IoT’s improvement. IoT devices are equipped with\nvarious\

    \ of such\ndevices is associated with securing communication between devices and\
    \ users. The key stages of\ncommunication are the processes of authentication\
    \ and the process of agreeing on session keys\nbecause they are the basis of the\

    \ are used to secure communication. These protocols deﬁne the course of communication\n\
    and cryptographic techniques employed for securing. In this article, we have reviewed\
    \ the latest\ncommunication protocols designed to secure authentication processes\
    \ and agree on session keys in IoT\nenvironments. We analyzed the proposed protocols’\
    \ security level, vulnerability, and computational\nand communication costs. We\
    \ showed our observations, describing the requirements that a secure\nprotocol\
    \ should meet.\nKeywords: Internet of things; security; security protocols\n1.\
    \ Introduction\nThe rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has\
    \ made the IoT\napplicable in many areas of life and contributed to its improvement\
    \ [1]. We can ﬁnd IoT\ndevices in everyday life because we use intelligent washing\
    \ machines, TV sets, and light\nbulbs. In combination with appropriate sensors,\
    \ these devices intelligently control the\nlighting or water heating in a building.\
    \ They can also protect our security with tracking\ndevices [2–5]. In medical\
    \ IoT, devices help to control the vital functions of chronically\nill people,\
    \ test blood glucose levels in people with diabetes, signal the patient’s need\
    \ for\nmedications, and deliver them to the patient on time [6–8]. One of the\
    \ typical applications\nof IoT in the industry to alert people about the possibility\
    \ of an earthquake [9]. Athletes\ncan also use IoT to control vital functions\
    \ and performance to prevent life-threatening\nsituations [10–12].\nIoT devices\
    \ are equipped with various sensors (for example, temperature, pressure,\nand\
    \ velocity sensors) that enable them to perform the tasks for which they were\
    \ designed.\nSensors process signals from their work environment and then react\
    \ to them appropriately.\nFor example, if the room temperature is too high, the\
    \ heating devices will be switched\noff to lower the temperature. IoT devices\
    \ can also communicate with each other to con-\nvey relevant information [13–15].\
    \ Usually, the connected sensors form wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs), within\
    \ which various operations and data exchanges are performed.\nBoth networks, IoT\
    \ and WSN, primarily use the standards IEEE 802.15.4 [16], NFC [17],\n6LoWPAN\
    \ [18], MQTT [19], and Bluetooth Low Energy [20] for communication.\nCommunication\
    \ between IoT devices requires the use of various protocols that will\ndeﬁne the\
    \ purpose of the communication, the sequence of steps performed during it,\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2023, 13, 404. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13010404\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n2 of 23\nand cryptographic techniques used to secure\
    \ the transmitted information. The protocol’s\npurpose may be to support communication\
    \ between devices, but the protocol may also\ntarget aspects of communication\
    \ security. Here, the protocol’s goals can be the mutual\nauthentication of the\
    \ parties as well as the agreement of the session key. Usually, these\nprotocols\
    \ are described as security protocols. Securing communication is a necessary activ-\n\
    ity due to the possibility of various cyberattacks. Attacking users can try to\
    \ intercept and\nmodify transmitted messages, as well as steal conﬁdential information\
    \ [21–26]. In addition,\nthe implementation of protocols in networks of interconnected\
    \ IoT devices must take into\naccount technical aspects such as the purpose of\
    \ the network, the energy demand of the\ndevices and the type of communication\
    \ that will be carried out in it [27].\nIn the case of security protocols, it\
    \ is essential to verify their correct operation, check\nwhether they provide\
    \ an appropriate level of security and whether they are not vulnerable\nto the\
    \ latest methods of attacks. When verifying security protocols, we can use methods\n\
    such as time automatics [28,29], BAN logic [30], GNY logic [31], real-or-random\
    \ (ROR) [32],\nrandom Oracle model (ROM) [33], or Syverson-Van Oorschot (SVO)\
    \ logic [34]. In addi-\ntion, protocol veriﬁcation is possible with such tools\
    \ as Scyther [35,36], Tamarin [37,38],\nProVerif [39–41], Avispa [42], or the\
    \ tools mentioned in [22,43], or [44].\n1.1. Motivations and Contributions\nTechnology\
    \ surrounds us from almost every side. We use various intelligent devices\nthat,\
    \ above all, make our lives easier but also transfer large amounts of data. Often,\
    \ the sent\nmessages contain sensitive data related to users’ devices. Thus, the\
    \ need to secure data\nis an essential aspect of the operation of intelligent\
    \ systems. Users require that the use of\ntechnological facilities is safe for\
    \ them, both in protecting human health and life, as well as\nin data processing.\n\
    As a rule, the communication process consists of several stages. Specially designed\n\
    protocols are used to secure each of these steps. These, in turn, are exposed\
    \ to malicious\nusers who look for security vulnerabilities to intercept and then\
    \ use the data. The user\nauthentication and key agreement stages deserve special\
    \ attention here, as the security\nof subsequent communication phases depends\
    \ on their safe course. We are aware that\ntechnological progress also entails\
    \ the development of attack techniques. Therefore it is\nnecessary to regularly\
    \ review the level of security implemented by the protocols securing\nindividual\
    \ stages of communication. Properly selected and safe protocols will certainly\n\
    increase IoT devices’ security level. So, in this arithmetic, we provide an overview\
    \ of how\nto secure the authentication processes and the reconciliation and agreement\
    \ of keys using\nsecurity protocols in WSNs.\nWe believe that studying the work\
    \ of protocols that secure the authentication process\nand session key agreement\
    \ in IoT can help readers understand the state of art in both\ntheory and practice.\
    \ We will explain what security problems and threats are exposed to\nIoT devices\
    \ operating in such networks. In addition, we will discuss the security levels\n\
    offered by the protocols used in IoT or WSNs. We will also highlight the challenges\
    \ and\nrequirements for the newly designed protocols.\n1.2. Methodology\nWe collected\
    \ articles that use various search engines (mainly Google Scholar and\nDBLP) during\
    \ our research. Moreover, we analyzed references from found articles and\ncitations\
    \ to these papers. Our goal was to compose the most complete and up-to-date\n\
    review of the security of authentication and session key agreement protocols operating\
    \ in\nIoT systems.\n1.3. Organization\nThe rest of this paper is organized as\
    \ follows. Section 2 presents the characteristics of\nthe IoT and WSNs. Next,\
    \ we will discuss cryptographic techniques used in cryptographic\nprotocols, the\
    \ security requirements, and problems. Moreover, we will discuss typical\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n3 of 23\ncyberattacks in IoT systems. In Section 3, we provide\
    \ an overview of the protocols used\nin IoT systems for the authentication process\
    \ and session key agreement and distribution.\nIn Section 4, we will summarize\
    \ and conclude our analysis of the discussed protocols. We\nwill focus on the\
    \ security and technical aspects of these protocols. In addition, we will\ninclude\
    \ our insights and research directions for the future. In the last section, we\
    \ will\npresent the conclusions of the entire article, ﬁndings from the research,\
    \ and our plans for\nthe future.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this section, we\
    \ will present theoretical aspects of the operation of the IoT and\nWSNs. We will\
    \ discuss the types and classes of threats that await connected devices and\n\
    their users. In addition, we will highlight the importance of using protocols\
    \ that secure the\nauthentication process and key agreement in IoT systems and\
    \ WSNs.\n2.1. Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks\nThe Internet of\
    \ things is a technology in which connected smart objects can directly\nor indirectly\
    \ collect, process or exchange data via a computer network. Devices can com-\n\
    municate automatically and without human intervention by using the available network\n\
    connections. The IoT concept is used in many aspects of human life (industry,\
    \ city man-\nagement, medicine, household, mobility). Depending on the application,\
    \ the IoT can be\ndivided into subcategories, such as the industrial IoT or medical\
    \ IoT. Among IoT devices,\nwe can indicate sports bands that can measure one’s\
    \ heart rate on an ongoing basis, count\nsteps taken, or monitor sleep. Other\
    \ intelligent devices are voice assistants, thanks to which,\nby using voice commands,\
    \ we can receive the necessary information and control other de-\nvices connected\
    \ to the network, such as smart bulbs, refrigerators, TVs, or ovens [2,3,45–48].\n\
    We put together IoT solutions and typical cyberattacks on IoT systems in Figure\
    \ 1.\nFigure 1. IoT solutions and typical cyberattacks on IoT systems.\nIoT devices\
    \ are often equipped with various types of sensors that detect and react\nto characteristic\
    \ properties of the environment, such as speed, temperature, and altitude.\nSensors\
    \ can also collect and exchange data with other sensors, devices, end users, servers,\n\
    or clouds. Hence, IoT networks often implement wireless sensor network (WSN) technology\n\
    to collect and transmit data. WSNs are characterized by mobility, reliability,\
    \ node hetero-\ngeneity, real-time data transmission, and reaction to sensor failures.\
    \ WSN networks are also\nused to monitor a speciﬁc environment and react to changes\
    \ occurring in it [45,46,49–51].\n2.2. Cryptographic Methods\nCryptography is\
    \ the science of creating the algorithms and protocols necessary to\nprotect information.\
    \ Information protection is related to such concepts as data encryption,\nelectronic\
    \ communication privacy protection, authentication, or key agreement [52–55].\n\
    The most characteristic process related to cryptography is the encryption process.\
    \ It consists\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n4 of 23\nof transforming information\
    \ from plaintext into a form that will be incomprehensible\nto outsiders.\nEncryption\
    \ is the process of transforming (encrypting) information (plaintext) into a\n\
    form that is incomprehensible to outsiders. An encrypted message is called a ciphertext.\n\
    The reverse of encryption is the decryption process, which recovers the original\
    \ message,\nor plaintext, from the ciphertext. The security of cryptographic algorithms\
    \ is often achieved\nby using an additional secret parameter known as a cryptographic\
    \ key. Their use ensures\nthat even if the intruder knows the algorithm used to\
    \ encrypt the message, he will not be\nable to decrypt it unless he has the key.\
    \ Thus, the ciphertext is safe as long as the secret key\nused in communication\
    \ is [52–54,56,57].\nKey encryption algorithms can be divided into symmetric and\
    \ asymmetric [16]. In sym-\nmetric algorithms, also called secret-key algorithms,\
    \ it is possible to obtain a decryption key\nfrom an encryption key. There are\
    \ also situations in which the keys are identical. In the case\nof symmetric algorithms,\
    \ a secret key must be agreed upon between the communicating\nparties before commencing\
    \ communication using a secure method. This is related to the\nproblem of key\
    \ agreement. To have a safe, symmetrically encrypted feed, we need a secure\n\
    communication channel to forward the key [54,58,59].\nOn the other hand, asymmetric\
    \ algorithms use key pairs assigned to users. Such a\npair are the public and\
    \ private keys. Difﬁe and Hellman presented the concept of a public\nkey in [60].\
    \ The public key is known to all users, and anyone possessing it can encrypt\n\
    their messages. However, the ciphertexts obtained this way can only be deciphered\
    \ with\nthe corresponding private key. The user must be sure that his public key\
    \ corresponds to\nhis private key. Thus, the public key encrypts, and the private\
    \ key decodes the message.\nHowever, there is a situation in which the roles of\
    \ the keys are reversed. If the message is\nencrypted with the private key, the\
    \ resulting ciphertext becomes the so-called electronic\nsignature, i.e., protection\
    \ against unauthorized modiﬁcation. Decryption is then possible\nby using the\
    \ public key [54,58,59].\nWhen the data to be signed is large, it takes a long\
    \ time to sign. Hash functions or\nhashes are used in these situations, and their\
    \ operation is based on appropriately processing\nextensive data to a smaller\
    \ size. Hash functions are primarily used to check and conﬁrm the\nauthenticity\
    \ of data, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with in an unauthorized\n\
    manner. The mentioned functions are unidirectional, so it is impossible to reconstruct\n\
    the data based on the hash itself. This means that the whole message that has\
    \ been\nsigned [61,62] must be sent with the electronic signature.\n2.3. Cyberattacks\
    \ on IoT Systems\nCommunication in IoT environments is exposed to various attacks.\
    \ The attacks’ results\nalso can be multiple, and everything depends on the attacker’s\
    \ knowledge, intentions, and\nimagination. For example, the attacks’ effects may\
    \ be data loss, interception, or modiﬁcation.\nWe can indicate many kinds of attacks\
    \ in IoT. We summarised common attacks in IoT in\nTable 1.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13,\
    \ 404\n5 of 23\nTable 1. Typical attacks in IoT.\nAttack\nDescription\nReferences\n\
    Replay attack\nThe attacker intercepts trafﬁc and sends correspondence to its\
    \ original target,\nduplicate packets can be sent many times to the recipients.\n\
    [63,64]\nSpooﬁng attack\nThe attacker tries to hide the communication or identity\
    \ so that it appears to be\nassociated with a trusted, authorized source.\n[65]\n\
    Stolen (smart card, veriﬁer)\nattack\nThe attacker can guess or steals the password;\
    \ for example, when the smart card is\nlost, also he can use the stolen veriﬁer\
    \ directly to impersonate the authorized\nparticipant of the communication.\n\
    [66]\nMan in the Middle attack\n(MITM)\nThe attacker disrupts communication between\
    \ two nodes by injecting a malicious\nnode between legitimate nodes.\n[64,67]\n\
    Impersonation attack\nThe attacker uses the identity of another user (user, server,\
    \ gateway, node, IoT\ndevice).\n[68–70]\n(Privileged)-insider attack.\nThe attacker,\
    \ or insider, is authorized to access the system, then the insider can use\nhis\
    \ access to the data breach.\n[64]\nKnown session-speciﬁc\ntemporary information\n\
    (KSSTI) attack\nThe attacker can calculate the session key based on temporary\
    \ information.\n[71]\n(Ofﬂine password) guessing\nattack\nThe attacker tries iteratively\
    \ to guess a password or other login details to\nimpersonate the user.\n[72]\n\
    Denial of Service (DoS)\nattack\nThe attacker ﬂoods the network with signals,\
    \ which results in network closure.\n[64,67,73]\nSinkhole attack\nThe attacker\
    \ announces updates of routing information, thus attracting network\ntrafﬁc, and\
    \ as a consequence, it may launch further attacks.\n[64,67]\nDesynchronisation\
    \ attack\nThe attacker tries to destroy synchronization between the nodes.\n[74]\n\
    (Sensor node, IoT device)\ncapture attack, cloning attack\nThe attacker hijacks\
    \ a sensor node or IoT device to take over the network, remove\nthe node from\
    \ the network, and redeploys it as a malicious node.\n[64,75,76]\nkey compromise\n\
    impersonation (KCI) attack\nThe attacker installs the client’s certiﬁcate on the\
    \ device and can then impersonate it.\n[77]\nAn essential aspect of security that\
    \ must be considered in IoT systems is the imple-\nmentation of the CIA triad\
    \ (conﬁdentiality, integrity, availability). This is a model aimed\nat the steering\
    \ of security policy. Conﬁdentiality protects us from unauthorized attempts\n\
    to access conﬁdential information. Integrity ensures data consistency, accuracy,\
    \ and relia-\nbility. Availability ensures that access to data will be easy for\
    \ authorized parties [78]. The\nsecurity protocols are one of the methods that\
    \ implement mentioned rules. The protocols\nare short programs that describe the\
    \ communications course and rules. They can secure\ncommunication and ensure security\
    \ aspects like mutual authentication, user anonymity,\nperfect forward or backward\
    \ secrecy, or untraceability [26,79].\nThe security protocols play a signiﬁcant\
    \ security function during the users’ com-\nmunication. They deﬁne a sequence\
    \ of steps during which users execute activities like\nauthentication, authorization,\
    \ key agreement, and exchange. We can highlight that secu-\nrity protocols ensure\
    \ secure authentication and authorization processes so that they can\nprevent\
    \ unauthorized access by dishonest users. Moreover, they support key agreement\n\
    and exchange processes, so the users should be sure that a secure channel provides\
    \ their\ncommunication. Unfortunately, many protocols can be broken because they\
    \ do not provide\nadequate security. Users’ information can be stolen and used\
    \ by attackers. The following\nsection will overview existing security protocols\
    \ for the IoT or WSNs. We will focus on\nprotocols for authentication and agreement\
    \ of the session key. In addition, we will discuss\nthe security levels offered\
    \ by these protocols.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n6 of 23\n3. Security Protocols\
    \ for the Internet of Things\nCommunication in various IoT environments usually\
    \ consists of several stages using\nspecially designed security protocols. The\
    \ stages of authentication and agreement of the\nsession key are the most characteristic\
    \ stages of communication. During authentication,\nthe user or device conﬁrms\
    \ their identity. As a result of correct authentication, the user or\ndevice acquires\
    \ certain rights and privileges depending on the system. Various mechanisms\n\
    are used in authentication protocols to ensure an appropriate level of security\
    \ (for example,\nusing methods described in Section 2.2). An essential element\
    \ of authentication protocols\nis the number of factors used in the authentication\
    \ process. It is worth indicating three\ngroups of factors that are used during\
    \ the authentication process:\n•\nKnowledge factor relates to something the user\
    \ knows, e.g., username and password;\n•\nOwnership factor refers to something\
    \ the user has, e.g., a smart card or security\ntoken; and\n•\nInheritance factor\
    \ refers to the user’s biometric characteristics, i.e., something the user\ncan\
    \ be identiﬁed by, such as a ﬁngerprint or an iris pattern.\nAn equally important\
    \ stage of communication is distributing the session key. The keys\nare used to\
    \ encrypt and decrypt messages. There are many different approaches to the\nproblem\
    \ of session key agreement. We can deﬁne a separate protocol for these purposes\
    \ and\nextract a fragment of the authentication protocol that will be responsible\
    \ for the agreement\nof the session key (e.g., [80]).\nAs mentioned earlier, the\
    \ most desirable features of security protocols are connected\nwith the implementation\
    \ of the CIA triad (conﬁdentiality, integrity, availability). Data\nconﬁdentiality\
    \ is critical in IoT environments. Any situation that threatens the security of\n\
    such environments can contribute to the threat to users’ privacy and their data.\
    \ Data can be\nstolen and misused. Data conﬁdentiality is essential in any situation,\
    \ but it becomes crucial\nwhen communication concerns patients’ health data. An\
    \ excellent solution to secure data\nand thus ensure data conﬁdentiality is the\
    \ use of elliptic curve algorithms, which use the\nmathematics of elliptic curves.\
    \ Usually, these algorithms are considered in the case of the\nRivest–Shamir–Adleman\
    \ algorithm as an alternative cryptographic method. Elliptic curve\nalgorithms\
    \ use a smaller key size than the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithm.\nThe second\
    \ security feature is data integrity, ensuring data consistency, accuracy,\nand\
    \ reliability. Here, the characteristic technology has become blockchain technology.\n\
    Blockchain can be deﬁned as a register of decentralized data that is securely\
    \ shared between\nusers. The data is divided into shared blocks, linked to unique\
    \ identiﬁers in the form of\ncryptographic hashes. The use of blockchain technology\
    \ enables accessible collection,\nintegration, and sharing of data.\nThe last\
    \ security feature is availability, ensuring that access to data will be easy\
    \ for\nauthorized parties. We can use biometric techniques and physical unclonable\
    \ functions to\nsupport data availability. Physical unclonable functions use randomness\
    \ to give an object a\nunique “ﬁngerprint”. Thanks to this, only users or devices\
    \ with deﬁned permissions will\ngain access to data.\nBelow in this Section, we\
    \ will present a comprehensive review of the latest authen-\ntication protocols,\
    \ including authentication protocols with key agreement phases for IoT\nsolutions.\
    \ We will deliver them, dividing them according to their use (medicine and health-\n\
    care, edge, industry, vehicles, drones, and general IoT solutions). This review\
    \ will support\nthe summary of the characteristics and features of the protocols\
    \ that occurred in the IoT or\nWSN environments.\nRasslan et al. in [81] have\
    \ proposed identity-based strong designated veriﬁer signature\nauthentication\
    \ protocols for medical IoT solutions. The proposed protocols can support the\n\
    authentication process of the IoT device network, which consists of both typical\
    \ devices\ndesigned to control the vital functions of patients and autonomous\
    \ vehicles and drones.\nA characteristic feature of both solutions is their short\
    \ signature size. Moreover, the au-\nthors showed that both schemes are characterized\
    \ by low communication and computing\ncosts compared to similar solutions. The\
    \ authors conﬁrmed that the proposed protocols\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n7 of\
    \ 23\nmeet the assumptions of the ROM and protect patient privacy, and ensure\
    \ data integrity\nand authenticity.\nMasud et al. in [82] have proposed an authentication\
    \ protocol for medical IoT solutions.\nThe proposed protocol is based on blockchain\
    \ [83] and fog calculations, Ethereum-powered\nsmart contracts [84], PUF, and\
    \ biometrics. Blockchain and fog technology ensure nonre-\npudiation, transparency,\
    \ low latency, and efﬁcient bandwidth use. Other technologies are\nused to prevent\
    \ replay, spooﬁng, and cloning attacks. The authors checked and conﬁrmed\nthe\
    \ protocol’s security by using the Scyther tool. Moreover, they compared their\
    \ protocol\nwith similar computation costs and performance solutions. The authors\
    \ showed that the\nproposed protocol could be successfully used in healthcare\
    \ networks that use devices with\nlimited resources.\nChander et al. in [85] also\
    \ addressed medical safety issues. The authors focused on\nsolutions for telecare\
    \ medicine information systems [86]. They proposed an authentication\nprotocol\
    \ that uses hash functions, random functions, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID)\n\
    technology [87], and bitwise logical operations [88]. They checked the correctness\
    \ and\nsecurity of the proposed protocol with the help of BAN and GNY logics and\
    \ Avispa and\nScyther tools. These studies have shown that the protocol is resistant\
    \ to typical attacks\noccurring in IoT networks and meets the most crucial security\
    \ properties. However,\nSoni et al. in [89] have reexamined the protocol apportioned\
    \ by Chander et al. in [85].\nThe authors showed that despite the use of hashing\
    \ functions that reduce computing costs\nof endpoint devices, storage and communication\
    \ costs are higher.\nConsequently, there may be delays in the transmission of\
    \ medical data. Moreover, they\nhave shown that this protocol is susceptible to\
    \ impersonation, insider, stolen smart card,\nMITM, and modiﬁcation attacks. Furthermore,\
    \ the protocol does not include the possibility\nof changing the password, which\
    \ signiﬁcantly affects the security of data transmission.\nWang et al. in [90]\
    \ proposed a protocol for medical IoT that protects patient data from\nillegal\
    \ access by unauthorized servers. The authors created an encryption method for\
    \ this\nprotocol based on cyclic shift and XOR operation. Thanks to it, the protocol\
    \ maintains the\nsafety of users but does not burden devices. The authors demonstrated\
    \ the security of the\nproposed protocol by using the BAN logic. Moreover, they\
    \ have shown that the protocol is\nresistant to typical attacks in IoT environments.\
    \ The authors also compared their protocol\nwith similar solutions and obtained\
    \ satisfactory results in achieving safety attributes and\nenergy consumption\
    \ during communication and calculations.\nPrasanalakshmi et al. in [91] focused\
    \ on IoT solutions in the healthcare ﬁeld. The au-\nthors designed a protocol\
    \ by using the AES [92] and blowﬁsh [93] algorithms to encrypt\nmedical data,\
    \ the Koblitz method to choose the embedding points [94] curve, and hyperel-\n\
    liptic curve [95] for embedding medical data in a medical image. The embedded\
    \ image\nprepared in this way is then compressed with a ﬁve-level discrete wavelet\
    \ transform ﬁle to\nachieve a reasonable payload. The authors conﬁrmed the proposed\
    \ method’s correctness,\nespecially in medical image processing. Moreover, they\
    \ suggested that the protocol could\nbe used in real-time applications.\nChen\
    \ et al. in [96] introduced the LAP-IoHT protocol, a three-factor authentication\n\
    protocol designed for health-related IoT solutions. Authentication is based on\
    \ using the\nsmart card, passwords, and biometric features. The authors conducted\
    \ a safety analysis\nof the proposed protocol based on the ROR model. Research\
    \ has shown that the protocol\nis resistant to replay attacks, user impersonation\
    \ attacks, server impersonation attacks,\nprivileged-insider attacks, KSSTI attacks,\
    \ and stolen smart card attacks. Moreover, the pro-\ntocol ensures perfect forward\
    \ secrecy. The authors also showed that the LAP-IoHT protocol\nis more computationally\
    \ efﬁcient than similar solutions and has low communication costs.\nAgrahari et\
    \ al. [97] focused on securing communication between doctor and patient.\nThe\
    \ authors proposed a two-factor authentication protocol by using hashing functions\
    \ and\nbilinear pairing. Authentication is based on the smart card and password\
    \ entered by the\nusers. The authors checked the safety and correctness of the\
    \ proposed scheme by using the\nAvispa tool and the BAN logic. The formal and\
    \ informal analyses showed that the protocol\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n8 of 23\n\
    meets the following security properties, mutual authentication, user anonymity,\
    \ perfect\nforward secrecy, and untraceability, and is resistant to MITM, ofﬂine\
    \ password guessing\nattacks, and privileged-insider attacks and replay attacks.\
    \ The authors also compared\ntheir protocol with similar solutions and obtained\
    \ satisfactory results in achieving security\nattributes and energy consumption\
    \ during communication and calculations.\nTanveer et al. in [98] have proposed\
    \ an authentication protocol targeting the telecare\nmedical information system.\
    \ This protocol uses lightweight cryptography-based authen-\nticated encryption\
    \ with associative data and the hash function of the Esch256 [99] hash.\nThe authors\
    \ showed that their protocol ensures the anonymity and privacy of users and is\n\
    resistant to MITM attacks, replay attacks, impersonation attacks and DoS attacks.\
    \ Moreover,\nthe authors used the ROM model and Scyther tools to conﬁrm the level\
    \ of security provided\nby the proposed protocol. Compared to similar solutions,\
    \ this protocol generates lower\ncomputational and communication costs.\nPardeshi\
    \ et al. in [100] highlighted the problems of adequately securing IoT devices\
    \ in\nfog or edge processing. This problem arises with mass-produced IoT devices\
    \ that ignore\nbasic security requirements and make them vulnerable to attacks.\
    \ Therefore, the authors\nproposed a hash–chain fog/edge zero-knowledge protocol,\
    \ the task of which is to au-\nthenticate each other and agree on session keys\
    \ in the fog/cloud processing environment\nfor different devices. In the proposed\
    \ protocol, the authentication process takes place by\nusing a centralized server\
    \ that manages the keys. The protocol consists of the phases:\ninitialization,\
    \ registration, authentication, communication, and revocation. The authors\nconﬁrmed\
    \ the performance and correctness of the protocol on various architectures and\n\
    workstations, including interconnectivity. Moreover, they established the security\
    \ of the\nprotocol using the BAN logic. They also demonstrated the protocol’s\
    \ resistance to active\nand passive attacks, modiﬁcation, sinkhole, monitoring,\
    \ replay, location disclosure, and\nSybil attacks.\nIqbal et al. in [101] proposed\
    \ an authentication protocol with a key agreement for\nIoT and cloud computing\
    \ environments. The authors used elliptic curve algorithms and\nsymmetric encryption/decryption.\
    \ The authors performed a formal protocol security\nanalysis by using BAN logic\
    \ and the Scyther tool. In turn, informal analyses showed the\nprotocol’s resistance\
    \ to replay attacks, impersonation attacks, traceability attacks, message\nintegrity\
    \ attacks, and MITM attacks. Computational and communication cost studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the protocol proposed by Iqbal et al. in [101] is more efﬁcient than\n\
    similar solutions.\nWu et al. in [102,103] focused on IoT-related cloud computing\
    \ solutions. In both years,\nthey used Intel software guard extensions (SGX) [104]\
    \ to improve the security of protocols\nused in cloud solutions. In Wu et al.\
    \ [102], the authors proposed the SAKAP protocol for\nauthentication and session\
    \ key reconciliation. The authors use SGX to store a shared key.\nThe authors\
    \ performed formal (using the ROR model and the ProVerif tool) and informal\n\
    protocol analysis. Research has shown that the protocol is resistant to replay\
    \ attacks, MITM\nattacks, and impersonation attacks and provides security features\
    \ such as anonymity and\nuntraceability. In turn, in [103], the authors proposed\
    \ the SQXAP protocol that can be used\nto authenticate intelligent vehicles in\
    \ cloud systems. The authors also performed formal\n(using the ROR model) and\
    \ informal analyses for this protocol. Research has shown that\nthe protocol is\
    \ resistant to replay attacks, insider attacks, and MITM attacks, and provides\n\
    security properties such as mutual authentication, anonymity, and untraceability.\n\
    Zhao et al. in [105], Zhao et al. focused on industrial IoT (IIoT) security. The\
    \ authors\nnoticed that the low computing power of IIoT devices resulted in the\
    \ low level of security\nimplemented in such networks. The authors proposed a\
    \ three-factor authentication and\nkey-handshake protocol to solve such problems\
    \ based on elliptic curve cryptography.\nThe protocol can work on networks with\
    \ one or more gateways. The authors conﬁrmed\nthe security of this protocol by\
    \ using the ROM model and the Scyther tool. In turn,\ninformal analyses conﬁrmed\
    \ that the protocol provides mutual authentication, session key\nagreement, forward\
    \ and backward secrecy, user anonymity, and untraceability. Moreover,\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2023, 13, 404\n9 of 23\nthe protocol is resistant to stolen smart card attacks,\
    \ replay attacks, privileged-insider\nattacks, desynchronization attacks, and\
    \ impersonation attacks. The authors also compared\ntheir protocol and similar\
    \ solutions for IIoT and obtained satisfactory results in achieving\nsecurity\
    \ attributes and energy consumption during communication and calculations.\nYi\
    \ et al. in [106] also proposed an authentication protocol for IIoT. The proposed\n\
    protocol uses the physically unclonable function (PUF) [107] chip and uses the\
    \ Bloom [108]\nﬁlter to preauthenticate and reduce computation and communication\
    \ costs. The authors\nperformed a formal safety analysis of the proposed protocol\
    \ by using the Avispa tool and\ninformal analysis. The research showed that the\
    \ proposed protocol for ensuring the follow-\ning security properties: mutual\
    \ authentication, identity anonymity, and untraceability and\nforward and backward\
    \ secrecy of session keys, and is also resistant to tampering attacks,\nreplay\
    \ attacks, simulation and forgery attacks, physical attacks, and desynchronization\n\
    attacks. Moreover, the authors compared their protocol with other schemes regarding\n\
    security and computational and communication costs with satisfactory results.\n\
    Panda et al. in [109] focused on industrial IoT solutions and proposed an authenti-\n\
    cation protocol for machine-to-machine communication. The authors tried to minimize\n\
    the computational and communication load while increasing communication security.\n\
    The authors used only XOR operations and hashing functions, and the shared symmetric\n\
    key is only generated after two rounds of communication without human intervention.\n\
    The authors carried out a formal (using BAN logic and the Avispa tool) and informal\n\
    analysis of the protocol’s security, showing that it is resistant to typical attacks\
    \ occurring in\nIoT environments. In conclusion, the authors emphasized the advantages\
    \ of a protocol that\nmeets security properties with low computational and communication\
    \ costs. Moreover,\nthey noted that the protocol could be successfully implemented\
    \ in other IoT domains.\nZhang et al. in [110] have developed an authentication\
    \ protocol for the cross-domain\nIoT environment. The protocol uses the elliptic\
    \ curve digital signature algorithm, blockchain\ntechnology, and a specially designed\
    \ cryptocurrency token to build trust between entities.\nThe authors analyzed\
    \ the safety of the proposed protocol. They showed that it is resistant to\nMITM\
    \ attacks, replay attacks, revealing identity attacks, authority abuse attacks,\
    \ and DoS\nattacks. In addition, they demonstrated its computing and communication\
    \ performance.\nIn turn, Wang et al. in [111] conﬁrmed this protocol’s computing\
    \ and communication\nadvantages. However, they showed that it only allows one-way\
    \ authentication and adds to\nthe burden of certiﬁcate storage.\nLi et al. in\
    \ [112] have proposed a mutual authentication protocol with key hand-\nshaking\
    \ based on blockchain, elliptic curves, and bilinear pairs. The authors replaced\n\
    the centralized CA with the registration authority to avoid single-node failure\
    \ and some\nattacks. In addition, the key recovery and key update scheme use the\
    \ Lagrange interpola-\ntion method [113]. The authors formally conﬁrmed the safety\
    \ of the proposed protocol by\nusing the ProVerif tool and the ECK model [114].\
    \ Informal security analyses have shown\nthat the proposed protocol is resistant\
    \ to typical IoT attacks. Moreover, the authors noted\nthat this protocol’s computational\
    \ and communication overhead is negligible. However,\nRyu et al. in [115] pointed\
    \ out that the protocol barred by Li et al. in [112] user anonymity\nis prone\
    \ to insider attacks.\nHajian et al. in [116] proposed a two-way, mutual authentication\
    \ and key agreement\nprotocol. The protocol involves four phases: initialization,\
    \ registration and generation of\nsecret keys of long duration, key authentication\
    \ and reconciliation, and updating public\nand private keys. The authors, using\
    \ the ROR model, BAN logic and the Scyther tool,\nconﬁrmed the correctness and\
    \ safety of the proposed protocol. Additionally, the informal\nanalysis showed\
    \ resistance to this protocol to replay attacks, MITM attacks, device capture\n\
    attacks, privilege-insider attacks, KCI attacks, known speciﬁc temporary information\n\
    attacks, impersonation attacks, and known-key attacks. In addition, these analyses\
    \ showed\nthat the protocol provides anonymity and untraceability and perfect\
    \ forward/backward\nsecrecy. The authors also assessed their protocol in terms\
    \ of communication, calculation\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n10 of 23\ncosts, and\
    \ energy consumption, and they obtained satisfactory results in comparison with\n\
    similar solutions.\nGong et al. in [117] proposed a lightweight protocol for authenticating\
    \ and negotiating\nsession keys. The proposed protocol uses shared secret and\
    \ elliptic curve public key\ntechnology and is based on the CoAP framework [118].\
    \ The techniques used to ensure\nthe security and anonymity of devices and users.\
    \ The authors veriﬁed the performance\nand safety of the proposed protocol by\
    \ using the Dolev–Yao adversary model [119] and\nthe CPN Tools tool [120]. The\
    \ analysis showed that the protocol provides the following\nsecurity properties:\
    \ conﬁdentiality, data integrity, mutual authentication, perfect forward\nand\
    \ backward secrecy, device anonymity, and unlinkability. The protocol is resistant\n\
    to impersonation attacks, MITM attacks, privileged-insider attacks, replay attacks,\
    \ KCI\nattacks, desynchronization attacks, and DoSs attacks. Moreover, the authors\
    \ compared their\nprotocol with other schemes regarding security and computational\
    \ and communication\ncosts with satisfactory results.\nChen et al. in [121] proposed\
    \ another two-factor authentication and key agreement\nprotocol for IoT environments.\
    \ The proposed protocol consists of the predeployment phase,\nthe IoT device registration\
    \ phase, and the login and authentication phase. The authors\ndistinguished two\
    \ roles: IoT devices and a server. The IoT device must register on the\nserver.\
    \ Further communication between these devices takes place by using a session\n\
    key generated by the server. The authors tested the security of the proposed protocol\n\
    by using the ROR model and the BAN logic. Studies have shown that the protocol\
    \ is\nresistant to privileged-insider attacks, known temporary information disclosure\
    \ attacks,\nstolen veriﬁcation attacks, IoT device simulation attacks, and physical\
    \ IoT device capture\nattacks. In addition, the protocol provides the perfect\
    \ forward secrecy property. Moreover,\nthe authors compared the proposed protocol\
    \ with similar security and computational and\ncommunication cost solutions, obtaining\
    \ satisfactory results.\nAnother mutual authentication protocol was proposed by\
    \ Safkhani et al. in [122].\nThe authors focused on the use of RFID technology\
    \ in the IoT environment. The au-\nthors created a new message authentication\
    \ code function for the proposed protocol by\nanalyzing the existing protocols\
    \ and their problems and possible attacks. The authors\nformally informally veriﬁed\
    \ their protocol’s security (using BAN logic and the Scyther\ntool). The protocol\
    \ is resistant to replay attacks, secret disclosure attacks, impersonation\nattacks,\
    \ and desynchronization attacks. Moreover, the authors showed that their proposed\n\
    protocol is characterized by low computing and communication costs, and therefore\
    \ it can\nbe implemented in environments with low resources and computing power.\n\
    Khorasgani et al. in [123] proposed three lightweight protocols called LRSAS+,\
    \ LRARP,\nand LRARP+ for use in IoT solutions. The authors chose the operations\
    \ performed during\nthe protocol to be safe and computationally light, i.e., they\
    \ do not burden the communi-\ncating devices. The authors conﬁrmed the protocol’s\
    \ security by using GNY logic and the\nScyther tool. The protocol is resistant\
    \ to tag-tracking attacks, replay and reader imperson-\nation attacks, desynchronization\
    \ attacks, and DoSs attacks. In addition, the protocol meets\nforward–backward\
    \ secrecy. The study of the efﬁciency of the proposed protocols also con-\nﬁrmed\
    \ the authors’ initial assumptions regarding not overloading communicating devices.\n\
    Alam et al. [124] have proposed a new authentication protocol for use in IoT environ-\n\
    ments. The authors used the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem [125] properties,\n\
    hash functions, and XOR operations to ensure robust and secure authentication.\
    \ The au-\nthors tested their protocol by using the BAN logic and the Avispa tool\
    \ and demonstrated\nits resistance to forging, guessing, masquerading, DoSs and\
    \ MITM attacks. Moreover,\nthe protocol complies with security properties such\
    \ as user anonymity and untraceability\nor perfect forward secrecy. Furthermore,\
    \ the authors compared the proposed protocol with\nother schemes in terms of security\
    \ and computational and communication costs, obtaining\nsatisfactory results.\
    \ The authors concluded that the proposed protocol can be implemented\nfor various\
    \ applications of IoT devices and that it can be successfully extended with other\n\
    techniques of securing the authentication process.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n\
    11 of 23\nMirsaraei et al. in [126] proposed a three-factor authentication protocol\
    \ for IoT en-\nvironments. The protocol uses blockchain technology, hashing functions,\
    \ XOR, and the\nconcept of a fuzzy extractor. The cryptographic techniques ensure\
    \ an appropriate level of\nsecurity, protect data against manipulation and increase\
    \ the transparency of the recorded\ninformation on smart cards. The authors used\
    \ the BAN logic, the ROR model and the\nAvispa tool for formal analysis. Research\
    \ has shown the security of mutual authentication\nimplemented by the proposed\
    \ protocol.\nConversely, an informal analysis showed that the protocol provides\
    \ data conﬁden-\ntiality, mutual authentication, data integrity, forward security,\
    \ anonymity, authorization,\nthree-factor secrecy, and secured password updating.\
    \ Moreover, the proposed protocol is\nresistant to replay attacks, password-guessing\
    \ attacks, DoS attacks, server impersonation\nattacks, privileged-insider attacks,\
    \ KSSTI attacks, user impersonation attacks, stolen smart\ncard attacks, MITM\
    \ attacks, and brute force attacks. The authors concluded that their\nprotocol\
    \ is superior in computation cost, communication cost, security requirements,\
    \ and\nattack resistance compared to similar solutions.\nSaqib et al. in [127]\
    \ proposed a three-factor authentication protocol for mission-critical\nIoT-based\
    \ applications. The protocol is based on the publish–subscribe model and uses\n\
    elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) and computationally low hash chains. Authentication\n\
    is done through an identity, password, and digital signature. The authentication\
    \ process\nalso generates a dynamic session key based on the value of the nonce.\
    \ Dynamic key changes\nmake the protocol resistant to attacks on session keys.\
    \ An informal protocol security analy-\nsis showed its resistance to MITM attacks,\
    \ smart card stolen attacks, publisher, subscriber,\nor broker impersonation attacks,\
    \ known session key attacks, ofﬂine password guessing\nattacks, replay attacks,\
    \ and privileged-insider attacks. In addition, the protocol provides\nconﬁdentiality,\
    \ mutual authentication and perfect forward secrecy. The formal safety anal-\n\
    ysis was performed by using the Scyther tool. The authors also showed that, compared\n\
    to similar protocols, the proposed protocol saves bandwidth and communication\
    \ energy\nwhile reducing resource-constrained sensor nodes’ computation and communication\
    \ costs.\nHu et al. in [128] focused on the weaknesses of existing IoT authentication\
    \ protocols.\nThe authors opposed a two-factor authentication protocol by using\
    \ ECC, passwords, and\nsmart cards. The authors conducted formal (using the ProVerif\
    \ tool) and informal veriﬁ-\ncation of their protocol. Based on analyses, they\
    \ showed that the protocol is resistant to\nimpersonation attacks, ofﬂine password\
    \ guessing attacks, replay attacks, and sensor node\ncaptured attacks. In addition,\
    \ they found the proposed protocol to be secure, meeting user\nand session key\
    \ security requirements. In addition, it achieves satisfactory results in terms\n\
    of computational costs.\nHaseeb-ur-rehman et al. in [129] introduced a two-factor\
    \ authentication protocol based\non a symmetric key, by using biometrics and a\
    \ password. The proposed protocol consists\nof six phases: the initialization,\
    \ the smart device enrollment, the gateway node enrollment,\nthe user enrollment,\
    \ the login and authentication and the password and biometric update.\nThe authors\
    \ conducted formal (using the Avispa tool) and informal analyses of the safety\n\
    of the proposed protocol. Research has shown that the protocol ensures security\
    \ properties\nsuch as session key freshness property, perfect forward secrecy,\
    \ user anonymity, and un-\ntraceability. In addition, it is resistant to replay\
    \ attacks, impersonation attacks, and MITM\nattacks. The authors also showed that\
    \ their protocol has lower computational costs than\nsimilar protocols.\nKumar\
    \ et al. in [130] focused on IoT solutions for vehicles. The authors proposed\
    \ an\nauthentication protocol based on RFID and PUF technologies. The protocol\
    \ assumes the\npresence of three roles: a tag, a reader, and a cloud server, and\
    \ each of the components\ncan operate independently. The tag is responsible for\
    \ initiating communication with the\nreader, and the reader must validate the\
    \ message sent by the tag and send it to the server.\nThe server is responsible\
    \ for tag and reader authentication. The authors tested the safety\nof the proposed\
    \ protocol by using the ROR model and informal analyses. Research has\nshown that\
    \ the protocol is resistant to ephemeral secret leakage attacks, MITM attacks,\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n12 of 23\ninsider attacks, replay attacks, impersonation\
    \ attacks, ofﬂine password-guessing attacks,\nand desynchronization attacks. Moreover,\
    \ the proposed protocol maintains the following\nsecurity properties: location\
    \ privacy, mutual authentication and session key agreement,\nforward secrecy,\
    \ and message authentication. Furthermore, the authors compared their\nprotocol\
    \ with other schemes regarding security and computational and communication\n\
    costs with satisfactory results.\nGupta et al. in [131] proposed an authentication\
    \ protocol for IoT solutions for vehicles.\nThe authors based the security of\
    \ their protocol on identity-based cryptography [132]\nand lattice cryptography\
    \ [133]. The authors veriﬁed the correctness and security of their\nprotocol by\
    \ using the ROM model. Research has shown that the protocol is resistant to\n\
    MITM attacks, Unknown key-share attacks, and known-key security attacks and provides\n\
    perfect forward secrecy. In addition, the authors compared the protocol with similar\n\
    solutions in terms of reference and communication costs. The authors concluded\
    \ that the\nproposed protocol is computationally efﬁcient and can be implemented\
    \ in real IoT solutions\nfor vehicles.\nZhang et al. in [134] observed that the\
    \ development of IoT systems for vehicles, on the\none hand, contributed to easing\
    \ the trafﬁc load and improving travel efﬁciency. On the\nother hand, these systems\
    \ are exposed to security threats in many respects. Therefore,\nthe authors proposed\
    \ an authentication protocol for such solutions. The proposed protocol\nuses blockchain\
    \ technology and a chaotic mapping algorithm. It allows vehicles and\nroadside\
    \ units to register to obtain a public identity, which they then use to authenticate\n\
    and negotiate the key. The authors conﬁrmed the security of their protocol with\
    \ the Scyther\ntool. Moreover, they showed that the proposed protocol has lower\
    \ computation and\ncommunication costs than the existing schemes.\nBera et al.\
    \ in [135] focused on IoT solutions that use drones in agriculture. The authors\n\
    proposed an authentication and key management protocol based on blockchain technol-\n\
    ogy. The authors examined their protocol for its susceptibility to attacks occurring\
    \ in\nIoT environments. They showed that the protocol is resistant to MITM attacks,\
    \ replay\nattacks, impersonation attacks, privileged-insider attacks, physical\
    \ IoT smart device and\ndrone capture attacks, and ephemeral capture attacks,\
    \ secret leakage attacks. In addition,\nthe authors performed a formal protocol\
    \ analysis by using the ROR model and the Avispa\ntool. In conclusion, the authors\
    \ concluded that the protocol has low computational and\ncommunication costs.\n\
    Tanveer et al. suggested two protocols for IoT drone solutions: a protocol for\
    \ the\nauthentication process in [136], and a protocol for the key agreement process\
    \ in [137,138].\nThese protocols use AES-CBC-256, ECC, SHA-256 hash functions,\
    \ and XOR operations.\nThe authors have demonstrated the resistance of these protocols\
    \ to common attacks occur-\nring in IoT environments, for example, replay attacks\
    \ and MITM attacks. The authors used\nthe ROM model and the Scyther tool for formal\
    \ analysis of the protocols. The authors used\nboth proposed protocols in the\
    \ [139] framework for drones because both are efﬁcient in\nterms of communication,\
    \ storage and computing costs compared to similar solutions.\nJaved et al. in\
    \ [140] have abandoned the blockchain-based authentication protocol and\nthe hyperelliptic\
    \ curve cryptography for IoT drones. In this approach, the blockchain is\nused\
    \ as a certiﬁcation authority, and transactions are deﬁned as certiﬁcates. Such\
    \ action\nis designed to reduce maintenance costs while ensuring a high level\
    \ of communication\nsecurity. The authors concluded that the proposed protocol\
    \ is resistant to common attacks in\ndrone IoT networks and is also cost-effective\
    \ in terms of computation and communication\ncompared to similar solutions.\n\
    4. Discussion\nMany different protocols are available for use in IoT environments,\
    \ with different\ncharacteristics, purposes and applications. As mentioned in\
    \ this manuscript, we focused\non protocols that fulﬁll the purposes of authentication,\
    \ agreement, and agreement of\nthe session key. The protocols may pursue one or\
    \ more of these objectives during their\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n13 of 23\n\
    operation. The overviewed protocols use cryptographic techniques to achieve their\
    \ goals\nand secure communication. These protocols have been validated with various\
    \ tools and\nmethods for vulnerability to attacks and providing essential security\
    \ features.\nIn Table 2, we summarized the revised protocols in terms of the purpose\
    \ they pursue.\nWe have designated three types of protocols based on the analyzes\
    \ performed. Here we can\nobserve the need to create protocols primarily for user\
    \ authentication. An essential aspect\nof communication is the reconciliation\
    \ and agreement of session keys; hence, developing\nand applying this protocol\
    \ is also key to securing communication.\nTable 2. The summary of protocol types.\n\

    \ discussed in terms of their uses and inter-\noperability. We considered protocols\
    \ targeted at speciﬁc solutions such as those intended\nfor medicine and health,\
    \ fog, edge, or cloud computing, and vehicular, drone, or indus-\ntrial purposes.\
    \ However, protocols that can be used in different resolutions (multidomain\n\
    protocols) also play an essential role. In addition to multidomain solutions,\
    \ many security\nprotocols have been developed for solutions related to direct\
    \ human safety, be it physical\nor environmental. First and foremost, it is about\
    \ securing communications in medical\nenvironments where, on the one hand, we\
    \ need to ensure patients ’data and privacy and,\non the other hand, safeguard\
    \ their health and life, as IoT devices are used to control patients’\nvital functions.\
    \ Another important aspect will be the protocols for industrial solutions that\n\
    also relate to securing people environmentally and physically. As in the case\
    \ of medical\nsolutions, we must secure both data sent in industrial networks\
    \ and protect against attacks\nthat could contribute to the incorrect operation\
    \ of industrial devices and thus threaten the\nhealth and life of employees.\n\

    \ those protocols for which the authors conducted formal and\ninformal security\
    \ evidence and indicated which attacks their proposed protocol is resistant\n\
    to. In some papers (such as [81,82,91,134,136] or [137,137,137,137]) lists of\
    \ attacks emerged.\nOn the other hand, in other papers (such as [90,109] or [112]),\
    \ the authors only suggested\nthat their protocols are resistant to typical attacks\
    \ in IoT environments. The table contains a\nlist of attacks and an annotation\
    \ regarding the resistance of the tested protocol to attack.\nWe only included\
    \ those attacks that appear in a few papers. These attacks seemed once\n(e.g.,\
    \ Sybil attack or sinkhole attack) are included in the Others column. The ﬂag\
    \ + indicates\nthat the authors have demonstrated that their proposed protocol\
    \ is immune to attack.\nThe ﬂag - means that the protocol has not been veriﬁed\
    \ to be vulnerable to attack.\nWe have observed that the most frequently tested\
    \ vulnerabilities in IoT environments\nare impersonation attacks, MITM attacks,\
    \ and replay attacks. Most reviewed papers\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 404\n14 of 23\n\
    reported studies of proposed protocols for these attacks, indicating that they\
    \ are among the\nmost dangerous vulnerabilities. These attacks can lead to the\
    \ loss of a signiﬁcant amount of\ninformation, necessitating protection against\
    \ them in IoT environments. The attacker can\ncombine different techniques when\
    \ carrying out an attack. An attacker can listen to and\nintercept network trafﬁc\
    \ and then retransmit it to convince the recipient to perform speciﬁc\nactions.\
    \ The attack results depend on the attacker’s knowledge, skills and imagination\
    \ and\nthe vulnerability and speciﬁcity of the attacked environment. One of the\
    \ most dangerous\noutcomes of an attacker may be the loss of conﬁdential information.\

    -\nThe authors of all overviewed papers have also conducted performance studies\
    \ of\ntheir protocols. The authors compared their proposals with similar solutions\
    \ in terms of\ncommunication and calculation costs and energy consumption. The\
    \ authors found that the\nproposed protocols achieve better performance in all\
    \ studies than comparable solutions.\nTo summarize the overviewed protocols, the\
    \ authentication process is the essential\ncommunication element in IoT environments.\
    \ The process consists of conﬁrming the iden-\ntity of the communicating parties.\
    \ One or more factors may be used during authentication;\nthe more factors, the\
    \ greater the safety of the entire process. If only passwords are used for\nauthentication,\
    \ this can be a weak and vulnerable security. An attacker can intercept, guess\n\
    or crack passwords. Hence, a better solution is to use biometrics as it will avoid\
    \ spooﬁng\nor impersonating attacks.\nAuthentication is vulnerable to rogue users.\
    \ Attackers can launch attacks to obtain\nprivate user information, block the\
    \ operation of selected system components, or cause\nthe system to malfunction.\
    \ The most dangerous attacks are MITM attacks, replay attacks,\nand the impersonation\
    \ mentioned above because they can lead to the loss of user data\nand the compromise\
    \ of essential security properties. The desynchronization attack can be\nequally\
    \ dangerous because, in many IoT environments (for example, medical), proper data\n\
    synchronization is crucial to the entire system’s operation.\nAn essential element\
    \ of securing communication is using session keys, which are\nused to encrypt\
    \ it. To protect communication against a replay attack or MITM attack, it is\n\
    worth using one-time session keys, and messages should be timestamped. Thanks\
    \ to this,\nthe system will unequivocally determine whether a legitimate network\
    \ node generated the\nprocessed message or whether it was intercepted by the attacker\
    \ and resent by him.\nIn addition to the security aspects, we should also bear\
    \ in mind the issues related\nto the scalability of protocols in the IoT environment.\
    \ Devices used in IoT environments,\nor WSN sensors, have limited computing power.\
    \ For this reason, calculations performed on\nindividual devices while the protocol\
    \ is running should not drain its energy. For this reason,\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13,\
    \ 404\n16 of 23\nwhen designing authentication or key agreement protocols, it\
    \ is worth using lightweight\ncryptographic algorithms that will ensure an appropriate\
    \ level of data security but will not\nburden system resources. In turn, data\
    \ storage should be left to centralized units with more\ncomputing and hardware\
    \ resources than individual nodes of the IoT or WSN environment.\nNewly proposed\
    \ protocols should be adequately screened for vulnerability to attacks\nand their\
    \ essential security features. There are many different methods and tools for\
    \ this\n(mentioned in Section 1). In addition, implemented and operational protocols\
    \ should also\nbe systematically checked for this, as the methods used by attackers\
    \ constantly evolve.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this manuscript, we surveyed papers that\
    \ proposed key agreement and authen-\ntication protocols for the Internet of things\
    \ and wireless sensors networks. We collected\npapers focusing on problems with\
    \ security, especially in IoT that offer new protocols aimed\nat correcting vulnerabilities\
    \ in existing protocols. We discussed the theoretical aspects of\nIoT environments,\
    \ cryptographic methods that can be used to secure communication, and\ncyberattacks\
    \ that can compromise the security in the environments under consideration.\n\
    We highlighted the key agreement, distribution process, and authenticating users\
    \ or\ndevices on such networks in this manuscript. These processes provide critical\
    \ communica-\ntion steps as they prevent unauthorised access to session keys and\
    \ unauthorised access by\nunauthorised users or devices. Data transferred between\
    \ network nodes can be of different\nnatures and importance, and they need to\
    \ be appropriately secured during communication.\nAll communications are exposed\
    \ to dishonest users called attackers. Attackers’ activity\nmay involve attacks\
    \ on various aspects of the network, such as passwords, keys, biometric\ndata\
    \ or devices, and eavesdropping and retransmitting the same messages.\nWe looked\
    \ at various solutions related to authentication and matching of session keys.\n\
    The authors of the protocols under consideration focused on essential security\
    \ properties\nsuch as untraceability and anonymity, and the solutions’ authors\
    \ focused on crucial security\nfeatures. The authors also validated their protocols\
    \ with formal and informal methods\nthat considered the vulnerability of these\
    \ protocols. Various techniques (e.g., BAN logic or\nGNY) and automatic tools\
    \ (e.g., Scyther, ProVerif) were used for veriﬁcation. Thanks to\nthe methods\
    \ and tools used, the authors showed what level of security is provided by the\n\
    protocol they propose.\nThe selected protocols’ analysis showed that the most\
    \ dangerous attacks for IoT are\nimpersonation attacks, MITM attacks, and replay\
    \ attacks because the susceptibility to\nthese attacks was most often checked\
    \ and veriﬁed by the authors of the selected works.\nDuring impersonation attacks,\
    \ the attacker identiﬁes himself with another user on the\nnetwork and tries to\
    \ convince other users of his identity. The replay attack involves\nduplicating\
    \ packets and sending them multiple times. At any time during this attack,\nthe\
    \ attacker can also use a MITM attack to intercept transmitted messages. A successfully\n\
    conducted attack may result in the loss of conﬁdential data, which may cause further\n\
    problems for the user. The essential protection principle against attacks is using\
    \ timestamps\nin messages and one-time session keys. Timestamps will allow us\
    \ to verify the time when a\nmessage was generated.\nOn the other hand, disposable\
    \ session keys will prevent the repeated sending of a\nmessage encrypted with\
    \ an outdated key. Other types of attacks cannot be underestimated.\nAttacks during\
    \ which the attacker tries to guess the password (guessing attacks) and the\n\
    loss of data or devices that verify the user (stolen attacks) are equally dangerous.\
    \ Such\nsituations may contribute to the fact that an unauthorized user can log\
    \ in with the correct\ncredentials of an honest user and thus impersonate him.\n\
    After analyzing the current state of knowledge in the security protocols for IoT\
    \ and\nWSN environments, we set out to indicate further research directions in\
    \ this area. Here we\ncan indicate the three most important aspects that should\
    \ pay attention to constructing\nsecure protocols for IoT.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13,\
    \ 404\n17 of 23\nThe ﬁrst is security. Protocols should provide an appropriate\
    \ level of security for\nusers and data sending because the methods of breaking\
    \ security are constantly evolving.\nTherefore, research goals in security protocols\
    \ for IoT and WSN environments should focus\non technologies and solutions that\
    \ provide increasingly better security. The elliptic curve\nalgorithms are particularly\
    \ noteworthy here, because they offer security comparable to the\nRivest–Shamir–Adleman\
    \ algorithm when using shorter encryption keys. Authentication\nand veriﬁcation\
    \ of users’ identities are also essential elements of security. These processes\n\
    should take place, taking into account at least two factors. Authentication using\
    \ only the\nuser’s password does not provide an adequate level of security, especially\
    \ in situations in\nwhich the user uses the same password when logging into many\
    \ services or applications.\nThe best solution worth developing is using biometric\
    \ methods during these two processes.\nBiometric methods allow us to identify\
    \ and conﬁrm the user’s identity.\nThe second aspect of security protocols for\
    \ IoT and WSN environments is performance.\nThe computing load of IoT devices\
    \ during communication should be as low as possible so\nthat devices and their\
    \ users can work efﬁciently without delays. Blockchain is an interest-\ning technology\
    \ in this regard, because it ensures nonrepudiation and data transparency.\nOn\
    \ the other hand, considering calculations in clouds or fog is conducive to achieving\
    \ low\ntransmission delays and efﬁcient bandwidth use.\nThe last aspect to consider\
    \ is cross-platform. Protocols for IoT should be cross-platform.\nSome of the\
    \ protocols reviewed in this manuscript are application-speciﬁc (e.g., in medicine).\n\
    When designing a security protocol for IoT, it is worth considering a broader\
    \ spectrum of\napplications so that one authentication or key agreement and distribution\
    \ protocol can be\nimplemented in many solutions.\nAfter analyzing the current\
    \ state of knowledge in the ﬁeld of protocols for the IoT and\nWSNs environments,\
    \ we set ourselves further research goals. In our next work, we will\nfocus on\
    \ designing and creating a secure communication framework to be implemented\n\
    in IoT. We will include a newly designed and secure communication protocol, thanks\
    \ to\nwhich it will be possible to agree on and distribute the session key and\
    \ user authentication.\nWhen designing and creating the framework and protocol,\
    \ we will consider the security\nfeatures to ensure the safety of users. We will\
    \ also include one-time veriﬁcation credentials,\nkeys, and timestamps to protect\
    \ the environment from attacks.\nAuthor Contributions:\nConceptualization, S.S.\

    \ This systematic literature review provides an extensive categorization of the\
    \ blockchain-\nenabled applications across the domain of vehicular ad hoc networks\
    \ (VANETs). Within the paradigm\nof distributed ledger technology (DLT), the communication\
    \ models and practices for VANETs have\nbeen revolutionized. An analytical review\
    \ and a survey were conducted to explore the advancements\nof blockchain and VANETs.\
    \ The techniques, limitations, and advantages of blockchain deployment\nin VANETs\
    \ are discussed for the effective implementation of a decentralized network. To\
    \ this end,\n68 studies were selected on the basis of the procedural steps to\
    \ provide a comprehensive overview\nof blockchain and the smart contracts in VANETs.\
    \ In particular, a decentralized communication\nmodel is also proposed for the\
    \ advanced implementation of blockchain in VANETs. Researchers and\npractitioners\
    \ are being attracted to these technologies for applications for various industrial\
    \ sectors.\nTherefore, this study also emphasizes the identiﬁcation of any blockchain-related\
    \ open issues for\nfuture prospects. The comprehension of blockchain applications\
    \ for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)\nis also explored in order to ﬁll the research\
    \ gap on advanced communication networks across the\nInternet of Things.\nKeywords:\

    \ of a decentralized network that is responsible for\nrecording transactional\
    \ data or information in the form of blocks that are sequentially\nlinked to each\
    \ other. The architecture of blockchain makes it difﬁcult to tamper with\nand\
    \ difﬁcult to modify information without having a consensus mechanism. In 2008,\n\
    blockchain technology emerged with the revolution in digital currency known as\
    \ “bitcoin”.\nThe blockchain network provides immutability, security, transparency,\
    \ and reliability.\nTherefore, the inherent characteristics of blockchain technology\
    \ are being recognized by\npractitioners for their implementation in different\
    \ sectors. The integration of blockchain\ntechnology with other domains helps\
    \ to overcome the privacy and security limitations\nby providing a tamper-proof\
    \ network system. For example, an intelligent transportation\nsystem heavily relies\
    \ on information sharing across multiple entities. The open-channel\ninformation\
    \ sharing presents several security issues, such as denial-of-service attack (DDoS),\n\
    man-in-the-middle attacks, etc. The application of blockchain technology can make\
    \ this\ninformation tamper-proof, transparent, and reliable. Similarly, it can\
    \ be applied to the\nInternet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV),\
    \ as well as to other domains\nwhere secure data transmission is required.\nIn\
    \ recent years, several studies, discussions, and projects regarding blockchain\
    \ have\nbeen recognized by researchers. The concept of blockchain is based on\
    \ distributed ledger\ntechnology (DLT), which delivers a radical change to the\
    \ existing trust model in order\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14073919\n\

    \ of 31\nto overcome the limitations of centralized systems, and which provides\
    \ an efﬁcient data-\ntrading mechanism. The conventional business processes are\
    \ highly dependent on cen-\ntralized systems (e.g., banks) to develop trust across\
    \ the participants [1,2]. However, the\ncentralized system always remains vulnerable\
    \ to multiple attacks. Researchers have pub-\nlished several studies with the\
    \ aim of mitigating the artiﬁcial alterations to the system using\nblockchain.\
    \ The blockchain architecture that is based on trust is proposed by researchers\
    \ to\nprevent security attacks, including Sybil, DDoS, and MAC layer attacks [3].\
    \ The challenge\nof security is one of the key areas of research in the realm\
    \ of blockchain and its applications.\nBusiness operations and activities can\
    \ be made secure, transparent, and immutable by\nusing the emerging blockchain\
    \ technology. The immutable, decentralized, and distributed\ncharacteristics of\
    \ blockchain also bring innovation to other technologies as composite uses\nof\
    \ DLT [4].\nBlockchain is considered to be a connected chain of sequential blocks.\
    \ Each individual\nblock represents the record of a digital transaction that is\
    \ secured using cryptographic\ntechniques. A peer-to-peer network (P2P) assists\
    \ in creating the blocks, along with their\nvalidation, and the consensus is achieved\
    \ by having majority votes in a blockchain network.\nThis method provides a transparent,\
    \ secure, and trustworthy model of blockchain where\nthe transactions between\
    \ the nodes are concerned. DLT has emerged to automate business\nprocesses and\
    \ operations without depending on a centralized third party [1,4]. The smart\n\
    implementation of blockchain in healthcare is also gaining attention for the achievement\
    \ of\na decentralized system for remote patient monitoring [5], tamper-proof patient-data-storage\n\
    management [6], and to preserve privacy in the healthcare sector [7]. Practitioners\
    \ have\nalso implemented the concepts of blockchain in various domains to omit\
    \ the centralized\nsystems by using distributed systems, such as in trade ﬁnance\
    \ [8], healthcare, electronic\nvoting [9], farming, and the insurance sector [10,11],\
    \ in order to depict the signiﬁcance\nof blockchain.\nThe vehicular ad hoc network\
    \ (VANET) is one of the major components of intelligent\ntransportation systems\
    \ (ITSs). Therefore, the current research always takes care of VANETs\nin realm\
    \ of intelligent transportation systems. The smart implementation of VANETs is\n\
    imperative, and it offers several advantages for different industries. For example,\
    \ oil\nmarketing companies (OMCs) are eager to have a digitalized system to keep\
    \ tabs on\ntheir ﬂeets and drivers, along with the product movement. Similarly,\
    \ logistics companies\nneed to have an intelligent transportation system to minimize\
    \ delays and maximize the\nperformance of deliveries. The smart implementation\
    \ of VANETs has the potential to take\ncare of the needs of today’s industries.\
    \ The further applications of VANETs, with respect\nto the current era, are supply\
    \ chain management, solid waste management, autonomous\ntransportation, etc. The\
    \ further detailed applications are discussed later in this review.\nVANETs have\
    \ gained signiﬁcant importance in research areas since the last decade\nbecause\
    \ of their distinctive characteristics, such as mobility, advance topology, and\
    \ wireless\nconnected vehicular technology. VANETs are being recognized by both\
    \ the industry and\nacademia for their implementation on larger scales [12]. In\
    \ the VANETs, the communication\nacross vehicles and the monitoring ofﬁce plays\
    \ a signiﬁcant role. The objective of the\ndynamic vehicular network is to precisely\
    \ circulate the notiﬁcation of events, such as\nweather alerts, road blockages,\
    \ and accidents, as well as emergencies such as roll overs, etc.\nHowever, there\
    \ are limitations of the vehicular network for passing critical messages in\n\
    the speciﬁed radius under a dynamic vehicular environment because of the presence\
    \ of\nsuspicious vehicles. The security issues of the traditional vehicular network\
    \ are ultimately\nexposed. The research related to intelligent transportation\
    \ systems determines and classiﬁes\nthe attacks and threats related to VANETs\
    \ by period [13]. The malevolent node can transmit\nfalse information by disseminating\
    \ other important real-time messages. This malicious\nbehavior of nodes can result\
    \ in the loss of lives and assets. Thus, this is identiﬁed as the\ngreatest challenge\
    \ for the VANET. The decentralized architecture of VANETs is proposed in\nthis\
    \ review to preserve security and privacy.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n3 of\
    \ 31\nExtensive efforts have been applied to determine blockchain and their applications\n\
    across various domains. This study proceeds from technical discussions on the\
    \ feasibility of\nDLT-enabled IoT [14,15] applications [16], business processes,\
    \ and even security issues [17],\nas well as other domains [18]. The information\
    \ was gathered from 68 articles, including the\nimpact factor publishers, IEEE,\
    \ Springer, Elsevier, MDPI, and ACM, from 2016 to early 2022.\nThis study classiﬁes\
    \ articles on the basis of the evolution of blockchain from the early stages\n\
    until the present date. This study adopted methods to precisely outline the relationships\n\
    between the challenges and the applied techniques.\nThe contemporary literature\
    \ on blockchain applications in VANETs is diversiﬁed with\nrespect to particular\
    \ areas [19,20]. This study further highlights the signiﬁcant research areas\n\
    for practitioners with unorganized comprehensions of the article distribution.\
    \ The research\ngap is identiﬁed across earlier studies on blockchain in the realm\
    \ of VANETs because of the\nlack of peer-reviewed articles that could play signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in the extensive research. The\nﬁrst blockchain-enabled IoT literature\
    \ survey was performed in [20], which covered up to\n2016, with a peer-reviewed\
    \ process in which 18 use cases and 35 examples were found and\ndiscussed in detail\
    \ with regard to the blockchain-enabled IoT. The researchers contributed\nextensively\
    \ to the integration of the IoT with blockchain and suggest subsequent research\n\
    for the advancement of blockchain-enabled IoT applications.\nThis review culminates\
    \ in the integration of blockchain and the IoT for a particular\ndomain of VANETs,\
    \ with its practical implementation unlike those in the existing general\nreviews.\
    \ The articles on blockchain with other domains are rare, and there are hardly\
    \ any\navailable before 2019. Therefore, the earlier research studies are not\
    \ sufﬁcient to provide a\nprecise overview of the integration. Therefore, an extensive\
    \ literature review is targeted\nin this study because of the agile evolution\
    \ of the IoT and the related domains, such as\nblockchain for the IoV and VANETs.\n\
    The existing literature on blockchain-enabled VANETs mainly focuses on the iden-\n\
    tiﬁcation of the use cases, methods, and the safety and security aspects of intelligent\n\
    transportation systems. However, this study is not only limited to the classiﬁcation\
    \ of\nstudies with respect to use cases, privacy, and security, but it also provides\
    \ a collaborative\ndecentralized architecture for VANETs. The proposed blockchain-enabled\
    \ architecture\nhelps to achieve the efﬁcient collaboration of entities, such\
    \ as vehicles, RSUs, and cloud-\nbased infrastructure, which is extended to the\
    \ composite use of the techniques, in contrast\nto the existing studies. This\
    \ study also places an emphasis on the identiﬁcation of the\nresearch domains\
    \ and methods for transportation industry and ﬂeet owners to maximize\ntheir throughputs\
    \ and improve their performances. For example, timely deliveries are\ncritical\
    \ for logistics, supply chain management, and oil marketing companies. Similarly,\n\
    in the healthcare sector, the timely arrival of ambulances and the movement of\
    \ medical\nequipment in pandemic-like situations is imperative. The major contributions\
    \ of this study\nare the classiﬁcations and compositions of the techniques, the\
    \ identiﬁcation of the research\nareas, and the provision of a blockchain-enabled\
    \ framework for a secure, transparent, and\ndecentralized network using the collaborative\
    \ efforts of the entities. The following table\n(Table 1) is used to provide a\

    \ with its unique characteristics,\nhas improved business operations [25,26],\
    \ immutability, and trust across the participating\nnodes. The integration of\
    \ the IoT and the IoV with blockchain is targeted to provide a\ndecentralized\
    \ architecture for VANETs. The comprehension of blockchain applications for\n\
    the IoV is also explored in order to ﬁll the research gap on the advance communication\n\
    networks across the Internet of Things.\nThe explicit questions proposed in this\
    \ study are related to identifying the needs and\nconnections between the existing\
    \ studies and the possibilities for future research.\nThe targeted research questions\
    \ that are answered in this review are as follows:\nRQ1: What are major research\
    \ areas when blockchain meets VANETs?\nRQ2: How is blockchain used to improve\
    \ VANETs through the employment of different re-\nsearch methodologies?\nRQ3:\
    \ What are the existing IoT and VANET challenges that can be addressed by employing\n\
    blockchain technology?\nRQ4: What are the limitations and challenges when blockchain\
    \ meets with multiple domains, and\nwhich techniques and models can be employed\
    \ to address these limitations?\nThe systematic literature review procedure was\
    \ adopted to classify the correlated\nissues that arise when blockchain meets\
    \ VANETs, and to answer the research questions\ncategorically. This study escalates\
    \ the categorization of blockchain-enabled applications\nby performing a systematic\
    \ review on modern studies. This study outlines the research\ngap between blockchain\
    \ and the IoT by employing a blockchain in VANETs. This paper\ncontributes towards\
    \ blockchain applications in the IoT, and especially in VANETs, through\nan extensive\
    \ analysis of the research articles. The several research areas and gaps are\n\
    Sustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n5 of 31\nhighlighted in the results of this literature\
    \ analysis for the prospective articles. The analysis\nof the literature review\
    \ is sorted as follows: Section 2 deﬁnes the backgrounds of the\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as DLT, blockchain, protocols/contracts, the IoT, the industrial IoT (IIoT),\n\
    machine-to-machine communication (M2M), and VANETs and their evolution towards\
    \ the\nIoV. Section 3 explains the procedure for conducting the review, the methodology,\
    \ and the\nprocedural steps. Sections 4–8 highlight the results, the descriptive\
    \ corpus, and the ﬁndings\nfrom the literature analysis. Section 9 presents a\
    \ discussion, and the review is concluded in\nSection 10.\n2. Background\n2.1.\
    \ Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)\nDLT has gained in popularity among researchers\
    \ since 2008, and it is being deployed\nin various sectors, for example, in ﬁnancial\
    \ services, energy, the supply chain, the IoT,\nthe IIoT, and VANETs. Blockchain\
    \ technology is based on DLT, which helps it to become\ndecentralized, rather\
    \ than having a centralized dependency. Blockchain enables organiza-\ntions to\
    \ eliminate trust and privacy issues by emphasizing security and privacy-preserving\n\
    techniques. Blockchain can also be referred to as “distributed databases” that\
    \ are managed\nto use an immutable hash tree that cannot be altered or modiﬁed\
    \ in order to ensure security.\nIn particular, the blocks represent records or\
    \ data transactions in the blockchain. Every\nblock has its own hash value, which\
    \ creates the links between the different blocks.\nThe role of DLT in blockchain-enabled\
    \ VANETs is critical to the achievement of efﬁcient\ndata trading across entities\
    \ such as vehicles, RSUs, and infrastructure. It facilitates the\navoidance of\
    \ the dependency of entities on third parties by having a distributed shared\n\
    ledger that consists of information such as trafﬁc, incidents, collisions, weather,\
    \ etc. The\nDLT also provides a trusted handshaking mechanism across the entities.\
    \ This is an inherent\ncharacteristic of blockchain that is used to avoid malicious\
    \ intrusion and to share data\nacross trusted entities. The decentralized architecture\
    \ of VANETs is proposed later in this\nstudy which is based on DLT, where entities,\
    \ such as vehicles, RSUs, and clouds, store the\nperceived information in the\
    \ form of a shared ledger. Similarly, Section 2.7. supports the use\nof DLT in\
    \ blockchain-enabled VANETs by means of vehicle-to-everything communication.\n\
    The blockchain offers a variety of features for security and a distributed architecture\n\
    that can be used for contact tracing. A consensus mechanism is important to achieving\n\
    the integrity and consistency of the transactions within a chain. The common consensus\n\
    mechanisms are proof of work (POW), proof of stake, and the direct acyclic graph.\
    \ Bitcoin\nuses proof of work as the consensus mechanism in order to compete with\
    \ computing\nresources. On the other hand, proof of stake is used for the coin’s\
    \ age competition rather\nthan the computing power. The expansion of POW in the\
    \ realm of blockchain-enabled\nVANETs is discussed later in this literature.\n\
    2.2. Blockchain\nThe analogy of blockchain is self-explanatory as it refers to\
    \ a sequential chain of blocks.\nThe individual block is responsible for holding\
    \ the information on the transactions as\nrecords and as the address of the succeeding\
    \ block. The header and the data of each block\nare encoded using a hashing mechanism\
    \ to ensure the data integrity. Similarly, the blocks\ncreate a network that consists\
    \ of participating nodes that are responsible for the transactions.\nEach participating\
    \ node of the blockchain network copies the chain in its storage in order\nto\
    \ have a complete digital ledger. The concept of blockchain is similar to Google\
    \ spread\nsheets, where a document is distributed across multiple participants,\
    \ and a trail record is\nmaintained with respect to the changes.\nThere are three\
    \ major types of blockchain: public, private, and federated blockchain.\nThe public,\
    \ or the permission less, blockchain is used where the participants are free to\n\
    participate in the consensus mechanism and to avail the beneﬁts accordingly. On\
    \ the other\nhand, the private, or permissioned, blockchain is used for a small\
    \ number of participants,\nwhere only the veriﬁed participants can participate\
    \ in the consensus. The federated, or\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n6 of 31\n\
    consortium, blockchain inherits the properties of both the public and private\
    \ blockchain,\nand it has therefore gained accordingly in popularity among researchers.\n\
    In ref. [27], Nakamoto proposes the decentralized system for digital currency\
    \ known as\n“bitcoin”. The idea of decentralization provides a mechanism for performing\
    \ transactions\nand exchanging messages without depending on third parties or\
    \ central authorities. The\nproposed architecture eliminates the single point\
    \ of the failure mechanism associated\nwith traditional centralized systems. Blockchain\
    \ is based on DLT and consists of growing\nsequential blocks. The individual block\
    \ not only holds the transactional information, but it\nalso stores the link of\
    \ the successive block [28]. The participating nodes also hold the copy\nof the\
    \ chain consisting of the transactional information, known as “the ledger”, with\
    \ mutual\ncoordination in a network. The DLT provides a trustless mechanism without\
    \ relying heavily\non traditional centralized systems. The P2P network builds\
    \ trust among the participating\nnodes in a network having a shared ledger.\n\
    In the IoT context, the decentralized system and schemes may provide a baseline\n\
    of trust without relying on centralized systems [29]. However, the blockchain\
    \ could\nfurther communicate between the IoT nodes in order to improve traceability\
    \ and message\npassing [30]. This further automates the operations and the communication\
    \ across the\nsensors, actuators, and devices in the realm of the IoT. There are\
    \ different variants of\nblockchain that can be applied in particular areas of\
    \ the IoT in order to achieve this\ndecentralized tendency.\n2.3. Smart Contracts\n\
    A “smart contract” is also referred to as “an agreement between the participating\
    \ nodes\nto complete the transactions” [31]. Sabzo proposed this concept in 1996,\
    \ which is deﬁned\nas the “computerized agreement between nodes to perform transactions”.\
    \ This mechanism\nbuilds trust among the nodes on the basis of certain conditions\
    \ outlined in the contract to\nact accordingly [32]. The immutability in the blockchain\
    \ and the smart contracts outperform\nthe traditional contracts between the participants.\
    \ This helps to execute transactions by\neliminating the intermediaries by using\
    \ the permissioned blockchain [33]. Smart contracts\nare also referred to as “programmable\
    \ scripts”, which can be deployed across the blockchain\nnetwork with addresses\
    \ to execute the functionalities [34]. Smart contracts are important\nfor the\
    \ data-centric executions in a network, especially when the blockchain meets the\
    \ IoT\nand other particular domains.\nBlockchain-enabled applications can reap\
    \ beneﬁts with the deployment of smart\ncontracts. The rules and regulations can\
    \ be deﬁned for communication across the IoT\nobjects. The blockchain network\
    \ helps to transfer the contract to each participating node.\nThe execution of\
    \ the contract is triggered when a certain condition in the network is met [35].\n\
    This mechanism also eliminates the interference of other entities [36].\nThe emerging\
    \ DLT is also being opted by well-known organizations, such as Maersk\nand IBM.\
    \ They recently announced the adoption of blockchain technology for commercial\n\
    pilot projects in order to achieve the smooth tracking of shipments, ﬁnance trading,\
    \ and\nthe automation of their other business operations. By using smart contracts,\
    \ the traditional\nmanual commercial processes can be eliminated [37]. Blockchain\
    \ that uses smart contracts\nreduce intermediaries and the costs incurred for\
    \ transactions, and they further improve\ntrading and the automation of business\
    \ operations.\nThe challenges of contracts, such as transaction ordering, contract\
    \ vulnerabilities, and\ncall stacks, are recognized by practitioners as open issues\
    \ for future research. The validation\nand veriﬁcation issues were also highlighted\
    \ by Vaidya in 2020. These issues need to be\naddressed when the integration of\
    \ blockchain with other domains is considered [38].\nHowever, this mechanism still\
    \ requires a systematic approach and mechanism in order to\naddress the challenges\
    \ and limitations.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n7 of 31\n2.4. Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT)\nThe blockchain and IoT technologies are being considered as the technologies\
    \ of the\nnext generation, or of the information era. The current research highlights\
    \ that 75 bil-\nlion objects, including industrial devices, will be connected\
    \ by 2026. On the other hand,\nthe limitations and challenges of IoT device handshaking,\
    \ connectivity, security, data\ntransmission, and storage are important and need\
    \ to be addressed; the IoT network will\ncollapse if is not able to obtain a stable\
    \ platform. However, blockchain technology is\ngaining major attention from researchers\
    \ for the achievement of state-of-the-art access\ncontrol schemes using blockchain,\
    \ such as the attribute-based access control scheme for\nsecurity, privacy, and\
    \ decentralization [39], and the data privacy and security mechanism\nfor IoT-enabled\
    \ devices [40].\nThe growing blockchain technology has a long way to go in terms\
    \ of other technologies,\nsuch as artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, the\
    \ IoT, and the data sciences. In the past\nfew years, an escalation in the research,\
    \ discussions, and projects with regard to the IoT\nhas gained the attention of\
    \ practitioners. The implementation of the IoT and the particular\nsubdomains\
    \ is being applied in the different industrial sectors mentioned in Figure 1.\n\
    The concept of the IoT is based on connecting things that deliver radical change\
    \ to the\nnetwork model of trust between the nodes or devices to solve the pain\
    \ points of the human–\nmachine or M2M interfaces. The traditional operations\
    \ rely heavily on the recording of\nmanual data to promote trust among the nodes.\
    \ However, the manual processes often\nlead to victimization in the forms of suspicious\
    \ attacks and intentional modiﬁcations.\nThe evolution of the IoT and its extensive\
    \ applications require a rethinking of the design\nand architecture.\nFigure 1.\
    \ An overview of the IoT.\nThe advanced implementation of the IoT in the industrial\
    \ sector is also referred to as\nthe industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where\
    \ things are connected to wireless networks\nfor data gathering and sharing. The\
    \ IIoT has gained signiﬁcant importance in different\nsectors and industries.\
    \ The IIoT devices are also referred to as “actuators”, “sensors”, and\n“electronic\
    \ chips”. The IIoT works in a fashion in which things or sensors gather information\n\
    from their surroundings, communicate with each other, and transmit over the air\
    \ by using\nGSM/GPRS/LTE to drive meaningful information. There can be various\
    \ applications of the\nIoT, e.g., home automation, ﬂeet telematics, fuel chains,\
    \ weather broadcasting, agriculture,\ngeneral supply chains, etc. The industrial\
    \ implementation of IoT devices automates and\nreinforces manufacturing, production,\
    \ and industrial operations.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n8 of 31\nThere are\
    \ many applications of the IoT, or the IIoT, such as home automation, the\nInternet\
    \ of Vehicles, ﬂeet telematics, fuel telematics, digital card-based e-healthcare\
    \ sys-\ntems [41], smart car parking, etc. The IoT implementation in the industrial\
    \ sector has led\nto the automation of the business operations and activities\
    \ [21]. An overview of IIoT- and\nIndustry-4.0-based applications is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 2, which depicts the evolutions\nof the robotics, electronics, electricity,\
    \ and mass production industries by the advanced\nimplementation of the IoT.\n\
    Figure 2. An overview of Industry 4.0 (mechanization, electricity, electronics,\
    \ and the IoT).\nThe targets and estimates reveal that billions of devices will\
    \ be connected in the coming\nyears. The limitations and challenges of connectivity,\
    \ security, and the cost of things in\nthe IoT are the important factors for practitioners\
    \ to consider when deploying blockchain\ntechnology in the IoT. MachNation forecasts\
    \ that 75 billion devices will be connected by\n2026, and that this will be directly\
    \ proportional to the revenue, with an annual growth rate\nof 15%. The existing\
    \ IoT solutions rely heavily on centralized management systems, but\nthey will\
    \ collapse when there are 75,000 billion devices wired for simultaneous connectivity.\n\
    Therefore, decentralized architecture is required for the stability and scalability\
    \ of IoT\napplications.\nThe IIoT infrastructure is designed in such a way that\
    \ the actuators or sensors gather\ndata from the surroundings and transmit it\
    \ to the edge gateway in order to transit the raw\ndata to the cloud, which further\
    \ performs data-processing activities and derives meaningful\ninformation, as\
    \ is illustrated in Figure 3.\n2.5. Machine-to-Machine Communication (M2M)\nM2M\
    \ communication refers to technology that supports the data transmission and\n\
    interaction of devices. This communication eliminates the human intervention in\
    \ IIoT ap-\nplications. M2M communication connects things, such as sensors, actuators,\
    \ and objects, in\norder to gather information and transmit accordingly [42].\
    \ M2M communication provides\na dynamic resource-sharing mechanism that allows\
    \ IoT entities to share resources with\neach other by using artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI), deep learning (DL), etc. It also provides\nadvanced architecture for the\
    \ smart communication of IoT devices with each other [43].\nThe ultramodern architecture\
    \ is elaborated in Figure 4.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n9 of 31\nFigure 3.\
    \ IIoT infrastructure and process diagram.\nFigure 4. M2M communication and architecture.\n\
    2.6. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs)\nVANETs introduce the network of self-organizing\
    \ vehicles that act as mobile nodes.\nThey conﬁne the communication between vehicles\
    \ and roadside units as V2V and V2R.\nThey assists drivers in avoiding collisions,\
    \ in picking the shortest route on the basis of\ntrafﬁc optimization, in identifying\
    \ tolls and the nearest fuel stations, and in enhancing\nthe safety of assets\
    \ and lives [44]. They facilitate the communication of vehicles across\nthe network\
    \ for real-time data transmission. They improve the road safety mechanism\nand\
    \ provide instant alerts or information in order to concern the authorities in\
    \ cases of\nemergency situations, such as roll overs, accidents, etc. The existing\
    \ architecture of VANETs\nalso exposes vulnerabilities, such as data snifﬁng,\
    \ impersonation, and ransomware attacks.\nThe applications related to VANETs are\
    \ usually designed for the assistance of drivers\nand for the safety of assets.\
    \ The emergency response system is studied in this review\nin order to enhance\
    \ the safety and to assist drivers in cases of emergencies, for example,\naccidents,\
    \ roll overs, ﬁres, object collisions, and similar incidents. Real-time audio/video\n\
    streaming is considered to be a major feature of surveillance applications, and\
    \ it can be used\nto investigate and identify the real causes of incidents. VANET\
    \ applications are time-critical\napplications because of the real-time transmission\
    \ of messages across each vehicle or station\nfor decision making.\n2.7. Internet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV)\nIn the nascent studies, the vehicle receives environmental\
    \ data and roadside informa-\ntion via a VANET [45]. The VANETs are deﬁned as\
    \ the subtypes of mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs). The vehicles act like nodes\
    \ in the network. In the advanced stage, the VANET\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n\
    10 of 31\nevolves into the IoV, which promotes the interactions of vehicles with\
    \ each other, or with\nsurrounding units and humans. This phenomenon is similar\
    \ to the evolution of M2M\ncommunication to the IoT. VANETs provide communication\
    \ between vehicles, whereas the\nIoV connects the vehicles and humans within and\
    \ around the vehicles. The IoV aggregates\nthe actuators, vehicles, and other\
    \ IoT devices to create a network system [46]. Cellular\nnetworks have evolved\
    \ VANETs towards the IoV. Practitioners recognize the concept of\nthe Internet\
    \ of Vehicles because of its mobility through the use of GSM/LTE channels [47].\n\
    Figure 5 illustrates the communication architecture of VANETs in more detail.\n\
    Figure 5. VANET communication and architecture.\nIn recent years, practitioners\
    \ have been attracted to the growing technologies of the\nIoT. IoV, 5G, MQTT,\
    \ and M2M technologies are being considered for implementation in\ntime-critical\
    \ systems. Vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) are considered to be the future\n\
    of vehicular networks. VSNs not only ensure an unlimited power supply, but they\
    \ are\nalso endowed with low power consumption. Technological advancement has\
    \ made ﬂeet\nmanagement more efﬁcient. Still, there are a lot of issues for ﬂeet\
    \ managers to deal with\nwhen handling ﬂeet telematics. With the increases in\
    \ trafﬁc and air pollution, there is an\nimmense need for a secure and reliable\
    \ intelligent transportation system (ITS) in order to\nfacilitate ﬂeet managers\
    \ and drivers. The IoT sensors help by providing more awareness of\nthe surroundings\
    \ for the ITS. The vehicles are equipped with sensors for driver assistance,\n\
    and the trafﬁc lights and roadsides are mounted with cameras and sensors. Such\
    \ a complex\nsystem can be handled well by 5G technology [47,48].\nThe IoV further\
    \ facilitates the communication between human drivers and ﬂeet moni-\ntoring staff\
    \ for real-time decision making. The communication models in VANETs, such\nas\
    \ V2V, V2I, V2R, etc., demonstrate the blockchain-enabled authentication schemes\
    \ for\nVANETs [49]. The real-time communication of the Internet of Vehicles is\
    \ bifurcated into\nﬁve categories, which are presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6.\
    \ An overview of vehicle-to-everything communication.\nSustainability 2022, 14,\
    \ 3919\n11 of 31\n2.7.1. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication\nThe V2I\
    \ model supports the wireless communication across the RSUs and the support-\n\
    ing infrastructure.\n2.7.2. Vehicle-to-Roadside Unit (V2R) Communication\nThe\
    \ V2R communication model supports the wireless communication between vehicle\n\
    and the RSUs to transmit information along the servers or the supporting infrastructure.\n\
    2.7.3. Vehicle-to-Sensor (V2S) Communication\nV2S systems support the bi-directional\
    \ communication between different kinds of\nsensors and onboard terminals for\
    \ real-time insights. For example, the object detection\nsensors, the fuel level\
    \ probes, and the load sensors can be connected to the terminal to\nprovide accurate\
    \ fuel level and distance information between the objects to avoid collision.\n\
    2.7.4. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication\nThe V2V model supports the wireless\
    \ communication across vehicles for sharing\nlocation data, and it consists of\
    \ the speeds and coordinates. For example, V2V commu-\nnication can be helpful\
    \ in providing prior road blockage information to the respective\non-route vehicles.\n\
    2.7.5. Vehicle-to-Human (V2H) Communication\nThe V2H model supports mobility and\
    \ awareness for the nearest users, such as\npedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.\
    \ It further facilitates communication between the driver\nand the vehicle.\n\
    Cellular, or GSM/LTE/5G, technologies will make the above types of communication\n\
    more reliable in the context of future research with regard to intelligent transportation.\
    \ The\nblockchain-enabled reputation model is signiﬁcant among the communication\
    \ models. In\nreputation-enabled models, the provider reputation is validated\
    \ before the storing of its\ndata in the blockchain network [22]. The abovementioned\
    \ composite communication types\nare also called “vehicle-to-everything (V2X)”\
    \ communication.\n2.8. Event-Driven Service-Oriented Architecture (EDSOA) for\
    \ IoT\nService-oriented architecture (SOA) is used when there are heterogeneous\
    \ devices\nand systems. The IoT also deals with heterogeneous devices. These are\
    \ made by different\nmanufacturers and follow different communication protocols.\
    \ SOA provides technology\nand language independence. The further implementation\
    \ of SOA with respect to the\ndistributed systems has been evaluated by practitioners\
    \ for the proposal of event-driven\narchitecture. The EDSOA is being practiced\
    \ in the ﬁeld of the IoT to deal with real-time\ninformation. The request and\
    \ response modes are processed by the service in the event-\ndriven architecture\
    \ [50], as is mentioned in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. EDSOA service communication. Reprinted\
    \ with permission from ref. [50]. Copyright\nLan et al., 2015.\nIn traditional\
    \ systems, the client/server approach is used for data communication.\nThis process\
    \ is time-consuming since the client must wait for the server to respond. The\n\
    Sustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n12 of 31\ntraditional client/server approach has\
    \ limitations for IoT-based real-time applications, such\nas vehicle tracking,\
    \ router and journey management, and emergency response systems.\nThe EDSOA has\
    \ been analyzed by practitioners for VANETs for faster and more reliable\ncommunication\
    \ across things.\n3. Materials and Methods\nThe SLR was conducted according to\
    \ the proposed guidelines of Kitchenham in [51].\nThe following steps were performed\
    \ to answer the research questions: (1) Planning and\nconducting the review; (2)\
    \ Inclusion/exclusion criteria; (3) Abstract and article examination;\nand (4)\
    \ Results and descriptive analysis of the corpus.\n3.1. Planning and Conducting\
    \ the Review\nThis SLR was established to identify the relationship between the\
    \ blockchain and\nthe IoT towards the particular domain of VANETs. Since the emergence\
    \ of blockchain\ntechnology, research studies, and the related works, practices,\
    \ and standards related to\nblockchain, smart contracts, the IoT, and DLT are\
    \ unfolding. We selected a period of\nsix years (2016–2021 (extended to early\
    \ 2022)) from which to adopt the most recent research\nwork on blockchain-enabled\
    \ VANETs. This study followed the research guidelines provided\nby Kitchenham\
    \ in 2009 in [51] to develop the state-of-the-art replicable study. The articles\n\
    from impact factor journals were targeted to maintain the quality of this study.\
    \ We analyzed\nand explored the extant literatures on blockchain and VANETs. The\
    \ search was applied\non IEEE Xplore, Springer, Elsevier, MDPI, ACM, and Google\
    \ Scholar, using the following\nsearch strings:\n1.\n“Blockchain” <AND> “VANETS”;\n\
    2.\n“Blockchain” <AND> “VANETS” <OR> “IoV” <OR> “Internet of Vehicles”.\nThe step-by-step\
    \ procedure for the literature searching and screening is demonstrated\nin Figure\
    \ 8.\nFigure 8. Procedural steps for article assessment.\nSustainability 2022,\
    \ 14, 3919\n13 of 31\n3.2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\nThe inclusion and exclusion\
    \ criteria were established for the article assessment in\norder to extract highly\
    \ authentic and relevant literature. The foci of the research were\nbased on the\
    \ key words related to blockchain and the particular domain of VANETs. The\nkeywords,\
    \ “blockchain”, “VANETs”, “IoV”, and “Internet of Vehicles”, were included on\n\
    the basis of the research interests. A total of 146 articles were shortlisted\
    \ in the ﬁrst step of\nthe searching among the impact factor journals and Google\
    \ Scholar. A total of 18 articles\nwere eliminated because of duplication, and\
    \ the remaining 128 articles were selected for\nfurther analysis and examination.\n\
    3.3. Abstract and Article Assessment\nIn the screening step, a total 68 studies\
    \ were selected out of the 128 studies on the\nbasis of the abstract and literature\
    \ assessment. The articles that were less focused on the\ntargeted topics were\
    \ removed from the study. The selection of 68 studies was based purely\non the\
    \ relevant and concrete ﬁndings and contributions. We further veriﬁed our process\
    \ in\norder to maintain cohesion in the selection of articles. The quality was\
    \ considered at each\nstage, and, during the screening, a further 29 articles\
    \ were eliminated because they were\nnon-impactor publications. The databases\
    \ and research were further extended to early\n2022, and 29 more studies were\
    \ included after the assessment, as is presented in Figure 8.\nA total of 68 studies\
    \ were included in this literature after all of the steps: identiﬁcation,\nscreening,\
    \ eligibility, and extension.\n4. Results\nDescriptive Analysis of the Corpus\n\
    The 68 shortlisted studies are distributed in the form of graph with respect to\
    \ the\nperiod of six years. This distribution demonstrates the escalation of blockchain\
    \ technology\nover the years. The proliferation of blockchain technology also\
    \ enables other domains to\nintegrate and evolve. The evolution of blockchain\
    \ was started in 2008 and, at that time, the\nresearch was mainly focused on digital\
    \ currencies and the associated issues. Since 2016, it\nhas attracted practitioners\
    \ for the evolution of other domains. In particular, the evolution\nof blockchain\
    \ in VANETs is demonstrated by the spread graph of the articles in Figure 9.\n\
    Figure 9. Spread of articles by period.\nFigure 9 demonstrates the spread of the\
    \ articles by period, and it can be observed that\nthe graph of the studies increases\
    \ for blockchain-enabled VANETs over the period of time.\nA further count of the\

    2018\nIEEE\n5. RQ1: Blockchain Domains and Research Areas\nThe selected articles\
    \ were classiﬁed with respect to the research domains in order to\nanswer RQ1.\
    \ The classiﬁcation of the domains was achieved by giving consideration to the\n\
    implementation of blockchain technology in VANETs. The research focus was to determine\n\
    the corresponding ﬁelds when the blockchain meets VANETs, including the individual\n\
    entities. The classiﬁcation is demonstrated with the help of the pie chart presented\
    \ in\nFigure 10.\nFigure 10. Classiﬁcation of studies for blockchain-enabled VANETs.\n\
    Figure 10 highlights that 51% of the selected studies are related to blockchain\
    \ and\nVANETs. The graph of the results emphasizes the advancement of blockchain\
    \ technology\nin the realm of VANETs. The literature analysis conﬁrms that researchers\
    \ and practitioners\nare focusing on these technologies. In particular, the studies\
    \ indicate the resolutions\nfor the vehicle ad hoc network issues and challenges\
    \ through the employment of DLT.\nFigure 10 also represents the general and particular\
    \ areas when blockchain is integrated\nwith VANETs. The areas of blockchain, the\
    \ Internet of Vehicles, VANETs, named data\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n17\
    \ of 31\nnetworking (NDN), video stream networks (VSNs), the IoT, V2I, and Fog\
    \ Computing\nare the signiﬁcant literature ﬁndings. The NDN is considered to be\
    \ a future Internet\narchitecture, similar to an IP address, in which the data\
    \ names are used for the packet\nforwarding. NDN is in its earlier stages, and\
    \ it can therefore be considered for future\nresearch in blockchain-enabled VANETs.\
    \ Similarly, VSNs are used for multimedia sharing\nacross entities, and blockchain\
    \ can be applied to VSNs for data integrity and security over\nthe air. Later\
    \ in this section, the implementations of the other areas are discussed in detail.\n\
    6. RQ2: Blockchain Framework for VANETs\nThe blockchain-based research methodologies\
    \ and techniques were determined from\nthe selected articles to answer RQ2. The\
    \ highlighted blockchain techniques can be employed\nto improve VANETs. There\
    \ are 10 techniques that are examined in detail and illustrated in\nFigure 11,\
    \ and the rest of the techniques are mentioned as “other”. Figure 12 segregates\
    \ the\nnumbers of studies with regard to the techniques in order to demonstrate\
    \ the signiﬁcance\nof the studies against the techniques.\nIn Figure 11, the blockchain-based\
    \ techniques are illustrated, and these can be em-\nployed to obtain blockchain-enabled\
    \ VANETs. Blockchain-enabled frameworks [67], decen-\ntralized architectures,\
    \ and techniques based on cryptography are discussed in the majority\nof the selected\
    \ studies in relation to overcoming the integration of the blockchain and\nVANETs.\n\
    Figure 12 emphasizes the techniques of blockchain and their signiﬁcance can be\n\
    analyzed on the basis of the numbers of studies on them. Blockchain frameworks\
    \ and\ndecentralized authentication schemes are discussed in 24 aggregated studies\
    \ out of 68,\nwhich shows that blockchain frameworks are being employed in different\
    \ IoT sectors.\nConnected vehicles (CVs) are one of the most promising areas of\
    \ research in the realm\nof blockchain. Therefore, the framework for blockchain\
    \ and CVs is also studied in the\nmost recent research in order to understand\
    \ the dynamics [112]. Similarly, in this research\non VANETs, eight studies presented\
    \ innovative frameworks for integrating blockchain\nand VANETs.\nFigure 11. An\
    \ overview and classiﬁcation of blockchain techniques.\nSustainability 2022, 14,\
    \ 3919\n18 of 31\nFigure 12. Blockchain techniques and publications.\n6.1. Decentralized\
    \ Architecture for VANETs\nAs can be seen in Figure 12, the blockchain framework\
    \ and the decentralized au-\nthentication mechanism are discussed in a total of\
    \ 24 studies out of 68 shortlisted articles.\nFurthermore, the practically possible\
    \ decentralized architecture is discussed in only 3 stud-\nies out of 68. Therefore,\
    \ an advanced decentralized architecture is one of the most prominent\nneeds of\
    \ our time. The state of the architecture is determined thoroughly in this study\
    \ and\nis demonstrated in Figure 13.\nFigure 13. Decentralized architecture for\
    \ VANETs.\nThe identity and privacy of vehicles and their locations were analyzed\
    \ using the\nconstruction approach of the IoT chain architecture and private blockchain\
    \ [5,38] to obtain\na blockchain-based architecture for VANETs, as is shown in\
    \ Figure 13. The rectiﬁed and\nanalyzed architecture is based on eight different\
    \ components: vehicles, the roadside unit\n(RSU), the onboard unit (OBU), the\
    \ infrastructure, the blockchain network, the smart\ncontract, the miner, and\
    \ the agent node.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n19 of 31\n6.1.1. Vehicles\n\
    Vehicles are considered to be one of the essential moving components of blockchain-\n\
    enabled VANETs. The onboard units installed in vehicles help facilitate communication\n\
    with the core network.\n6.1.2. On-Board Unit\nThe OBU is also known as a tracking\
    \ device, or a data terminal, which is mounted on\nthe vehicle. This component\
    \ is responsible for the vehicle communication with servers or\nadjacent nodes.\n\
    6.1.3. Roadside Unit\nThe RSU is considered to be an access point in the network.\
    \ This unit is responsible\nfor collecting data from the OBUs and transmitting\
    \ it to the core network in real time. The\nRSU also transmits trafﬁc, emergency,\
    \ and weather-related information for the assistance\nof drivers and ﬂeet staff.\n\
    6.1.4. Core Network\nThe core network consists of several servers and ensures\
    \ connectivity with vehicles\nfor the data transmission through the RSU. The CA,\
    \ database, application, and web servers\nlie in the core network. All the data\
    \ stored on these servers is encrypted in order to conﬁrm\nthe data integrity\
    \ and security. The core network is responsible for maintaining all the\ncommunication\
    \ messages in real time for further decision making.\n6.1.5. Blockchain Network\n\
    This literature review analyzes the blockchain network with the aim of ensuring\n\
    privacy protection in the blockchain-based architecture for VANETs. The private\
    \ chain\narchitecture was examined, in which all the hash values are stored in\
    \ the network to avoid\nmalicious attacks. However, the data cannot be tampered\
    \ with or changed because the\nblockchain is immutable.\n6.1.6. Smart Contracts\n\
    The protocols (referred to as “contracts”) are clearly deﬁned for the authentication,\n\
    anonymity, data encoding and decoding, etc. The use of contracts also helps to\
    \ save\ntransaction costs.\n6.1.7. Agent Node\nThe participant is considered to\
    \ be an agent node in a decentralized network. The\nparticipants participate in\
    \ a consensus mechanism and ensure the backup of the network.\nThe agent node\
    \ also provides correctness across transactions.\n6.1.8. Miner\nThe special agent\
    \ node is considered to be a miner node when it tries to solve the\nmathematical\
    \ problem and solves it successfully. The miner node solves the puzzle and\nobtains\
    \ the legal right to keep the block. The miner node is also responsible for the\
    \ mining\nand validating of new blocks. The updated data is saved in a newly established\
    \ block, and\nall of the other participants update the respective storage accordingly\
    \ in the blockchain.\nThe components of the blockchain-based framework for VANETs\
    \ are discussed above,\nand their interactions are demonstrated in Figure 14.\n\
    Sustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n20 of 31\nFigure 14. Blockchain-enabled VANET communication\
    \ architecture.\n7. RQ3: Blockchain and the IoT/VANET Challenges, Limitations,\
    \ and Techniques\nTo answer RQ3, Table 4 explains the methods, challenges and\
    \ limitations when\nblockchain integration takes place with VANETs. The advantages\
    \ and challenges of the tra-\nditional models are described as follows: The Bayesian\
    \ inference model [113] provides the\nmechanism for decentralized trust management\
    \ and ensures the consistency and reliability\nof the storage or database. The\
    \ composition of the trust management and privacy preserva-\ntion is one of the\
    \ major drawbacks of this methodology. The proof of work (POW) is used\nas a consensus\
    \ mechanism to validate the authentic and deserving nodes that have good\nreputations\
    \ and computing power. In our proposed architecture, the message exchange\nand\
    \ identiﬁcation of malicious nodes can be managed by using POW. The provision\
    \ of\ninformation sharing will only be available across vehicles or entities having\
    \ the capability\nto prove their worth by solving a puzzle. The POW [91] needs\
    \ further enhancement to\ndeal with the crucial event message dissemination in\
    \ dynamic topology in order to achieve\nlow computation and maximum throughput.\
    \ The proof of driving mechanism is also\nhighlighted by practitioners to mitigate\
    \ the issues of the POW and proof of stake. The\nconditional anonymity and improved\
    \ transparency are observed in the blockchain-based\nanonymous reputation system\
    \ (BARS) [114], but it is also vulnerable to various attacks. The\ncertiﬁcate\
    \ less public key signature (CL-PKS) [55] is recognized as one of the efﬁcient\
    \ meth-\nods for vehicle-to-infrastructure communication with lower computation\
    \ costs. However,\nit needs to be enhanced more for vehicle-to-vehicle communication.\
    \ The hierarchical tem-\nporal memory (HTM) method [115] was found to be effective\
    \ and efﬁcient for identifying\nmalicious users, but the challenge of battling\
    \ frequent attacks persists for this methodology.\nSimilarly, the implementation\
    \ of an improved growing hierarchical self-organizing map\n(I-GHSOM) is critically\
    \ important to achieving intrusion detection functionality. It can\nbe used in\
    \ the proposed decentralized architecture as a composite mechanism to handle\n\
    the large number of vehicles in dynamic topology, and to intercept intrusions\
    \ accordingly\nfor faster and more secure message transmission. The I-GHSOM [116]\
    \ is quick compared\nto other methods for detecting multiple types of attacks.\
    \ The message-by-vehicle can be\nmined quickly by using this method. However,\
    \ it needs to be improved in terms of the\nmanagement of the overheads. The better\
    \ effectiveness and enhanced data transmission\nwere analyzed under the methodology\
    \ of uniﬁed trust management, but this lacks security\nbecause of virtualization\
    \ and software-deﬁned networks [117] Lastly, the methodology of\nblockchain-based\
    \ VANETs [9] was analyzed and was recognized as having one of the most\neffective\
    \ data processing times, as well as privacy protection. Earlier, this methodology\n\
    depended on trusted centralized entities, but the advancement of blockchain has\
    \ made it\ndecentralized and distributed. However, this methodology is regarded\
    \ as the most useful\nfor when blockchain meets VANETs.\nSustainability 2022,\

    \ to overcome the challenges. The research focus is to ﬁll the research gap in\

    \ an immense amount of atten-\ntion from researchers and practitioners in the\
    \ last decade. The escalation and implementa-\ntions of blockchain with IoT are\
    \ being experimented on as pilot projects in various sectors.\nThe DLT has achieved\
    \ both theoretical and practical endorsements from the academic and\nindustrial\
    \ perspectives. The classiﬁcations of the studies with respect to the theoretical,\n\
    simulation, and experiment-based results are presented in Figure 16. There are\
    \ 32 studies\nout of 68 that are based on theoretical analyses, 23 studies that\
    \ are based on simulation\nresults, and only 13 studies that are based on experimental\
    \ results. Figure 16 highlights the\nsigniﬁcance of the practical implementation\
    \ as future research for the practitioners.\nFigure 16. Result-wise classiﬁcation\
    \ of studies.\nThe research questions are answered in this review to determine\
    \ the future directions\nof blockchain technology in the particular domain of\
    \ VANETs. There is a research gap\nbetween blockchain and its applications, and\
    \ particularly for vehicular networks. The\nmajor research issues for integrating\
    \ blockchain and VANETs are security, traceability,\nand transparency. The major\
    \ implementation of VANETs is in the digitalization of ﬂeet\ntelematics. Further\
    \ details with regard to the issues and implementations are presented in\nthe\
    \ following sections.\n9.1. Security, Traceability, and Transparency\nThe traceability,\
    \ security, and transparency are always challenges for VANETs and\nother related\
    \ technologies. These challenges arise when handshaking protocols are required\n\
    Sustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n25 of 31\nfor better hand-offs in centralized architecture.\
    \ The DLT can be applied in VANETs because\nof the immense number of characteristics\
    \ for overcoming such challenges of security. It also\nprovides trust and consensus\
    \ mechanisms to increase the reliability and traceability. The\nledger is shared\
    \ among the nodes to prevent the loss of data integrity. The major players\nat\
    \ the sensory layer, including the actuators, gateways, routers, and things, have\
    \ shared\nledgers to permit access on a per need basis for the process ﬂows. The\
    \ blockchain, with\nan immense number of features and advantages, eliminates the\
    \ centralized systems and\npromotes immutable, transparent, and efﬁcient architecture\
    \ for other domains.\n9.2. IoV and Fleet Management Digitalization\nThe VANETs\
    \ and the corresponding technologies are critical for ITS. This is a network\n\
    of connected vehicles. The connection modes are facilitated through satellite\
    \ (GPS) or\ncellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G), and this depends on the onboard unit\
    \ (OBU) embedded\ninside the vehicle. Some OBUs provide multiple modes of connection\
    \ in order to provide\nreliability and coverage. RFID technology can provide each\
    \ driver with a unique digital\nidentity. Remote ﬂeet managers can track the driver’s\
    \ performance, and provide warnings\nfor bad performances and rewards for good\
    \ performances, which can boost the driver’s\nmotivation to perform well on the\
    \ road. Fleet management systems, such as food delivery\nﬂeet management, taxi\
    \ ﬂeet management, oil distribution ﬂeet management, etc., can beneﬁt\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ from the implementation of blockchain-enabled VANETs. The surveillance\ncameras\
    \ can also be attached to the OBU for vehicle surveillance for the ﬂeet managers.\n\
    Parameters, such as the engine speed, the tank temperature, the tire pressure,\
    \ and the fuel\nconsumption can be monitored through sensors and can be controlled\
    \ remotely for vehicle\nsafety control. Figure 17 illustrates VANETs and their\
    \ applications in ﬂeet management.\nFigure 17. An overview of ﬂeet management\
    \ system and its components.\n9.3. Blockchain-Enabled VANET Applications\nThe\
    \ research implication of blockchain-enabled IoT was found suitable for the areas\n\
    described in the following sections, where its immediate implementation can completely\n\
    change the perspective.\n9.3.1. Fleet and Journey Management for ITS\nThe efﬁcient\
    \ movement of vehicles with containers is always challenging for ﬂeet\nowners.\
    \ Blockchain-enabled VANETs can help ﬂeet owners track their ﬂeets in real time\n\
    by preserving the coordinates, speeds, altitudes, angles, temperatures, and fuel\
    \ levels\nusing a real-time messaging system. In general supply chains and fuel\
    \ supply chains,\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n26 of 31\nblockchain promote\
    \ trust among all the authorities, and it also enables the quick and\nefﬁcient\
    \ movement of products with greater consensus.\n9.3.2. Asset Tracking\nThe compliance\
    \ with safety and security is always a challenge for authorities when\nthey are\
    \ attempting to ensure efﬁcient asset movement. The blockchain-enabled VANETs\n\
    can help to store data in shared ledgers throughout the product’s lifecycle. The\
    \ ledger\ninformation can be shared with the concerned authorities, consignees,\
    \ manufacturers, and\nshippers. The blockchain technology in asset management\
    \ is easy to implement, secure,\nand transparent, with the cutting-edge feature\
    \ of cost-effectiveness.\n9.3.3. Data Science and Management\nData science and\
    \ management applications can be developed on blockchain technology\nto ensure\
    \ tamper-free maintenance and operational data. This helps to maintain the data\n\
    integrity in data sciences to prevent prediction anomalies. The trusted ledger\
    \ of the\ndata changes can also be shared with the appropriate authorities for\
    \ further compliance\nand management.\n9.3.4. Solid Waste Management\nResearchers\
    \ have surveyed blockchain-and-VANET-based waste management models\nfor the advancement\
    \ of waste collection procedures in developing cities. The key compo-\nnents of\
    \ waste management models are waste collection, truck routing, transportation,\
    \ and\nthe monitoring of the recycling of certain types of garbage. Researchers\
    \ propose intelligent\nalgorithms for the collection, disposal, and recycling\
    \ of trash.\n9.3.5. Contact Tracing and Social Distancing\nThe only way to prevent\
    \ pandemics is to maintain social distancing. The decentral-\nized model of contact\
    \ tracing is endorsed by an international consortium, which consists\nof Google\
    \ and Apple, in order to ensure transparency and privacy. Researchers have\nsurveyed\
    \ blockchain- and IoT-enabled techniques for contact tracing to preserve privacy,\n\
    transparency, and security. The analyzed composition of blockchain and IoV can\
    \ provide\ndigital contact tracing mechanisms for the prevention of pandemics\
    \ such as COVID-19.\n10. Conclusions\nThis study encapsulates a systematic review\
    \ and analysis that is based on multidis-\nciplinary research studies, and that\
    \ addresses the issues that can occur when blockchain\nmeets the IoT, and especially\
    \ VANETs. It further provides a comprehensive classiﬁcation of\nthe articles on\
    \ the basis of the methods and techniques used to overcome the challenges of\n\
    VANETs. The complete decentralized architecture of VANETs is derived from the\
    \ extensive\nliterature review and is referred to as “blockchain-enabled VANET\
    \ architecture”.\nThe substantial contribution of this review is that it highlights\
    \ the signiﬁcance of\nblockchain in other domains with the inherent characteristics.\
    \ The particular area of\nVANETs was selected in this review in order to validate\
    \ the potentials of blockchain\ntechnology. The decentralized architecture was\
    \ also derived for vehicular networks on the\nbasis of DLT. The speciﬁc mechanisms\
    \ of VANETs, as well as the IoT, such as handshaking,\nhand-offs, and data communication,\
    \ are also discussed in the light of blockchain technology.\nThe challenges, limitations,\
    \ and open issues of blockchain-enabled applications are\nalso classiﬁed for future\
    \ prospects. This study is not only limited to the integration of\nblockchain\
    \ and VANETs, but it also discusses the potential blockchain issues that may be\n\
    addressed in future research. The interoperability, scalability, and storage-related\
    \ technical\nissues still need to be addressed by practitioners. Lastly, this\
    \ study also provides a classiﬁca-\ntion of the articles that is based on the\
    \ result types, such as the theoretical, simulation, and\nexperimental results.\
    \ This classiﬁcation highlights that blockchain-enabled pilot projects\nare rare.\
    \ Therefore, practical implementation should be considered by practitioners for\
    \ a\nSustainability 2022, 14, 3919\n27 of 31\nmore concrete implementation of\
    \ blockchain in different domains. This study also sheds\nlight on an overview\
    \ of the extant blockchain-enabled IoT chain research as future works.\nAs part\
    \ of the future work, research can commence on 5G-enabled blockchain-based\nVANETs\
    \ using narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) technologies for high mobility and latency, and\n\
    low power consumption. This study could also lead to the implementation of blockchain\n\
    in different sectors, such as blockchain-enabled healthcare transportation for\
    \ door-to-door\nvaccination, which can be targeted to handle pandemic-like situations.\
    \ The future implica-\ntions of this study could also be helpful for contact tracing\
    \ and isolation management in the\nrealm of the IoT. The proposed decentralized\
    \ architecture can also be extended to the design\nof state-of-the-art journey\
    \ management systems for autonomous vehicles and drones.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: Geothermal energy installations are becoming increasingly common in
    new city develop-

    ments and renovations. With a broad range of technological applications and improvements
    in this

    ﬁeld, the demand for suitable monitoring technologies and control processes for
    geothermal energy

    installations is also growing. This article identiﬁes opportunities for the future
    development and

    deployment of IoT sensors applied to geothermal energy installations. The ﬁrst

    technologies

    and edge computing methods are also reviewed. The survey concludes with a discussion
    of research

    challenges and an outline of new areas of application for monitoring geothermal
    installations and

    1. Introduction

    Geothermal energy is characterized by two types, one with high enthalpy and the
    other

    with low enthalpy. High-enthalpy energy is found in speciﬁc regions and rock masses
    that

    contain high temperatures and high heat potential, especially volcanic areas and
    deep faults.

    High-enthalpy energy is used for power and heat generation, while low-enthalpy
    energy is

    used only for heat generation and can be found in most shallow rock mass zones
    around

    the world. Underground geothermal structures have been used for various applications,

    for example, electricity production or district heating. Heat pumps for geothermal
    applica-

    tions and geothermal plants produce both electricity and hot water for district
    heating. To

    provide the data required for the proper functioning and control of systems, it
    is necessary

    to monitor various parameters within speciﬁc volumes of rock [1]. Monitoring the
    condi-

    tions of the rock environment provides the information required to manage and
    control

    processes to prolong the lifetimes of systems and avoid outages in operating underground

    geothermal structures [2]. To control a geothermal system, the key monitoring
    parameters

    are the ﬂuid temperature, ambient rock environment temperature, volumetric ﬂow
    rate,

    and physical characteristics of underground structures; minor monitoring parameters
    in-

    clude scale formation [3] and slope movement [4]. Monitoring the speciﬁc characteristics

    and behaviors of underground structures assists in detecting problems and failures
    that

    prevent optimal system operation and energy management. The monitoring focus for

    an underground geothermal structure is dependent on the geothermal application
    area,

    examples of which include heat pumps [5], mines or wells [6], pipelines [7], reservoirs
    [8]

    and borehole exchangers [9].

    Monitoring aims to determine or continuously update the status of key parameters

    necessary for the proper operation of an underground geothermal structure. To
    monitor

    these parameters, devices such as those connected to the Internet of Things (IoT)
    can be

    used. These devices must be able to monitor several variables and wirelessly transmit

    measured values to the cloud [10].

    IoT technology is widely used and can also be applied to many areas of monitoring

    underground geothermal structures. This type of technology is especially useful
    in loca-

    tions where wireless communications are required. These areas are generally difﬁcult
    or

    impossible to connect to a power grid, and therefore, alternative power sources
    such as

    batteries or energy harvesting methods are necessary [11]. In this case, monitoring
    devices

    must consume low amounts of energy, and suitable technologies with powering constraints,

    for example, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology, are therefore required.

    LPWAN technology was designed for reliable wireless data transmission with minimal

    power consumption. The commonly used LPWAN technologies include LoRaWAN, Sigfox

    and NB-IoT [12].

    Table 1 lists recently published reviews of monitoring performed in speciﬁc under-

    ground geothermal structures. The listed studies examined a variety of systems
    that

    monitor different parameters, are deployed in speciﬁc types of geothermal structures
    and

    employ IoT technology. In Refs. [13–15], the authors discussed temperature monitoring

    and the temperature measurement methods, sensors and tools suitable for geothermal
    ap-

    plications, such as vertical borehole heat exchangers, downholes and power plant
    devices.

    In Ref. [1,2], the authors discussed ﬂow rate sensing techniques, providing comprehen-

    sive descriptions and comparisons of the two-phase ﬂow monitoring methods applied

    in geothermal pipelines and geothermal wells. In addition to monitoring temperature

    and ﬂow parameters, geothermal applications also use sensors to monitor mechanical

    parameters, such as scale formation [3] and slope movement [4]. In Ref. [4], the
    authors

    provided an overview of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) combined with IoT devices
    for

    monitoring slopes. The monitoring of other mechanical parameters has not yet been
    sum-

    marized in any recently published survey. The authors of [7,9] discussed the use
    of WSNs

    in underground coal mine monitoring systems and methods for monitoring leakage
    and

    sinkholes. The motivation for the current review is the lack of comprehensive
    studies on IoT

    applications for monitoring underground geothermal structures. To our best knowledge,
    no

    reviews have summarized the use of IoT technology in relation to monitoring geothermal

    parameters, such as temperature, pressure, ﬂow rate and mechanical parameters.

    The main contributions of this article are:

    •

    ground geothermal structures and the currently available monitoring technologies

    and sensors;

    2. Sensor Technologies

    Sensors containing speciﬁc technologies are necessary for monitoring the subterranean

    environment of a geothermal structure. The ability to continuously monitor such
    structures

    at a reasonable cost is desirable in terms of improving efﬁciency and allowing
    the immediate

    detection of problems and faults [2]. This section examines the technologies for
    measuring

    temperature, ﬂow rate and other mechanical parameters, such as pressure and slope

    movement, in these speciﬁc environments.

    2.1. Temperature Measurement

    Temperature monitoring technologies enable the study of geological processes and

    the investigation of subsurface thermal properties. Table 2 lists some of the
    temperature

    measurement technologies applied in complex systems. The principles of these speciﬁc

    temperature measurement technologies are further described in this subsection.

    Depending on the installation method, temperature sensing technologies fall into
    two

    categories: static installations and mobile sensing. Static installation systems
    are ﬁxed

    and permanently installed. These systems include optical ﬁbres, distributed temperature

    sensing (DTS) technology, thermistors and thermocouples. Static installation sensors
    are

    used for temperature measurements in geothermal wells, downholes or borehole heat

    exchangers. Mobile sensing uses wireless technology and is not ﬁxed or permanently

    installed. Mobile sensing systems are used, for example, to monitor the temperature
    of

    geothermal ﬂuid in borehole heat exchangers.

    2.1.1. Static Installations

    Static installations deploy thermistors, thermocouples, ﬁbre optic thermometers
    or

    DTS technology. Thermistors are sensors capable of measuring high-quality temperature–

    depth information from boreholes up to 100 m or more below the Earth’s surface
    [19].

    Thermocouples are installed to measure temperatures at the inlets and outlets
    of geothermal

    heat exchangers [20]. Wired optical sensors provide continuous measurements with
    high-

    resolution temperature proﬁles along pipelines [18] and are often attached to
    the outer

    surface of the pipe wall or located within the underground structure itself [21].

    DTS technology is used for temperature measurements along various types of under-

    ground geothermal structures. Measurements are based on detecting light from Rayleigh,

    Raman or Brillouin backscattering phenomena [15]. DTS technology measures tempera-

    tures using optical ﬁbres that provide a continuous temperature distribution proﬁle
    of the

    entire cable [22]. This method is able to achieve highly accurate temperature
    measurements

    over long distances, up to 30 km. This technology is very sensitive for monitoring
    temper-

    ature, as it is characterized by a spatial resolution of 1 m at an accuracy of
    ±1 ◦C and a

    resolution of 0.01 ◦C [23]. This technology works by detecting thermal changes
    along the

    optical ﬁbre that manifest as molecular or lattice vibrations in the material.
    In addition,

    thermal changes cause local changes in the refractive index. Changes in the refractive
    index

    are then manifested as the inelastic scattering of transmitted light. Molecular
    vibrations at

    high frequencies around 10 THz cause Raman scattering. Brillouin scattering is
    caused by

    low-frequency vibrations in the range of 10 to 30 GHz. This scattering can then
    be used to

    measure the temperature along the ﬁbre [24].

    DTS technology is widely applied to inspect subsurface thermal properties. DTS
    can

    be used in various applications, such as investigating the hydro-geological conditions

    of downholes or determining the geological properties of aquifers. Especially
    in deep

    boreholes, its application provides notable beneﬁts over discrete-point temperature
    mea-

    surements [5]. DTS is widely used in long-term monitoring to determine the contribution

    of groundwater ﬂow and thermophysical characteristics to subsurface heat transfer
    and

    storage [16]. This type of technology is used to monitor the conditions inside
    well bores to

    optimize expensive workover procedures [17].

    2.1.2. Mobile Sensing

    Mobile sensing systems such as Geoball and Geosniff are small spheres 25 mm in

    diameter and 8 g in weight that have an embedded transceiver, microcontroller,
    temperature

    sensor and power supply. These miniaturized sensors are inserted into the pipes
    of a

    geothermal underground structure and are then carried by the thermal ﬂuid in order
    to

    monitor the thermal parameters of the ﬂuid along the borehole heat exchanger.
    These

    sensor systems allow the acquisition of information on the thermal properties
    of the

    subsurface geological structure and their inﬂuence on the thermal properties of
    the borehole.

    A wireless data processing unit sends data and acquires conﬁgurational information
    prior

    to measurement and retrieves measured thermal data from a sensor inside the U-tube
    of

    the borehole heat exchanger [18].

    These types of sensors have demonstrable advantages of higher reliability and
    lower

    cost over standard sensors and ﬁbre optics [13]. Fibre optic technologies such
    as high-

    temperature distributed acoustic sensors [25] are used for their unparalleled
    ability to

    discriminate and measure environmental variables such as strain, temperature and
    vibra-

    tions [26]. The purpose of the method is to improve the conventional thermal response

    test [18]. Compared to Pt100 sensors, mobile sensing systems are highly accurate
    and do

    not produce large, statistically signiﬁcant measurement deviations [13].

    2.2. Flow Rate Measurement

    The measurement of liquid and gaseous ﬂow rates in underground geothermal struc-

    tures is performed to manage and control various processes [1]. Flow rate measurement
    in

    geothermal structures applies techniques that differ in complexity, cost and the
    capability to

    perform real-time surveys. Table 3 summarizes the differences between individual
    methods

    of ﬂow rate measurement on the basis of four attributes: the ability to provide
    real-time

    measurements (real-time), the operational status of the underground structure
    (out of

    operation), direct contact between the medium and the sensing device (direct contact)
    and a

    list of the types of underground structures where the ﬂow rate measurement method
    is

    used (application location).

    In summary, each method, except for the calorimeter and tracer dilution, provides

    real-time measurements. The calorimeter and lip pressure are the only two methods
    used

    in decommissioned underground structures. Each method, except for compression
    load

    cells and the ultrasonic meter, has direct contact with the sensing medium. The
    application

    location includes geothermal power plants, open Venturi channels, geothermal pipelines

    and geothermal wells.

    Flow rate measurement can apply single ﬂow rate methods or hybrid ﬂow rate meth-

    ods. Hybrid methods combine two basic methods to reduce any deﬁciencies that single

    methods may introduce. Hybrid techniques are frequently used to measure two-phase

    ﬂuid ﬂow. The following subsections describe the individual methods listed in
    Table 3 for

    ﬂow rate measurement and estimation.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5577

    6 of 26

    2.2.1. Ultrasonic Meter

    Ultrasonic meters are devices that are composed of a receiver and transmitter
    and that

    use the phenomenon of sonic waves. The device is attached to the exterior of a
    pipeline

    and used to determine the ﬂow rate. The transmitted waves are detected by the
    receiver.

    The modiﬁcation of the wave frequency and amplitude is indicative of the properties
    of

    the ﬂuid/gas. There exist several methods that can be used to calculate the ﬁnal
    ﬂow rate,

    for example, based on the time of transit of the sonic waves [36], the Doppler
    Effect [37],

    cross-correlation [37] or changes in wave amplitude [38]. Ultrasonic sensors are
    used

    in many areas of industry. In underground structures, at least three sensors are
    used at

    different points [28], for example, at different locations along a channel [27].
    The advantage

    of an ultrasonic meter is that it does not come into contact with the ﬂuid/gas
    medium and

    is positioned on the outside of the pipeline [27].

    2.2.2. Calorimeter

    Figure 2 depicts a typical calorimeter conﬁguration that is used to measure enthalpy

    in geothermal wells in addition to the ﬂow rate. This method works on the principle
    of

    measuring the time that it takes to ﬁll a partially water-ﬁlled tank with geothermal
    ﬂuid.

    The time is then used to calculate the ﬂow rate [2].

    Figure 2. Block diagram of a calorimeter setup.

    The disadvantage of this technique is that it requires the geothermal well to
    halt

    production [1]. Another disadvantage is that it is only suitable for low-output
    wells, as the

    amount of discharge is restricted by the volume of the tank that can be delivered
    to the

    site. Another constraint is the limit on the maximum measurable ﬂow rate of 10
    kg/s [39].

    Measuring the ﬂow rate in this manner is also very noisy and cannot be performed
    in real

    time [40].

    2.2.3. Sharp-Edged Oriﬁce Plate

    An oriﬁce plate is a well-known alternative method that has been implemented in

    several geothermal applications all over the world [1]. The oriﬁce plate consists
    of a central

    circular hole that measures differential pressure by establishing pressure taps
    upstream

    and downstream. Figure 3 [2] illustrates a typical oriﬁce plate setup.

    Figure 3. Oriﬁce plate installed at a geothermal well.

    Oriﬁce plates are frequently used to measure the ﬂow of geothermal steam; extracting

    steam from the ground is the ﬁrst crucial step in converting geothermal steam
    energy into

    electricity [41]. The devices also measure brine ﬂow [2] and can identify the
    mass ﬂow rate

    of the well [42].

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5577

    7 of 26

    2.2.4. Tracer Dilution Method

    Tracer dilution is used to measure the enthalpy of geothermal ﬂuid in addition
    to the

    ﬂow rate. To determine the well performance, two different chemical tracers are
    injected

    into the ﬂuid stream in the pipe and mixed with water. Fluid tracers disperse
    into a

    liquid phase; gas tracers mainly disperse into a gaseous phase, but also partially
    into a

    liquid phase. Samples of vapor and water are then collected from the pipeline
    and tested

    to identify the dilution of the tracer in both phases and the background concentration.

    From this information, the ﬂow rate and enthalpy can be estimated [1]. The advantages
    of

    this method are the ability to keep the well online during measurement and the
    lack of an

    effect on the ﬂow; they are outweighed, however, by the large costs for lab testing
    [1], the

    poor precision of the results [2] and the lack of real-time measurement capability
    [43].

    2.2.5. Lip Pressure Method

    This method entails the use of a small hole measuring 6 mm in diameter and located

    6 mm away from the pipe lip. Empirical measurements of pressure are taken at this
    hole,

    and using the size of the pipe, an empirical correlation is used to calculate
    the ﬂow rate.

    Enthalpy and the total ﬂow can be determined based on information obtained from
    the ﬂow

    rate and lip pressure [32]. Two arrangements are available for this method, one
    in which

    ﬂuid is discharged into the atmosphere through a vertical lip pressure pipe and
    another in

    which it is discharged horizontally into a silencer on a horizontal lip pressure
    pipe. In the

    vertical arrangement, the pipe is connected to the top valve in a vertical position,
    and the

    ﬂuid’s enthalpy must be estimated based on the temperature of the primary supply
    zone [1].

    In the horizontal arrangement, the pipe discharges into the silencer, and the
    weir box located

    immediately downstream of the silencer monitors the water ﬂow. The method’s advantages

    include low running costs and real-time measurements, but it also has drawbacks,
    such as

    high noise levels and interruptions in operations during measurement [44].

    2.2.6. Venturi Tube

    The Venturi tube method is based on Bernoulli’s principle and is a very precise

    method used for measuring steam ﬂow [34]. The method can be used for online or
    real-time

    measurement, and its main advantage is a low and constant pressure drop. Its construction

    is complicated and expensive, however [2,45].

    2.2.7. Coriolis Flow Meter

    A Coriolis ﬂow meter consists of two curved tubes that vibrate symmetrically.
    The ﬂow

    of the medium is directed through these pipes, and any local changes in the vibration

    frequency due to the ﬂow rate are monitored. To calculate the ﬂow rate, changes
    in the

    frequency are measured by sensors, and empirical correlations are applied. Although
    this

    method enables real-time and online measurement, it is highly inaccurate and therefore
    an

    unpopular option [2,46].

    2.2.8. Compression Load Cells

    Compression load cells use strain gauge sensors to determine the ﬂow rate and

    enthalpy in geothermal pipelines and wells. The sensor is based on the piezoelectric
    effect,

    which is based on converting the mechanical power applied by the object (pipeline,
    well) to

    an electrostatic signal. The load sensor is positioned above a platform (compression
    type,

    Figure 4a) or above the object (tension type, Figure 4b) [35,47].

    Figure 4. Compression load cell method: An installation in a geothermal pipeline.
    (a) The load sensor

    is positioned above a platform. (b) The load sensor is positioned above an object.

    The advantages of this method are simple construction, measurement in real time

    and the lack of direct contact with the ﬂuid medium [35,47].

    2.2.9. Separator with Oriﬁce Plate and Silencer

    This hybrid method determines the ﬂow of a two-phase ﬂuid and consists of a sep-

    arator, an oriﬁce plate and a silencer with a weir. The ﬂuid separates into vapor
    and a

    liquid in a separator vessel at a pressure greater than atmospheric. The separate
    steam

    ﬂow is measured with an oriﬁce plate, while the separate liquid ﬂow is determined
    with

    either an oriﬁce plate or a silencer with a weir box. Because oriﬁce plates may
    produce

    unstable measurements due to ﬂash evaporation induced in the liquid, silencers
    are more

    commonly used for measuring the separate liquid ﬂow. The separator method is expensive

    to implement, but it enables high accuracy and online or real-time measurement
    [1,2].

    2.3. Measurement of Mechanical Parameters

    In addition to measuring temperature and ﬂow, monitoring mechanical parameters
    in

    underground structures is important for detecting potential risks. Underground
    structures

    such as borehole heat exchangers must be regularly checked for pressure to ensure
    that no

    ﬂuid leaks into the subsurface, groundwater or process water. Geothermal applications

    also use sensors to monitor other mechanical parameters, such as scale formation
    [3] and

    slope movement [4]. Mechanical parameters can be monitored with ﬁbre-optic sensors
    [48],

    tilt sensors [4], ultrasonic sensors [49], vibrating wire sensors [50] or strain
    gauges [51].

    Table 4 summarizes these sensing methods and their areas of application.

    Pressure is measured with strain gauges or optical sensors, usually in geothermal
    wells

    or reservoirs. Optical sensors are also used to detect the formation of scale
    in geothermal

    brine. In boreholes, ultrasonic sensors are deployed to detect breakouts, and
    tilt sensors

    measure information about slope movement and deformation. Vibrating wire sensors
    are

    used to measure stress in structures at geothermal or oil drilling wells.

    2.3.1. Optical Sensors

    Fibre-optic cables are used to measure pressure in geothermal wells [48]. Distributed

    acoustic sensing systems use ﬁbre-optic cables to measure oscillatory strain rates
    caused

    by oscillatory pressure changes. These cables have signiﬁcant advantages in being
    able to

    withstand harsh environments; they can be deployed for geomechanical, seismic
    and tem-

    perature monitoring [53]. Fibre-optic cables are capable of operating at temperatures
    up to

    315 ◦C and 20 MPa [51].

    2.3.2. Vibrating Wire Sensors

    Vibrating wire sensors can measure the stresses occurring in a structure and its
    sur-

    rounding environment. It is a frequency sensor with an internal metal string as
    the sensing

    component. The sensor’s output frequency signal changes according to the the stress
    on the

    metal string. The device is durable and simple in design and has a strong anti-interference

    ability [50]. The metal string vibrates as a result of excitation when an external
    force is

    applied, changing the tension in the wire, which changes the frequency of vibrations.

    The dependence between the vibration conductor and the vibration frequency is
    calculated

    from the equation:

    f = 1

    (1)

    where m is the mass of the vibrating string, L is the length of the vibrating
    string, F indicates

    the pressure on the sensor, and f is the resonant frequency of the string [54].
    These sensors

    are suitable for applications in geothermal or oil drilling wells [52].

    2.3.3. Tilt Sensors

    These sensors are used to obtain information about slope movements and deforma-

    tions. Tilt monitoring systems combine tilt sensors and LPWAN technology to measure

    slope movement and transmit collected data wirelessly. Data from tilt sensors
    and other

    additional parameters (rainfall data, groundwater level) are analyzed to predict
    slope

    failures [55].

    3. IoT Devices and Cloud Processing

    IoT technology is a growing research area. In 2021, the Web of ScienceTM library

    contained more than 13,000 indexed papers on the topic of IoT technology [56].
    IoT tech-

    nologies are deployed in many application areas, such as environmental monitoring
    [10],

    smart factories [57,58], smart cities [59] and smart grids [11,60]. Although IoT
    technol-

    ogy is widely deployed, only a few research articles cover the monitoring of geothermal

    energy installations.

    Fundamentally, an IoT device is an internet connection. In the context of this
    article,

    an IoT device is a small item of electronic equipment that is able to supervise
    several

    variables and transmit measured values to the cloud via a wireless connection.
    Figure 5

    illustrates the principal scheme of the IoT architecture and application areas.

    Figure 5. IoT architecture and application domains.

    Figure 6 shows a block diagram of a typical IoT solution. IoT devices generally
    contain

    the following parts: a power supply module, a sensory subsystem, a microcontroller
    (MCU),

    a transmission module (RF module) and data storage. Each block can be assembled
    from

    various components according to system requirements and deployment characteristics.

    Figure 6. Block diagram of a typical IoT solution.

    3.1. IoT Nodes

    An integral component of an IoT device is a power supply. To supply the device
    with

    power, many options are available, the simplest being a connection to a power
    grid; an

    example is an AC power monitoring module with an integrated wireless connection
    via

    WiFi [61]. Power grids provide sources of stable and reliable energy, but they
    are mainly

    only available in urban locations. Another option is the use of a battery [62].
    Batteries

    also provide stable sources of energy, but they require periodic charging and
    replace-

    ment. Battery-powered IoT devices can also be designed to operate for long life
    spans [10].

    Another option for supplying electricity is through energy harvesting methods
    [63]. Char-

    acterized by many advantages, energy harvesting modules are small, maintenance-free

    and inexpensive solutions, especially compared to battery-powered options. The
    main

    drawback of energy harvesting solutions, however, is limited available energy.

    Table 5 summarizes IoT power supply technologies according to the energy trans-

    ducer type. Selecting a suitable power supply type is strongly dependent on the
    target

    application [64]. In many geothermal applications [65], power grids are readily
    available,

    and generally, no energy harvesting or battery technologies are required. However,
    IoT

    measurement devices are often deployed directly in geothermal boreholes, where
    the in-

    stallation of a wired power supply is complicated [66]. Energy harvesting is therefore
    a

    highly suitable technology for these applications.

    Energy harvesting using solar panels or small wind turbines is suitable only for
    surface

    deployment, where sunlight and wind are sufﬁcient [72]. For underground structures,
    ther-

    moelectric generators (TEGs) have signiﬁcant potential as an energy harvesting
    technology.

    TEGs exploit the Seebeck effect to generate energy through temperature differentials
    [73].

    The main challenge with this technology is ﬁnding suitable temperature differences
    or

    gradients directly in a borehole for exposure to the TEG.

    Acting as brains, microcontrollers (MCUs) regulate IoT node behavior, such as
    sensor

    data collection, local memory storage and data transmission to the cloud. Since
    IoT nodes

    generally have only limited energy for operation [74], MCUs are also responsible
    for energy

    management. Naturally, they are selected from ultra-low-power series offered by
    silicon

    manufacturers to minimize the MCU’s own consumption. Examples of these series
    types

    are STM32L [75], NXP K32L [76] and Microchip PIC32MZ [77]. Speciﬁc models are
    selected

    according to the application, and generally, higher performance requires more
    energy.

    ULP (ultra-low-power) MCUs typically offer multiple switchable modes of operation

    and the ability to switch off individual peripherals (clock gating) for effective
    power

    management. Switching off all components not currently in use thus reduces the
    overall

    energy consumption [78,79].

    IoT nodes are usually equipped with local data storage, which can be used for
    either

    the long-term storage of accumulated values or short-term storage (as a memory
    buffer).

    As with other IoT node components, power consumption is one of the crucial parameters

    in selecting memory and is dependent on the type of memory used. Ferroelectric
    Random-

    Access Memory (FRAM) is a type of memory technology with low energy consumption,

    but its data capacity is limited to a few dozen MB. At the other end of the spectrum
    of

    data capacity is ﬂash memory, commonly found in SD cards, with maximum capacities

    of hundreds of GB. The disadvantage of ﬂash memory is higher energy consumption
    and

    signiﬁcantly slower data write speeds. Data storage memory may form either a discrete

    component in an IoT node or be integrated into the MCU [80].

    3.2. Data Transmission Technologies

    Underground geothermal structures are often situated in remote areas where no
    easy

    connection to the internet for monitoring purposes is possible (i.e., WiFi or
    Ethernet).

    In these areas, monitoring equipment is usually powered by batteries or energy
    obtained by

    harvesting (see Section 3.1), and energy consumption must be low. GSM/LTE technology

    does not satisfy this low-power requirement, but LPWAN technology is ideal. These
    types

    of systems were developed for the IoT and feature reliable, long-distance wireless
    data

    transmission (1–40 km), with minimal power consumption. The commonly used LPWAN

    technologies are currently LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT [81,82].

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5577

    12 of 26

    3.2.1. LoRaWAN

    LoRaWAN is a wireless communication protocol based on the patented LoRa tech-

    nology. The patent was granted in 2014 to Semtec, and the ﬁrst LoRaWAN protocol

    speciﬁcation was released in 2015. The standards are now managed by the LoRa Alliance.

    Transceivers have a low sensitivity to noise and thus a greater range thanks to
    forward

    error correction (FEC), together with a proprietary spread spectrum modulation
    technique.

    The operating radio frequency varies according to the region of deployment and
    its local

    regulations, but it always belongs to a license-free band. A LoRaWAN network typically

    includes the following network elements. The end device is application-dependent,
    pro-

    vides control or measurement functions (sensor, actuator) and is wirelessly connected
    to the

    LoRaWAN network via a gateway. The gateway receives and forwards messages (usually

    via the internet) to a network server. The network server provides network management

    functions such as data processing, message deduplication, conﬁguration and scheduling,

    bandwidth regulation and message routing. The application server remotely collects
    data

    from sensors and transmits commands to device actuators [83,84].

    The technology has a range of 5 km (urban) to 20 km (rural) [85]. Depending on
    the

    conﬁguration, the payload can contain up to 242 bytes of data [86].

    LoRa deﬁnes three device classes:

    •

    Class A—End devices can start transmission (uplink) at any time, while the base

    station transmits data only for a short time once the uplink is complete. Each
    uplink

    time slot is followed by two downlink slots, after which the receiver switches
    off. This

    class has the lowest energy demand.

    •

    Class B—Devices have the same uplink and downlink slots as Class A, plus one extra

    downlink slot. The end-device receiver is switched on for this extra slot according
    to a

    predetermined schedule. The base station is programmed to follow this schedule.

    •

    Class C—Receivers can listen continuously, except in transmit mode. This class
    of

    device is ideal for applications that require many downlink transmissions because

    the base station broadcasts at any time. Its disadvantage is higher power consump-

    tion [87].

    3.2.2. Sigfox

    Sigfox is a company based in France providing network connectivity within the
    IoT

    through its eponymous wireless technology. It was founded in 2010 with a focus
    on low-

    consumption IoT devices that require the transmission of small amounts of data
    over longer

    distances [87].

    Sigfox can operate in either simplex (one-way) or half-duplex (two-way) mode.
    An up-

    load packet can comprise a maximum of 12 bytes of payload, while a download packet

    is limited to 8 bytes of payload. The operational range of this network reaches
    up to

    40 km [87,88]. Such a value is achieved by combining several techniques. The ﬁrst
    of them

    is the use of ultra-narrowband (UNB); such a narrow frequency selection increases
    the

    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A combination of Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying
    (GFSK)

    and Differential Binary Phase-Shift Keying (DBPSK) is used for signal modulation
    in the

    physical layer. Delivery reliability is increased by sending the same message
    multiple

    times. Duplicate messages are sent on randomly selected frequencies with random
    delays

    from the ﬁrst one. Sigfox relies on a license-free band reserved for industrial,
    scientiﬁc and

    medical (ISM) purposes. The speciﬁc frequency then depends on the deployment region.

    In addition to the maximum transmission power, the regulation also sets a duty
    cycle limit.

    Because of this, the end device is limited to 140 messages per day in the case
    of sending

    and 4 messages in the case of receiving [88,89].

    3.2.3. NB-IoT

    Narrowband IoT is another LPWAN technology available today. It was developed by

    the 3GPP organization, with the ﬁrst NB-IoT standard deﬁned in 2016. This communication

    network is based on and is directly linked to the GSM/LTE cellular network standard.

    Modiﬁcations consist of changes in the original technology to best meet the requirements

    for IoT end-device network connectivity (such as low power consumption, low cost
    or the

    transmission of small amounts of data over longer distances). Compared to the
    LTE

    protocol, NB-IoT only allows half-duplex at a bandwidth of 180 kHz. Modulation
    schemes

    more complex than π/4–QPSK are not supported. Not all parts of the E-UTRA speciﬁcation

    are implemented either. Thanks to this aspect, the receiver is simpler and therefore
    less

    energy-demanding and lower in price [90–92].

    The standard allows transmission using both unlicensed bands and licensed GSM/LTE

    brands in one of the following operation modes:

    •

    Stand-alone operation—When using this mode, NB-IoT is the exclusive user of the

    selected frequency band.

    •

    Guard-band operation—In this mode, NB-IoT data are transmitted through an unused

    frequency band next to, or between, LTE bands (the so-called guard band).

    •

    In-band operation—LTE data together with NB-IoT data share the same carrier. This

    can have a negative impact on the quality of both services [90,93].

    The existing LTE network provider often only needs to modify the software to operate

    the NB-IoT network if it decides to deploy the guard-band or in-band model. This
    approach

    is also recommended by the 3GPP organization itself. The usable distance of the
    IoT node

    from the base station is up to 10 km [85]. The payload of one message is limited
    to 1600 bytes.

    There is no limit on the number of messages transferred per day when using the
    licensed

    band. NB-IoT relies, like the LTE protocol, on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing

    (OFDM) to transmit downlink messages. In the case of uplink transactions, OFDM
    is

    replaced by single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA). This
    reduces the

    value of the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) [94].

    3.2.4. Comparison of LPWANs

    The information in Table 6 indicates that the individual technologies differ,
    although they

    are all speciﬁc to LPWANs. The key advantage of Sigfox over its competitors is
    the

    size of the area covered by a single base station, up to 40 km in rural areas.
    Under the

    same conditions, the main competitors achieve a coverage of approximately 20 km
    with

    LoRaWAN and 10 km with NB-IoT [95]. NB-IoT is also limited to areas with LTE networks.

    In terms of deployment, LoRaWAN allows the creation of private networks, while
    the other

    two technologies rely only on the provider deployment model [96]. NB-IoT is aligned
    with

    applications that require the transfer of large amounts of data or that need a
    low-latency

    network. Sigfox offers a payload volume approximately 100 times lower than NB-IoT

    (maximum 1600 B). LoRaWAN provides a payload of 242 B, and latency can be reduced

    using class C devices [86]. All of these technologies offer sleep modes to reduce
    the energy

    consumption of a transmitter to a minimum when the end device is not transmitting.
    NB-

    IoT nodes have higher power requirements than LoRaWAN and Sigfox, drawing the
    highest

    peak currents during transmission through the use of QPSK modulation in combination

    with OFDM-FDMA and QoS handling [85,97]. LoRaWAN and Sigfox are ALOHA-based

    and operate on unlicensed frequencies. NB-IoT relies on licensed LTE bands, which
    ensure

    higher QoS through regulation, but a consequence is a higher price for the end
    customer

    due to license fees [95].

    3.3. Cloud Services

    Cloud services involve infrastructure, platforms and software delivered on demand

    to companies and customers via the internet. Cloud services employ cloud computing

    solutions and do not encumber the hardware or software of devices accessing the
    service.

    The variety of available cloud services may disguise the level of an organization’s
    ownership

    of the stack [98]. For clarity, cloud service models can be grouped into four
    main categories

    according to how they are managed (Figure 7).

    Figure 7. Cloud model types: on premises, infrastructure as a service, platform
    as a service and

    software as a service.

    •

    On Premises (Private Cloud)—This cloud model is in fact not a genuine cloud service.

    It is suitable for users who require data protection and security and are willing
    to

    pay more for the service. Because data and all infrastructure, including software

    and hardware, are on the premises, the system is managed by the user’s own IT

    team. In-house maintenance requirements and ﬁxed scalability mean that this type
    of

    deployment is the most expensive.

    •

    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—IaaS allows customers to outsource equipment
    such

    as storage, servers and network resources. The remainder of the stack is managed
    by

    the customer. The disadvantage of IaaS is the potential for vendor outages and
    the

    cost of training personnel to manage new infrastructure.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5577

    15 of 26

    •

    Platform as a Service (PaaS)—The provider manages everything as in IaaS but is
    also

    responsible for the base software and operating system, middleware and database.

    The drawback of PaaS is potential security problems and greater dependency on

    the vendor.

    •

    Software as a Service (SaaS)—This model completely transfers the management of
    all

    components to the vendor service provider [99,100].

    Table 7 summarizes the features of three widely used cloud services: Amazon Web
    Ser-

    vices (AWS), Microsoft Azure IoT, Google Cloud Platform [101–103], and IBM cloud
    [104].

    Generally, these state-of-the-art cloud providers dedicate broad support to services
    and

    applications designed for the IoT and standard communication interfaces for connecting

    IoT devices to a cloud. They also feature powerful scalable data storage and support
    for

    big data analysis.

    3.4. Edge Computing

    Edge computing is a method with enormous potential for IoT geothermal monitoring.

    Edge computing allows some computation and data storage to be moved closer to
    the

    source of the data, enabling the optimization of IoT node transmissions.

    Geothermal installations make use of a speciﬁc IoT domain. Table 8 provides a

    summary of some service-oriented architectures for edge computing methods suitable

    for use in geothermal installations. Early warning systems can monitor a geothermal

    installation and evaluate hazardous states. An example of this type of solution
    is an

    early warning system for railway bridges [105]. Edge computing also allows the
    real-time

    monitoring of natural disasters such as ﬁres [106] or earthquakes [107]. These
    solutions

    tolerate multiple node faults and partial network disruptions and store all data
    locally,

    which also enhances privacy [107].

    compression can be lossy or lossless. The scientiﬁc literature on data compression
    in edge

    computing is vast [110].

    3.5. IoT in Geothermal Applications

    IoT is chosen over telemetry in geothermal installations due to its ability to
    provide

    continuous monitoring and real-time data collection of temperature, pressure,
    and other

    mechanical parameters. IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can collect
    data from

    various points in the geothermal installation, providing a more comprehensive
    view of the

    system’s performance. Additionally, IoT devices can transmit data wirelessly,
    eliminating

    the need for wired connections and reducing installation and maintenance costs
    [111].

    Comparison of Telemetry Systems and IoT Device is sumarized in Table 9.

    multiple sensors simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive view of the system’s

    performance [112]. Secondly, IoT devices can transmit data wirelessly, eliminating
    the need

    for wired connections and reducing installation and maintenance costs [113]. Thirdly,
    IoT

    devices can be programmed to send alerts when certain parameters exceed predeﬁned

    thresholds, allowing for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention.

    The lack or improper use of telemetry in geothermal installations can lead to
    several

    problems. Firstly, telemetry systems can be expensive to install and maintain,
    especially in

    remote locations. Secondly, telemetry systems can be prone to signal interference
    and data

    loss, leading to inaccurate or incomplete data. Thirdly, telemetry systems can
    be difﬁcult to

    integrate with other monitoring systems, leading to data silos and reduced visibility
    of the

    system’s performance [114].

    In contrast, IoT devices are relatively inexpensive and easy to install and maintain.

    Additionally, IoT devices can be integrated with other monitoring systems, providing
    a

    more comprehensive view of the system’s performance [115]. Finally, IoT devices
    can

    be programmed to send alerts when certain parameters exceed predeﬁned thresholds,

    allowing for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention.

    In summary, IoT is chosen over telemetry in geothermal installations due to its
    ability

    to provide continuous monitoring and real-time data collection of temperature,
    pressure,

    and other mechanical parameters. IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can
    collect

    data from various points in the geothermal installation, providing a more comprehensive

    view of the system’s performance. Additionally, IoT devices can transmit data
    wirelessly,

    eliminating the need for wired connections and reducing installation and maintenance

    costs. The lack or improper use of telemetry in geothermal installations can lead
    to several

    problems, including high costs, signal interference, and data silos [116].

    IoT devices have the potential to revolutionize geothermal monitoring, but they
    also

    pose several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure reliable operation
    and minimize

    the generation of erroneous data. Here are some strategies to confront these challenges:

    1.

    Ensure reliable operation: To ensure reliable operation of IoT devices in geothermal

    installations, it is essential to choose devices that are designed to withstand
    the harsh

    environmental conditions of the installation. This includes selecting devices
    that are

    rated for high temperatures, humidity, and corrosion resistance. Additionally,
    regular

    maintenance and calibration of the devices can help ensure reliable operation
    [117].

    2.

    Prevent malfunctions due to exceeding recommended temperature ranges: IoT devices

    can malfunction if they are exposed to temperatures outside their recommended

    range. To prevent this, it is essential to monitor the temperature of the devices
    and

    the surrounding environment and take appropriate measures to prevent overheating.

    This can include installing cooling systems or using devices with built-in temperature

    sensors and automatic shut-off features.

    3.

    Minimize the generation of erroneous data: IoT devices can generate erroneous
    data

    due to factors such as sensor drift, signal interference, and data loss. To minimize

    this, it is essential to use high-quality sensors and ensure that the devices
    are properly

    calibrated and maintained [118]. Additionally, data validation and error correction

    algorithms can be used to identify and correct erroneous data.

    4.

    Transition from elementary sensors to more complex MCU-based IoT devices: The

    transition from elementary sensors to more complex MCU-based IoT devices can

    bring several implications, including increased complexity, higher costs, and
    the

    need for specialized expertise. To address these challenges, it is essential to
    carefully

    evaluate the beneﬁts and drawbacks of using MCU-based IoT devices and ensure that

    the devices are properly designed, installed, and maintained. Additionally, training

    and support for personnel responsible for operating and maintaining the devices
    can

    help ensure their reliable operation.

    In summary, confronting the challenges posed by IoT devices in geothermal installations

    requires careful consideration of the devices’ design, installation, and maintenance.
    Strategies

    such as ensuring reliable operation, preventing malfunctions due to exceeding
    recommended

    temperature ranges, minimizing the generation of erroneous data, and carefully
    evaluating the

    transition from elementary sensors to more complex MCU-based IoT devices can help
    ensure

    the successful implementation of IoT-based geothermal monitoring systems [119].

    In the construction and electronic placement of geothermal IoT monitoring systems,

    careful consideration should be given to the potential high temperatures of an
    environment

    or a medium [120]. Geothermal environments can expose the equipment to extreme
    heat,

    which can pose challenges to the proper functioning of electronic components.
    It is crucial to

    protect the silicon parts used in these systems, as they have maximum temperature
    limits that

    should not be exceeded. Adequate measures and safeguards must be implemented to
    ensure

    the longevity and reliable operation of IoT devices in such high-temperature conditions
    [121].

    The advance of IoT technology has brought about a push for standardization in
    various

    aspects of its implementation. Standardization includes the adoption of common
    LPWAN

    communication protocols, the use of standardized components on the cloud side,
    and

    the establishment of methodologies for creating IoT nodes [122]. This standardization

    effort aims to streamline and simplify the development and deployment process
    of IoT

    systems. In contrast, telemetry systems often lack standardization and are often
    proprietary,

    leading to increased expenses and longer development cycles. The absence of standardized

    approaches in telemetry results in prolonged development times and delays in bringing

    products to market, ultimately driving up costs. By embracing standardization
    in IoT,

    organizations can beneﬁt from reduced development costs, shorter time to market,
    and

    improved interoperability between different IoT devices and systems [123].

    4. Research Challenges

    This article describes options for geothermal monitoring and recent trends in
    the

    application of IoT technologies. This section discusses research challenges for
    potential

    applications of IoT sensor technology in underground geothermal structures to
    extend

    current installations and deliver more robust solutions for future installations.
    Innovations

    for speciﬁc equipment technologies (sensors, edge-computing, energy harvesting,
    IoT

    nodes, etc.) are also discussed.

    Figure 8 illustrates the research challenges outlined in this article, labeled

    4.1. New Potential Applications

    Underground geothermal structures are designed for long-term use; therefore, the

    proper management of the installation’s operational life is required. As mentioned
    in

    Section 1, eliminating undesirable states (e.g., thermal imbalance, the absence
    of turbulent

    ﬂuid ﬂow and the unforced operation of heat pumps during cooling) during the operation

    of an underground geothermal structure is beneﬁcial. Long-term monitoring with
    IoT

    sensors can facilitate the optimal operation of underground geothermal structures,
    prolong

    system endurance and optimize standard operations. Table 10 lists several undesirable

    states and potential solutions.

    Table 10. Undesirable states and potential solutions.

    Undesirable State

    Solution

    Thermal imbalance

    Monitoring of individual boreholes

    Absence of turbulent ﬂuid ﬂow

    Higher ﬂow rate or pipes with spiral ribbing (to address low ﬂow rates)

    Unforced operation of the heat pump during cooling

    Heat pump not operational during cooling

    Critical stress change

    Temperature monitoring of critical limits with adequate reduction of

    ﬂow rate

    Volumetric change in concrete in pile

    Application of pressure cell monitoring at the head of the pile between the

    pile and concrete slab

    Thermal imbalance during the operation of an underground geothermal structure
    is

    caused by the heterogeneity of the rock environment. To eliminate thermal imbalances,
    the

    monitoring of individual boreholes is a potential solution. The absence of turbulent
    ﬂuid

    ﬂow can be avoided with higher ﬂow rates. Low ﬂow rates in the geothermal structure
    can

    be speciﬁcally addressed with turbocollectors (pipes with spiral ribbing), which
    guarantee

    that the Reynolds number of the ﬂow is exceeded. The last undesirable state is
    the operation

    of the heat pump during cooling.

    The thermal stress of the pile must be monitored for mechanical property stability

    (strength and deformation parameters). A change in concrete temperature due to
    heat

    transfer (charging and discharging) produces a change in the stresses experienced
    by the

    concrete in the pile. This change in stress consequently produces volumetric changes
    in the

    concrete. In critical cases, the brittle failure of the concrete occurs, and the
    bearing capacity

    of the pile as a whole is reduced.

    Another beneﬁt of the long-term monitoring of currently deployed geothermal installa-

    tions is the continuous data collection of operational parameters. Large datasets
    describing

    geothermal installation behavior during regular operation and also non-standard
    condi-

    tions can be created. IoT technologies allow the extensive monitoring of existing
    structures,

    and therefore, the knowledge base will contain new and important information that
    is use-

    ful for design work for future underground geothermal structures. Table 11 lists
    parameters

    whose monitoring could aid in producing improved designs for future applications.

    Table 11. List of parameters whose monitoring could aid in producing improved
    designs for fu-

    ture applications.

    Monitored Parameter

    Monitoring Purpose

    Flow rate at each borehole

    Techno-economic optimization (selection of suitable pipe diameters and energy
    consumption)

    Temperature at each borehole

    Optimization of designs for well depth

    Utilizing measurement and monitoring techniques for borehole properties, particularly

    temperature and ﬂow rate, presents an opportunity to enhance future applications.
    Flow

    rate monitoring could aid in techno-economic optimization through the selection
    of suitable

    pipe diameters and optimal energy consumption models. Temperature monitoring could

    be applied to optimize designs for the well depth (the length of the borehole).

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5577

    Many underground geothermal structure walls do not permit the use of sensor tech-

    nologies due to wired sensor limitations or the absence of power grid connections.
    Such

    installations may include sensors that are installed during the construction process
    and are

    subsequently inaccessible or insular systems where a power supply connection is
    difﬁcult

    to build. Energy harvesting technologies have excellent potential as solutions
    for such

    cases through their ability to generate electricity for sensor operation directly
    from the

    ambient environment.

    IoT monitoring systems for geothermal structures can be powered by harvesting
    en-

    ergy from the environment. Table 12 lists energy harvesting methods suitable for
    powering

    these types of IoT sensors. The most promising energy harvesting method is the
    use of

    TEG technology, whose main advantage is the absence of moving mechanical parts
    and the

    possibility of placing the device directly into a borehole. Another option is
    to use water

    pipeline energy harvesting. This type of energy harvesting system can also be
    placed into

    a borehole, but only inside a pipe. Water pipeline energy harvesting modules also
    have

    the disadvantage of moving mechanical parts. The third energy harvesting option
    is solar

    and wind energy. Solar panels or wind turbines cannot be placed into boreholes,
    however,

    and must be located on the surface and be connected to the IoT sensor inside the
    borehole

    with wires.

    to monitor under-

    ground geothermal structure parameters.

    4.2. Technological Innovations

    The process of constructing an underground geothermal structure requires many

    technological components. Most of these components do not support direct monitoring,

    and deploying sensors in existing installations is therefore problematic. The
    next generation

    of components could integrate physical sensors directly into equipment. A solution
    such as

    this not only permits IoT monitoring but also provides a sensory interface for
    any type of

    analytical equipment, such as DTS technology. In principle, components with embedded

    sensors add value at minimal cost. Technological improvements would involve the
    installa-

    tion of optical ﬁbres directly into the underground geothermal structure and the
    positioning

    of temperature sensors in the borehole at various depths. These improvements have
    the po-

    tential beneﬁt of optimizing the efﬁciency of the installation. While this solution
    addresses

    certain aspects of the problem, such as improving functionality or performance,
    it does

    not still provide a comprehensive solution for maintenance or replacement requirements.

    In order to ensure sustained effectiveness, it is crucial to consider the high
    reliability of

    components involved. Moreover, a key expectation for this solution is its ability
    to support

    long-term deployment without signiﬁcant interruptions or failures.

    Energy harvesting transducers can power IoT sensors, but the transducer design
    must

    be optimized and aligned with the installation to establish the best energy gains.
    Thermo-

    electric generators are a promising technology, but they must be deployed in environments

    with effective temperature gradients. Temperature gradients for thermoelectric
    generator

    purposes are found in environments that ﬂuctuate between medium and ambient tempera-

    tures, between warm and cold branches, and between shallow soil (50 cm below ground)

    and ambient air.

    Underground monitoring generally faces problems with data transmission. Regular

    connections with the cloud can be solved in two ways: a transmission antenna can
    be placed

    on the surface, or new types of underground antennae suitable for IoT communications

    must be developed.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5577

    21 of 26

    The ﬁnal research challenge involves innovating the communication interface and

    cloud data processing. Computationally limited, low-power IoT nodes require effective

    data transmission solutions that can be delivered through edge computing techniques
    or

    event-based approaches (Table 13).

    Table 13. Summary of edge computing techniques.

    Edge Computing Technique

    Application

    Metadata analysis

    Early warning systems, hazardous state monitoring

    Data compression

    IoT monitoring

    Edge computing allows metadata analysis in situ and provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts

    for data transmission; for example, IoT nodes monitoring a geothermal energy installation

    conserve energy and resources by transmitting data only if a hazardous state arises.
    The

    data transmission time and the volume of data stored in the cloud are reduced
    by storing

    raw sensor data locally, and the use of cloud computational resources is minimized.

    IoT monitoring systems designed for the real-time collection of data from geothermal

    energy installations can also be optimized with edge computing data compression
    methods

    to reduce the total volume of transmitted data. Truncated data can also be uploaded
    when

    energy for transmission is limited, followed by detailed data transmission in
    the future

    when energy is sufﬁcient.

    Challenges section. State-of-the-art solutions provide the potential for new applications

    that address several problematic conditions in geothermal energy installations.
    Monitoring

    systems allow the collection of important datasets that can be used to improve
    future

    designs of geothermal energy installations. Several technological innovation techniques

    could also improve the operation of IoT monitoring devices. Operating nodes in
    monitoring

    systems can be powered from harvested ambient energy to prolong the operating
    time

    and reduce costs. Edge computing methods can optimize data transmission and power

    consumption and provide early warnings of faulty or inefﬁcient operating conditions
    in

    geothermal energy installations.

    \ Along with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology over\
    \ the past\nfew years, opportunities for its implementation in service areas that\
    \ require real-time requirements\nhave begun to be recognized. In this regard,\
    \ one of the most important criteria is to maintain Quality\nof Service (QoS)\
    \ parameters at an appropriate and sufﬁciently high level. The QoS level should\n\
    ensure the delivery of data packets in the shortest time possible while preventing\
    \ critical parameters\nrelevant to real-time transmission from being exceeded.\
    \ This article proposes a new methodology\nfor designing real-time IoT systems.\
    \ The premise of the proposed approach is to adapt selected\nsolutions used in\
    \ other types of systems working with real-time requirements. Some analogy to\n\
    embedded systems with a distributed architecture has been noted and used in this\
    \ regard. The\nmain differences from the concept of built-in systems can primarily\
    \ be seen in the communication\nlayer. The methodology proposed in this article\
    \ is based on the authors’ proposed model of real-time\nsystem functional speciﬁcation\
    \ and its mapping to the IoT architecture. In addition, the developed\nmethodology\
    \ makes extensive use of selected IoT architecture elements described in this\
    \ article, as\nwell as selected task scheduling methods and communication protocols.\
    \ The proposed methodology\nfor designing RTIoT systems is based on dedicated\
    \ transmission serialization methods and dedicated\nrouting protocols. These methods\
    \ ensure that the time constraints for the assumed bandwidth of IoT\nlinks are\
    \ met by appropriately prioritizing transmissions and determining communication\
    \ routes.\nThe presented approach can be used to design a broad class of RTIoT\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: real time; IoT; tasks scheduling; communication protocols\n\
    1. Introduction\nFor a number of years, there has been a continuous and rapid\
    \ development of products\nand services in the area of Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ technology [1–4]. Research in this arena\nis focused on introducing new solutions\
    \ in the form of dedicated, smart, specialized and\nautonomous systems [5–8].\
    \ The main reason for the widespread use of IoT solutions is\nusually the desire\
    \ to improve people’s lifestyle and comfort, the optimal use of natural\nresources,\
    \ and the low energy consumption of these solutions [9–12]. IoT solutions in\n\
    this area often provide previously unattainable levels of efﬁciency while minimizing\
    \ the\ncontribution of the human factor. This trend is being forced by the ever-increasing\
    \ demands\nof proﬁt optimization in all industries and economies, as well as the\
    \ quality and safety of\nlife demands of speciﬁc groups of consumers and even\
    \ entire global communities [13].\nThe most up-to-date literature describes numerous\
    \ examples of implementations\nof classical IoT solutions for various purposes.\
    \ As is well known, the so-called “smart”\nsystems, e.g., smart homes, smart factories,\
    \ smart cities, and smart grids, have gained\ngreat popularity [14,15]. In addition,\
    \ a number of systems have been developed for the\nmedical [16], automotive [17],\
    \ agricultural [18], property protection [19], logistics [20], and\nsports and\
    \ recreation [21] industries, as well as many other areas related to the immediate\n\
    needs of the public. Smart systems for managing amusement parks [7,8,22]; automated\n\
    customer service solutions based on speech recognition techniques and voice assistants\
    \ [23];\nfacial recognition and motion detection systems used for security and\
    \ access control [24];\nElectronics 2022, 11, 4120. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11244120\n\

    smart systems for managing [25,26], controlling [27], and optimizing production\
    \ pro-\ncesses [28–30]; and real-time object location systems [12,31,32] are being\
    \ implemented.\nThe aforementioned solutions are just a few examples of the known\
    \ applications of IoT\ntechnology. The possibilities of implementing traditional\
    \ solutions are very wide and\nmainly depend on the needs of the recipients and\
    \ the ingenuity of their designers, thus\ninﬂuencing the development of a certain\
    \ area of the service market.\nAt the same time, it should be noted that services\
    \ and products where real-time\ntransmission requirements play a key role are\
    \ still major constraints in the implementa-\ntion of IoT solutions. The need\
    \ to design real-time applications for IoT (RTIoT) solutions\nwas recognized more\
    \ than 10 years ago [33]. The ﬁrst technologies and standards in this\narea also\
    \ began to emerge at that time. Examples include: ITCC (Intel Time Coordinated\n\
    Computing) [34,35], TSN (Time Sensitive Network) [36], M2M (Machine to Machine\
    \ Com-\nmunication) [37], SaaS (Sensing as a Service) [38], and a multi-layered\
    \ reference model\ndedicated to IoE (Internet of Everything) technologies [3].\
    \ However, most work to date\nin the ﬁeld of RTIoT systems has only been concerned\
    \ with trying to develop selected\nelements of the IoT architecture [39] or applications\
    \ and technologies [40,41] optimized\nfor the highest possible QoS (Quality of\
    \ Service). These mostly deal with issues related\nto real-time transmission and\
    \ protocols, server applications, or real-time databases. As\npreviously mentioned,\
    \ there was a need for real-time transmission early in the development\nof the\
    \ internet, mainly for the purpose of transmitting multimedia data. The RTP/RSTP\
    \ [42]\nor XMPP [43] protocols in use at the time did not allow for the parameters\
    \ associated with\ntime constraints to be met. It was not until the development\
    \ of the IEEE 802.1 standard\nin the form of the TSN solution that some conditions\
    \ were created for the development\nof data transmission methods that considered\
    \ time parameters. However, this standard\nonly deﬁnes basic mechanisms for time\
    \ synchronization, transmission scheduling or re-\nsource reservation. It does\
    \ not specify speciﬁc communication protocols or algorithms\nfor scheduling and\
    \ routing data transmission [44]. In terms of server applications, there\nis ongoing\
    \ work on cloud computing. This work focuses on developing real-time cloud\nservices,\
    \ scheduling tasks according to real-time requirements, and developing web servers\n\
    that handle requests with time constraints [45–47]. Real-time databases, on the\
    \ other hand,\ndeﬁne real time as the fastest execution of queries to a database.\
    \ Examples of such databases\nare VoltDB [48] and Firebase [49].\nAlthough it\
    \ is possible to ﬁnd numerous publications presenting examples of IoT ap-\nplications\
    \ running in real time, these solutions are not fully compatible with the concept\
    \ of\na real-time system. Typically, these solutions are highly optimized in terms\
    \ of data process-\ning and data transmission performance so the time requirements\
    \ under typical operating\nconditions are met. However, such solutions do not\
    \ provide the required QoS level when\noperating conditions change (e.g., with\
    \ higher network load). Moreover, providing high\nperformance is often associated\
    \ with signiﬁcant costs of computing and communication\nresources. Additionally,\
    \ the methodologies of designing RTIoT systems that take cost and\nQoS optimization\
    \ into account are unknown. Constraints related to real-time requirements\nare\
    \ currently one of the main challenges faced by IoT system research, and they\
    \ were also\nthe main motivation for the authors of this study to carry out the\
    \ presented research.\nThe purpose of this work was to identify the problems and\
    \ needs that exist in the\ndesign of RTIoT systems, to identify research directions\
    \ to solve these problems, and to\npropose a design methodology that considers\
    \ the requirements of RTIoT systems. The\ncontribution to the body of knowledge\
    \ of this article is:\n•\nThe proposal of a methodology for designing real-time\

    \ methodology proposed in this article is\nan analysis of approaches used in other\
    \ classes of real-time systems. In particular, one can\nsee a certain analogy\
    \ with embedded systems, or rather, IoT systems can be seen as a certain\ngeneralization\
    \ or development of the concept of embedded systems with a distributed\narchitecture.\
    \ The differences are particularly evident in the communication layer. This\n\
    article presents a proposed methodology based on analogous approaches to the synthesis\n\
    of embedded systems.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section\
    \ 2 describes the functional\nspeciﬁcation model and synthesis process for real-time\
    \ systems, and Section 3 considers\nselected components of IoT systems in relation\
    \ to real-time requirements. Section 4 is\ndevoted to an analysis of task scheduling\
    \ methods and communication protocols possible\nto apply in RTIoT systems, and\
    \ Section 5 describes the new methodology for designing\nRTIoT systems proposed\
    \ by the authors. The summary and conclusions are provided\nin Section 6.\n2.\
    \ Functional Speciﬁcation Model and Synthesis of Real-Time Systems\nThe design\
    \ methodology for complex IT systems usually consists of two stages:\n•\nDeveloping\
    \ a high-level model: The system model allows for an analysis to validate\nand\
    \ optimize the proposed solution. This is particularly important in the case of\n\
    distributed systems, where the veriﬁcation of the communication and synchronization\n\
    mechanisms used between processes is of signiﬁcance.\n•\nMapping the model to\
    \ the target architecture: It is possible to map to a standard\narchitecture (e.g.,\
    \ a multi-core processor) or to synthesize a specialized architecture\noptimized\
    \ for a given application.\n2.1. IoT Application System Model\nThe ﬁrst stage\
    \ of design is to create a system model of the application. The system\nmodel\
    \ represents the application function at the highest abstraction level, where\
    \ tasks\n(processes) and interactions between tasks are distinguished. At this\
    \ level, what a task does\nis not as important as when it is activated, what the\
    \ synchronization between tasks is, and\nhow the tasks communicate with each other.\
    \ Typically, system models are graph models.\nExisting methods use various system\
    \ models. We can distinguish, for example:\n•\nTask Graph (TG): one of the simplest\
    \ and most popular methods of representing\nfunctions at the system level. It\
    \ is a directed acyclic graph in which nodes represent\ntasks and edges represent\
    \ the order in which tasks are performed (usually representing\ntransmissions).\
    \ The task is activated when all preceding ones are completed. In this\nway, sequential\
    \ dependencies between tasks are presented. Transmission volumes\nare represented\
    \ by edge weights. A sample task graph is shown in Figure 1. The\ngraph describes\
    \ a six-task system. Tasks on the same path in the graph are sequentially\nexecuted,\
    \ while tasks from parallel paths can be executed in parallel. Extended\nversions\
    \ of task graphs can also be found in the literature, e.g., conditional task graphs\n\
    and multimodal task graphs [50,51]. Such models allow for the speciﬁcation of\
    \ special\ncases, such as the conditional or alternative performance of certain\
    \ tasks.\n•\nSDF (Synchronous Data Flow) or SSDF (Statically Schedulable Data\
    \ Flow): models\nrepresenting data ﬂow (often used in modeling telecommunications\
    \ applications).\nLike the TG, SDF is a directed graph. Unlike the TG, cycles\
    \ can occur in SDF. The\nsynchronization mechanism is described by determining\
    \ the number of tags generated\nby the execution of a given task (for each output\
    \ edge). The number of tags taken from\neach input is also speciﬁed for each task.\
    \ The task is activated if the required number\nof tags is available on all inputs.\n\
    •\nSTATECHARTS: a model based on a FSM (Finite State Machine), models based on\n\
    a description in the form of various forms of automation enable the speciﬁcation\
    \ of\ncontrol ﬂow. Unlike a classic FSM, state charts enable parallel descriptions\
    \ and task\nspeciﬁcations. Tasks are related to transitions between states.\n\

    \ are also a number of other methods that often target specific classes of appli-\n\
    cations. The system model should not impose any constraints on the target system\
    \ ar-\nchitecture if this is not directly implied by the design assumptions. The\
    \ architecture \nshould be the result of system optimization. Therefore, the first\
    \ step in the methodology \nshould be to propose a method for specifying the application\
    \ at the system level. This \nmodel will be the starting point for further design\

    \ tasks). The \nmodel should also target so-called reactive systems, i.e., systems\
    \ in which particular se-\nquences of actions/tasks are activated as a result\
    \ of reactions to specific events.  \n2.2. Mapping Functional Specifications to\
    \ Real-Time IoT Architecture \nIn a typical approach to mapping a system specification\
    \ into a distributed infor-\nmation system architecture, three main steps are\
    \ performed [52]: \n \nResource allocation: At this stage, the target hardware\
    \ architecture of the system is \ndetermined. Resources can be processors, specialized\
    \ hardware modules, and \ncommunication channels (buses, communication processors,\
    \ etc.). At the same time \nas the allocation, the connections between system\
    \ components are determined. \nFigure 1. Sample task graph.\nThere are also a\

    \ if this is not directly implied by the design assumptions. The architecture\n\
    should be the result of system optimization. Therefore, the ﬁrst step in the methodology\n\
    should be to propose a method for specifying the application at the system level.\
    \ This\nmodel will be the starting point for further design (scheduling, mapping\
    \ into architecture,\nand optimization). Therefore, it should contain all the\
    \ information so that the above tasks\ncan be performed. Each method has limitations\
    \ (e.g., the task graph offers no way of\ndescribing the control functionality).\
    \ In the case of RTIoT, the model should allow for\nthe speciﬁcation of both computational\
    \ and transmission tasks (communication tasks).\nThe model should also target\
    \ so-called reactive systems, i.e., systems in which particular\nsequences of\
    \ actions/tasks are activated as a result of reactions to speciﬁc events.\n2.2.\
    \ Mapping Functional Speciﬁcations to Real-Time IoT Architecture\nIn a typical\
    \ approach to mapping a system speciﬁcation into a distributed information\nsystem\
    \ architecture, three main steps are performed [52]:\n•\nResource allocation:\
    \ At this stage, the target hardware architecture of the system\nis determined.\
    \ Resources can be processors, specialized hardware modules, and\ncommunication\
    \ channels (buses, communication processors, etc.). At the same time as\nthe allocation,\
    \ the connections between system components are determined.\n•\nAssignment of\
    \ tasks to resources: This step involves assigning individual tasks to\nresources.\
    \ Tasks are assigned to computing modules, and transmissions are assigned\nto\
    \ communication channels. Task allocation is closely related to resource allocation.\n\
    For specialized resources, only tasks corresponding to the function performed\
    \ by the\nresource can be assigned. Transmissions must only be assigned to communication\n\
    channels between resources with assigned communicating tasks. When two tasks are\n\
    assigned to the same resource, transmissions between them are ignored.\n•\nTask\
    \ prioritization: Task scheduling is necessary to determine the order in which\
    \ tasks are\nperformed when more than one task is assigned to a resource. Scheduling\
    \ must consider\nthe sequential relationships between tasks. During scheduling,\
    \ speed optimization is per-\nformed. In the case of real-time systems, the main\
    \ goal is to arrange the execution of tasks\nElectronics 2022, 11, 4120\n5 of\
    \ 21\nand transmissions in such a way that all timing constraints are met (hard-constrained\n\
    systems) or that timing constraint overruns are minimized (QoS maximization).\n\
    IoT systems are characterized by a speciﬁc architecture, and for this reason,\
    \ it is\nnot possible to directly apply existing methods of synthesizing real-time\
    \ systems to IoT\napplications. The main distinguishing features of these systems\
    \ are:\n•\nA distributed architecture based on internet infrastructure.\n•\nCommunication\
    \ through internet links, thus not ensuring that time constraints are met.\nFrom\
    \ the above-mentioned properties of IoT systems comes the need to develop\na specialized\
    \ method for mapping speciﬁcations to the target architecture, as well as\nthe\
    \ need to develop solutions to ensure the implementation of transmission that\
    \ meets\nreal-time requirements.\n3. Selected Elements of IoT System Architecture\n\
    There are many proposals for IoT system architectures. In order for a given architecture\n\
    to enable the implementation of a real-time system, it must meet certain requirements\
    \ in\nterms of the predictability of operation and the possibility of optimization\
    \ in terms of\nresponse time. This section presents an overview of the various\
    \ elements of the IoT\narchitecture, with a focus on how they can be used in real-time\
    \ systems.\n3.1. Edge and Fog Computing\nToday, the amount of data that are generated\
    \ by IoT systems and then transmitted\nover the network is increasing at a very\
    \ high rate. Therefore, it is important to use the\nthroughput of IoT systems\
    \ as efﬁciently as possible. The concepts of edge computing and\nfog computing\
    \ [53] can be used to optimize this problem. One of the main features of edge\n\
    computing is the clear separation of the physical devices that make up the edge\
    \ infras-\ntructure from the core network devices [54]. Edge devices can perform\
    \ data preprocessing\nfunctions at the network edges, which signiﬁcantly improves\
    \ the ability to maintain the\nrequired transmission time parameters in the context\
    \ of real-time systems. If the tasks per-\nformed by edge devices are subject\
    \ to time constraints, then these devices are implemented\nas real-time embedded\
    \ systems enabling real-time data processing [55,56]. Therefore, it\nis becoming\
    \ increasingly desirable to use edge computing for smart data processing and\n\
    performing speciﬁc optimization tasks [57,58]. The partial ofﬂoading of centralized\
    \ cloud\nsystems is also possible through fog computing mechanisms [59]. Solutions\
    \ of this class\ncan perform services by computation at the level of a distributed,\
    \ decentralized network\ninfrastructure (e.g., using local IoT networks/systems)\
    \ [60]. Fog computing and edge\ncomputing also provide some opportunity to apply\
    \ function virtualization techniques on a\nmassive scale [61–65], which consequently\
    \ reduces the demand for resources and comput-\ning power of a data center. Both\
    \ of the solutions under consideration signiﬁcantly reduce\nthe amount of data\
    \ that must be transmitted and processed by the core network/server\ninfrastructure,\
    \ thus relieving the burden on traditional cloud computing and data center\nsystems.\
    \ If the target resources are less loaded, then it is easier to meet the assumptions\n\
    that guarantee throughput and latency at levels appropriate for real-time solutions\
    \ [66].\nThe primary purpose of edge infrastructure and the use of distributed\
    \ computing is to\nsolve a number of critical tasks affecting the latency, throughput,\
    \ energy consumption,\nand scalability of IoT systems [67]. Moreover, these solutions\
    \ allow for a high degree of\nautonomy in managing the optimal conﬁguration of\
    \ a system [68,69] and increasing the\nlevel of security [70]. All of the above\
    \ aspects favorably affect the ability to implement IoT\nservices with time requirements.\n\
    3.2. Programmable Networks and Virtualization Techniques\nIn the context of real-time\
    \ IoT tasks, new developments in Software-Deﬁned Network-\ning (SDN) and mass-scale\
    \ Network Function Virtualization (NFV) methods are important\nelements to consider.\
    \ SDN networks are commonly associated with IoT technology because\nthe architecture\
    \ provides a more ﬂexible and manageable environment. In addition, more\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 4120\n6 of 21\nand more research (for example, on blockchain) is focused\
    \ on implementing solutions\nthat combine SDN and IoT technologies with NFV methods.\
    \ Therefore, it is anticipated\nthat NFV will be a very important tool to support\
    \ the automation of network solutions,\nincluding in real-time transmission issues.\n\
    In SDN, management tasks are separated from data transmission tasks. In this ap-\n\
    proach, network devices solely act as relays that transmit sequentially routed\
    \ packets\nfrom the source to the destination, with all policies in place for\
    \ both communication and\nsecurity [71]. The management space in SDN is a highly\
    \ centralized area, while the data\nspace operates on a distributed plane. Potential\
    \ SDN applications related to real-time\ntransmission are shown in [72], where\
    \ a four-tier cloudlet architecture (based on SDN) in\ncombination with a WBAN\
    \ (Wireless Body Area Network) architecture was described. The\npaper described\
    \ a cloudlet—a mobile, cloud-based data center system that is located at\nthe\
    \ edge of the network. This approach was shown to enable efﬁcient trafﬁc processing,\n\
    optimal resource utilization, and reduced latency, which is of great importance\
    \ for real-time\nsystems. The approach proposes that all network controllers be\
    \ located in a cloudlet,\nresulting in better optimization in terms of QoS mechanisms,\
    \ as well as a complete view\nof the network. On the other hand, the authors of\
    \ [73] proposed the concept of a three-\nlayer SDN application based on a WBAN\
    \ scheme called an SDWBAN (Software-Deﬁned\nWireless Body Area Network). In this\
    \ solution, network trafﬁc prioritization is performed.\nHigher-priority packets\
    \ are analyzed and sent through the network ﬁrst, which is made\npossible by optimal\
    \ resource allocation (e.g., throughput), path allocation and the use of\ncloud\
    \ computing. In this case, transmission latency is reduced by formulating a heuristic\n\
    allocation model for minimizing the service time of individual services. Security\
    \ issues\nfor IoT systems are also an important issue. In this area, solutions\
    \ using SDN are known,\nsuch as artiﬁcial intelligence mechanisms that automatically\
    \ analyze network trafﬁc while\ntaking real-time transmission requirements into\
    \ account [74].\nIn today’s vast IT world, technology is beginning to play an\
    \ increasingly important\nrole in the move away from physical infrastructure building\
    \ and solutions based on dedi-\ncated physical network devices to virtualization\
    \ technology. An example of virtualization\ntechnology in relation to the IoT\
    \ area is the NFV solution. The implementation of virtual-\nization technology\
    \ in IoT solutions provides ﬂexibility for applications regardless of the\nplatform\
    \ on which this solution is based or built while maintaining the full management\n\
    of logical network functions and the modeling of the full technology stack. An\
    \ additional\nadvantage of implementing NFV technology in IoT solutions is the\
    \ ability to fully manage\nand conﬁgure individual virtualized network elements\
    \ at all levels (from physical machines\nto virtualized machines to sublime network\
    \ services) [75]. From the point of view of the\nIoT and real-time requirements,\
    \ the use of NFV virtualization technology has begun to play\na key role due to\
    \ the requirements of real-time transmission, i.e., transmission with the\nshortest\
    \ possible packet delivery and processing time while maintaining an appropriate\n\
    QoS and meeting the deadline value requirements of individual packets [76]. The\
    \ biggest\nadvantage of virtualization technology is its versatility in application\
    \ to various IoT archi-\ntectures, although due to its deﬁnition and similar mechanisms,\
    \ NFV technology perfectly\ncomplements IoT solutions based on the SDN model architecture.\n\
    3.3. Real-Time Database Systems\nTo ensure the best possible QoS performance in\
    \ real-time transmission, the solutions\ndescribed in the previous sections are\
    \ crucial from the points of view of hardware technolo-\ngies and transmission\
    \ and data processing concepts. At the same time, as the data volume\ngenerated\
    \ by IoT systems continues to grow, there is also a steady increase in the need\
    \ for\nsolutions to store that data while supporting mechanisms that consider\
    \ real-time require-\nments [77]. One of the directions is the concept “fast data”,\
    \ which involves developing\ndatabase technology to ensure the fastest possible\
    \ execution of queries. Examples of such\ndatabases are Druid [78] and Volt Active\
    \ Data [79].\nElectronics 2022, 11, 4120\n7 of 21\nSome of the most well-known\
    \ approaches for storing large datasets are SDDS (Scal-\nable Distributed Data\
    \ Structure) structures, which enable the virtualization of distributed\nmemory\
    \ by aggregating resources at network nodes [80]. Considering real-time require-\n\
    ments and the need for QoS parameters, an extension of this concept in this direction\
    \ are\nSDDS LH/RP (Scalable Distributed Data Structure Linear Hashing/Range Partitioning)\
    \ ap-\nproaches dedicated to real-time cloud applications [81]. An SDDS server\
    \ schedules queries\nusing real-time queuing methods that consider importance\
    \ attributes, which enables the\nachievement of a higher level of execution of\
    \ queries in a certain time in the case of SDDS\nLH/RP approaches than in the\
    \ case of FIFO (First In, First Out) queuing approaches [82].\nWith such an implementation,\
    \ QoS metrics in real-time IoT systems can be signiﬁcantly\nimproved [83]. The\
    \ steady increase in demand for big data processing environments has\nled to the\
    \ development of more dedicated data storage models, such as NoSQL [84] and\n\
    NewSQL [85]. These IoT system solutions are beginning to gain value from the point\
    \ of\nview of time requirements due to the need to address the processing of large\
    \ volumes of\ndata while maintaining QoS parameters.\nIn terms of real-time database\
    \ systems, issues remain to be addressed in terms of\nensuring that hard real-time\
    \ policies are met for queries that update data that are already\nrecorded/stored\
    \ and for bucket splitting operations [86,87].\n4. Task/Transmission Scheduling\
    \ and Communication Protocols\nThe real-time system design methodology proposed\
    \ in this paper assumes the appro-\npriate scheduling of calculations and transmissions.\
    \ In classic system solutions, schedul-\ning can be implemented through FIFO queuing\
    \ or other static or dynamic scheduling\nmethods [88]. Static scheduling methods\
    \ are mainly concerned with the design of embed-\nded systems, which are most\
    \ often used to control various devices when there are time\nconstraints. These\
    \ systems feature a dedicated architecture and perform predetermined\nfunctions.\
    \ Therefore, it is possible to estimate the execution time of each function and\
    \ to\nperform a ranking, ensuring that all time constraints are met. IoT systems\
    \ can be viewed as\na generalization of embedded systems with a distributed architecture.\
    \ The main difference\nis the communication between system components. In the\
    \ case of embedded systems, the\ncomponents are directly connected and the transmission\
    \ time is predetermined. In the\ncase of IoT systems, transmission time also depends\
    \ on other factors, e.g., on the trafﬁc\nand throughput of links and on the route\
    \ determined by routing processes. Thus, it is not\npossible to directly apply\
    \ known static task scheduling methods to IoT systems, though\nthese methods can\
    \ be considered from the point of view of ensuring optimal cooperation\nwith relevant\
    \ communication protocols. Therefore, this section examines the scheduling\nmethods\
    \ and selected communication protocols used in data transmission tasks that assume\n\
    the need to meet real-time assumptions.\n4.1. FIFO\nDepending on the application,\
    \ FIFO queuing mechanisms can be implemented as a\nhardware sliding register or\
    \ using different memory structures. Such solutions often use\nnetwork devices\
    \ such as switches or routers. These devices queue data packets as they\ntravel\
    \ from source to destination. Typically, one FIFO structure is used per connection\
    \ [89].\nSome network devices also have multiple FIFO structures/implementations\
    \ for the simulta-\nneous and independent queuing of different types of data.\
    \ Most software implementations\nof FIFO queuing do not meet security conditions\
    \ and require an additional security mecha-\nnism to verify the chain of data\
    \ structures [90]. Achieving good performance in terms of\nthroughput and scalability\
    \ while maintaining a high level of security in IoT systems has\nalways been a\
    \ major challenge. The packet queuing process strategy represented by the\nFIFO\
    \ algorithm contributed to the later development of algorithms such as SAGA-PBFT\n\
    (Security-Aware Genetic Algorithm-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance),\
    \ which was\ndeveloped on the basis of the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)\
    \ algorithm. The\nElectronics 2022, 11, 4120\n8 of 21\nSAGA-PBFT algorithm is\
    \ used in solutions such as the block chain, where security aspects\nand transmission\
    \ time requirements are extremely important [91].\n4.2. Static and Dynamic Task\
    \ Scheduling Methods in Real-Time Systems\nStatic task scheduling algorithms assume\
    \ that before the target scheduling process, a\nset of input tasks is processed\
    \ according to one of the speciﬁed sorting rules. These rules\ndeﬁne how the input\
    \ task array is sorted. With this approach, it is possible to determine\nwhich\
    \ packages, criteria, or parameters in the IoT architecture will have the highest\
    \ priority\nat the outset. Static task scheduling algorithms include LS (List\
    \ Scheduling) mechanisms.\nIn this group, we can distinguish the following sorting\
    \ rules: LPT (Longest Processing\nTime), SPT (Shortest Processing Time), and RPT\
    \ (Reverse Processing Time). In this case,\nthe drawback of using list scheduling\
    \ in real-time solutions is the additional overhead\nof executing the processes\
    \ implemented in the sorting rules before the data packet is\nforwarded to the\
    \ next network layers. This adversely affects packet delivery times, so\nmeeting\
    \ the goals of RTIoT solutions is difﬁcult to implement [92]. Another popular\
    \ static\ntask scheduling algorithm is the Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) method.\
    \ This algorithm\nassigns priorities to individual tasks before they begin execution\
    \ that do not change during\nthe algorithm’s run time. Priorities are assigned\
    \ to each task by taking the frequency of their\nappearance into account (the\
    \ task with the shortest period will have the highest priority).\nRMS is typically\
    \ used to schedule single-processor tasks [93], which is a major limitation of\n\
    it for the design of extended RTIoT solutions. On the other hand, its expropriation\
    \ feature\n(the highest priority task is performed) is decent in terms of maintaining\
    \ the best possible\nQoS performance and meeting real-time conditions.\nFor dynamic\
    \ scheduling in the context of the research presented in this article, it is\n\
    worth considering the EDF (Earliest Deadline First) and LLF (Least Laxity First)\
    \ algorithms.\nReal-time systems distinguish between two types of input data.\
    \ The ﬁrst type comprises\ndata generated over certain ﬁxed periods of time (e.g.,\
    \ trafﬁc resulting from the functionality\nof the communication protocols used),\
    \ and the second type comprises data generated as\na result of actual events (e.g.,\
    \ data from various types of sensors). In IoT systems, which\ndeal with data generated\
    \ as a result of interactions taking place, the EDF algorithm [46]\nmay ﬁnd application\
    \ in scheduling processes. In this solution, the value referred to as the\ndeadline\
    \ for each task is taken as the priority value, so the lower it is, the closer\
    \ the deadline\nfor a given task is. An additional advantage of the EDF algorithm\
    \ over others is its good\nutilization of CPU resources and fairly fast response\
    \ times, which, from the point of view of\ndesigning real-time IoT systems, can\
    \ have key roles in ensuring adequate QoS parameters\nand other real-time requirements.\
    \ Another example of a dynamic scheduling algorithm\nthat can ﬁnd application\
    \ in a real-time IoT system is the LLF algorithm. It uses the deadline\nvalue,\
    \ which, along with the time left to complete a given task, is used to calculate\
    \ the laxity\nparameter used to prioritize the execution of individual tasks.\
    \ In this case, the lower the\nvalue of laxity, the higher priority the task will\
    \ be and the faster it should be completed [94].\nA certain disadvantage of this\
    \ algorithm is when there are many tasks with the same or\nsimilar laxity value\
    \ simultaneously, the demand for computing power increases [95]. This\nrepresents\
    \ a kind of limitation from the point of view of applications for RTIoT systems,\n\
    since one of the priorities of IoT systems is to optimize their energy intensity\
    \ [96]. On the\nother hand, however, the advantages of this algorithm include\
    \ resistance to overloading, to\nwhich systems using the EDF algorithm are prone,\
    \ which translates into the possibility of\nusing it in the design and implementation\
    \ of real-time systems [83]. Considering the above,\nit can be concluded that\
    \ both EDF and LLF can be used for certain tasks in the design and\nimplementation\
    \ of RTIoT solutions.\n4.3. Communication Protocols\nIn real-time IoT systems,\
    \ in addition to the described task scheduling techniques, the\nuse of appropriate\
    \ types of transmission media and the implementation of proper com-\nmunication\
    \ protocols, with particular emphasis on routing protocols, also play important\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 4120\n9 of 21\nroles. Some well-known routing protocols\
    \ to consider when designing RTIoT solutions\nare: RSTP (Real Time Streaming Protocol),\
    \ WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication),\nXMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence\
    \ Protocol), MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry\nTransport), CoAP (Constrained Application\
    \ Protocol), WebSocket, and 6LoWPAN (IPv6\nover Low-Power Wireless Personal Area\
    \ Networks).\nThe RSTP is an application layer protocol for the control, transmission\
    \ and delivery of\ndata while maintaining real-time transmission criteria. The\
    \ most common implementations\nof this protocol are systems used to transmit voice\
    \ and video in real time. Data are\ncontinuously delivered, even when RTSP requests\
    \ are not received by the server. A new\narea in which this protocol is being\
    \ applied is the technology area of the teaching of\nlanguage, which includes\
    \ listening, speaking, reading and writing [97]. Another protocol\nimplemented\
    \ in real-time IoT systems is WebRTC. Its most common applications are\nsolutions\
    \ for transmitting video images or streaming data in the broadest sense while\n\
    achieving the lowest possible levels of latency and data transmission loss, as\
    \ exempliﬁed by\napplications for voice transmission and videoconferencing. Research\
    \ [98] conducted in the\narea of the WebRTC protocol indicates that it yields\
    \ better response times and connection\nstabilization times in web applications\
    \ compared with other streaming protocols such\nas the RTSP [99]. In addition,\
    \ from the point of view of QoS parameters and energy\nconsumption, the implementation\
    \ of the WebRTC protocol allows one to achieve better\nvalues, which translates\
    \ into meeting the real-time transmission requirements of solutions\nimplemented\
    \ in IoT systems. The XMPP protocol, on the other hand, is based on XML [100].\n\
    The protocol is commonly available and can be freely modiﬁed, and many XMPP servers\n\
    are available [101]. This translates into its main use being implementations in\
    \ systems\nand applications for exchanging text-based content such as popular\
    \ instant messaging\napplications. The simplest and lightest protocol for real-time\
    \ data transmission is the MQTT\nprotocol, which is based on the publish/subscribe\
    \ pattern. It is designed for transmission\nfor devices that do not require a\
    \ high throughput. By limiting the transmission speed, the\nprotocol provides\
    \ a greater reliability. The protocol is perfect for IoT machine-to-machine\n\
    connections, mobile devices, and where throughput and energy savings are required.\
    \ By\nusing this protocol, one can easily transfer data during a conversation\
    \ from one device\nto another and continue the conversation [102]. An example\
    \ of a protocol that uses the\nUDP protocol for communication and is also applicable\
    \ to RTIoT systems is the CoAP\nprotocol. It has been optimized for constrained\
    \ devices and networks (used in wireless\nsensor networks) [103]. The CoAP protocol\
    \ extends the paradigm of ubiquitous web\nservices in mobile applications to IoT\
    \ and M2M solutions, which can then be developed\nusing shared and reusable RESTful\
    \ web services. In doing so, this protocol considers\nIoT constraints and requirements\
    \ or QoS requirements [104]. A two-way data exchange\nchannel over a single TCP\
    \ connection is provided by the WebSocket protocol. The protocol\nis designed\
    \ to operate on ports 80 and 443, similarly to HTTP, allowing for interactions\n\
    between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server at a lower\
    \ load\nthan alternatives while making it much easier to transfer real-time data\
    \ to and from the\nserver, which is an asset when considering its use in IoT systems\
    \ [105]. Thanks to the\npreviously mentioned interactions between the web browser\
    \ and the server, the protocol\nhas found applications in the development of online\
    \ games, particularly [106]. With the\ndevelopment of technology, the need for\
    \ IPv4 address allocation has gradually increased,\nwhich has contributed to basically\
    \ exhausting the entire pool of this addressing. In response\nto the introduction\
    \ of the new IPv6 addressing standard and the need to handle packets\ncontaining\
    \ such addresses, the 6LowPAN routing protocol, which is characterized by a\n\
    low power consumption, was created. The shortcomings of this protocol include\
    \ the large\nsize of the header relative to the data themselves; from the point\
    \ of view of application\nconsiderations, the implementation of this protocol\
    \ in RTIoT solutions can contribute to\nan increase in the level of latency or\
    \ packet loss with a direct impact on the deterioration\nof QoS parameters. Today,\
    \ further research is underway to address the challenges of the\n6LowPAN protocol,\
    \ which include fragmentation, header compression and security [107].\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 4120\n10 of 21\n5. RTIoT System Design Methodology\nThe implementation\
    \ of the functional model of the real-time system proposed in\nSection 2 requires\
    \ the implementation of selected elements included in the IoT solution\narchitecture.\
    \ Typical IoT systems primarily consist of sensors providing data to the system,\n\
    end devices (usually also equipped with sensors), a server application, and a\
    \ client appli-\ncation [5]. The sensors can be directly connected to the server\
    \ via internet links or can be\nan integral part of the end device. Indirectly,\
    \ there may also be edge devices whose job is\nto pre-process data. Communication\
    \ is usually carried out via low-energy technologies\nsuch as BLE (Bluetooth Low\
    \ Energy) [108], ZigBee [109], and LoRaWAN (Long Range\nWide Area Network) [110].\
    \ End devices using sensors communicate with an IoT system\nvia internet links.\
    \ They can also include actuators and controllers, so an IoT system can\nremotely\
    \ control such devices. Server applications are usually installed in cloud computing\n\
    or on a dedicated server, while the client applications used to operate the system\
    \ can come\nin the form of mobile, desktop or web applications. All of the aforementioned\
    \ components\ncommunicate using the relevant protocols.\nIn the case of real-time\
    \ systems, there is a time limit on obtaining a response, which\nmeans that once\
    \ a request is sent, a response is expected to be obtained within an assumed\n\
    maximum time (deadline). Exceeding this time can be treated as an error (systems\
    \ with\nhard constraints) or as a reduction in service quality (systems with soft\
    \ constraints) [111].\nRequests can be sent by either end devices or server or\
    \ client applications. In order to\nreduce the occurrence of the aforementioned\
    \ errors or to maintain the required level of\nquality of service in IoT systems,\
    \ one can use the solutions described earlier, such as edge\ncomputing, fog computing,\
    \ SDN, NFV, real-time databases, scheduling methods, and\nrelevant communication\
    \ protocols. These elements are described in Sections 3 and 4 of this\narticle,\
    \ and based on them, an illustrative architecture for a real-time IoT system can\
    \ be\nproposed, as shown in Figure 2. In the architecture, the following computing\
    \ layers that\ncan perform various tasks of the IoT system can be distinguished:\n\
    •\nSensor and actuator layer (SL): the layer consisting the interface between\
    \ an IoT system\nand its environment that enables the collection of data from\
    \ the environment and the\ncontrol of the elements of the environment.\n•\nEdge\
    \ layer (EL) (optional): an intermediate layer that enables the distributed process-\n\
    ing of data without the need to send them to a central system server.\n•\nCloud\
    \ layer (CL): the layer that contains the system’s servers and databases and that\n\
    usually controls the operation of the entire system.\n•\nUser layer (UL): the\

    \ for designing an RTIoT system is a system speciﬁcation in the form\nof an attributed\
    \ set of task graphs. Each task graph describes one function of the system.\n\
    The following attributes are deﬁned for each graph:\n•\nMaximum frequency of graph\
    \ activation: This attribute speciﬁes the maximum fre-\nquency of appearance of\
    \ input events that cause the execution of functions represented\nby a given TG.\n\
    •\nMaximum number of TG instances: This attribute speciﬁes the maximum number\
    \ of\nsimultaneous instances of the task graph. This corresponds to the maximum\
    \ number\nof simultaneous events that cause the activation of the functions described\
    \ by the TG.\n•\nA set of time constraints: The time constraints are associated\
    \ with the selected paths\nin the task graph and deﬁne the maximum time in which\
    \ all tasks must be completed\nfrom the activation of the task that starts the\
    \ path to the completion of the task that\nends the path.\n•\nFor each task, an\
    \ attribute is speciﬁed that assigns the task to a speciﬁc layer of the\narchitecture.\
    \ This attribute is deﬁned by the designer.\nExample task graphs are shown in\
    \ Figures 3–6. These graphs describe nine basic\nfunctions of a smart city system\
    \ for managing parking spaces. Figure 3 shows a user-\nactivated task graph for\
    \ the following system functionalities: searching for the parking\nspace closest\
    \ to the user’s current location, the function of ﬁnding the user’s car in the\n\

    \ (T0_03), the end user enters data/criteria for the search \nfunction, such as\
    \ city and street (T0_12). The user also has the ability to download in-\nformation\
    \ on weather conditions (T0_17). In the next step (T0_5), the central server (a\
    \ \ndedicated cloud application running in the CL layer) receives queries from\
    \ the UL layer \nand starts the processes necessary to perform the called functions.\
    \ For example, data-\nFigure 6. Task graph for the problem of collecting/updating\
    \ data on weather conditions.\nFor all system functionality, the starting point,\
    \ or trigger (T0_0), is the end-user activity\nin a dedicated application made\
    \ by selecting the appropriate function at the UL layer\nlevel. Depending on the\
    \ selected function, a further sequence of events follows. When\nthe user selects\
    \ the parking space search function (T0_1), the user’s current location is\nretrieved\
    \ using the GPS module (T0_4). If the car search function (T0_2) is selected,\
    \ the user\nmust enter the license plate number of the searched vehicle (T0_10)\
    \ into the application.\nOn the other hand, when the function of reserving a free\
    \ parking space is selected from\nthe user’s application (T0_03), the end user\
    \ enters data/criteria for the search function,\nsuch as city and street (T0_12).\
    \ The user also has the ability to download information\non weather conditions\
    \ (T0_17). In the next step (T0_5), the central server (a dedicated\ncloud application\
    \ running in the CL layer) receives queries from the UL layer and starts\nthe\
    \ processes necessary to perform the called functions. For example, databases\
    \ can be\nsearched to ﬁnd free parking spaces while considering information from\
    \ the GPS tracker. A\nsearch for license plate numbers can be run, along with\
    \ the retrieval of the vehicle location\ndata assigned to them (parking/parking\
    \ space number). Taking the user’s criteria into\naccount, free parking spaces\
    \ can be searched for, or the fee due can be calculated based on\nthe time the\
    \ parking space is occupied and the parking rate for the given parking space.\
    \ The\n(T0_6) task runs functions in the user application responsible for receiving\
    \ and processing\ndata coming from the CL layer. In the next step, the user, based\
    \ on the generated data,\nselects a parking space by activating the “Reserve”\
    \ function (T0_7); in turn, for the process\nof searching for a car based on the\
    \ entered license plate number (T0_10), the end result is\nthe presentation of\
    \ the results of the query processing in the end-user application (T0_11) or\n\
    the start of the payment process using a debit/credit card or bank transfer (T0_14).\
    \ It is also\npossible to visualize data on weather conditions (T0_18). Once the\
    \ task is completed (T0_7),\nthe server-level procedure for processing a parking\
    \ space reservation request (T0_8) is\nstarted, and the state of the sensor is\
    \ changed; this is realized, for example, by changing the\ncolor of the marking\
    \ of a given space from green to red (T0_9). The task (T0_14) is followed\nby\
    \ the payment process through data exchange with the bank/payment card architecture\n\
    (T0_15). At the end of this path, the result is received in the form of information\
    \ on the\npayment in progress (T0_16).\nFigure 4 shows a task graph for the functionality\
    \ of monitoring and updating the\nstatus of individual parking spaces.\nThe starting\
    \ point/trigger for system function aimed at monitoring or managing\nparking spaces\
    \ is to register a change in sensor state/status (T1_0) at the sensor (sensor)\n\
    layer level. Then, via the network infrastructure, such information is transmitted\
    \ to the\nservers that make up the parking system (T1_1). In the next step (T1_2),\
    \ the central\nserver (a dedicated cloud application running at the CL layer)\
    \ receives queries from the\nEL layer and runs the processes necessary to execute\
    \ the called functions—in this case, a\nfunction to update the database with the\
    \ latest parking sensor states/statuses. In order\nElectronics 2022, 11, 4120\n\
    14 of 21\nfor the process to be considered successful, the end result at the edge\
    \ layer is to run\na procedure that receives a conﬁrmation of the completion of\
    \ cloud processing for the\ndatabase update (T1_3).\nFigure 5 presents a task\
    \ graph for the following functionalities: the function of reserv-\ning an available\
    \ parking space for given time criteria (T2_1) and the function of plotting a\n\
    route leading to a vehicle in the parking lot (T2_2). As for the task graph in\
    \ Figure 3, the\ntrigger for these functionalities is also the end-user activity\
    \ of selecting the appropriate\nfunction from the user application (T2_0). Depending\
    \ on the user’s selection of a speciﬁc\nfunction, they may be prompted in the\
    \ next step of the process to provide the data necessary\nto perform the search\
    \ function (T2_3). If the function of routing to a vehicle is implemented,\nthe\
    \ results of calling the cloud processing presentation function may be displayed\
    \ in the\nuser’s application (T2_9). In the next step (T2_4) the central server\
    \ (a dedicated cloud appli-\ncation running in the CL layer) receives queries\
    \ from the UL layer and starts the processes\nnecessary to perform the called\
    \ functions. For example, a database can be searched for\nfree parking spaces\
    \ given the criteria set by the user or a process can be run to search the\ndatabase\
    \ to determine the location of a vehicle with a speciﬁc license plate number.\
    \ Then,\nthe function responsible for receiving and processing data coming from\
    \ the CL layer (T2_5)\nis run in the user’s application. In the next step, based\
    \ on the generated data, the user\nselects a parking space by running the reservation\
    \ function (T2_6). Alternatively, from\nthe user’s application level, a function\
    \ for the presentation of the results of cloud query\nprocessing (T2_9) is run.\
    \ After the task (T2_6) is completed, the procedure for processing a\nparking\
    \ reservation request (T2_7) is started from the EL layer. The next step could\
    \ be a\ntask to start the navigation function in the user’s application interface\
    \ (T2_10). Finally, a\nchange in the state of the sensor is made; this can be\
    \ visualized, for example, by changing\nthe color of the marking of the given\
    \ parking space from green to red (T2_8). For another\nprocess, it could be running\
    \ a function designed to retrieve current position data from a\nGPS module.\n\
    The last graph shows the tasks for the functionality of reading and processing\
    \ informa-\ntion on the value of the outdoor temperature, as well as reading and\
    \ processing information\non the state of atmospheric pressure.\nSimilar to the\
    \ task graph shown in Figure 4, the tasks described for the problem of\ncollecting/updating\
    \ data on weather conditions also have sensor readings (T3_0) as the\nstarting\
    \ point/trigger for system operation. Then, through the network infrastructure,\
    \ the\ntemperature (T3_1) or the atmospheric pressure (T3_2) information is transmitted\
    \ to the\nservers that make up the CL layer level of the system. In the next step\
    \ (T3_3), the central\nserver receives queries from the EL layer and starts the\
    \ processes necessary to perform the\ncalled functions. Processes can be considered\
    \ successfully completed when the end result\nat the EL layer is the launch of\
    \ a procedure that receives conﬁrmation of the completion of\ncloud processing\
    \ for database updates (T3_4).\n5.2. Mapping Speciﬁcations to RTIoT System Architecture\n\
    The assignment of tasks to the RTIoT architecture layer is performed by the designer\n\
    at the system speciﬁcation stage. The next step is to map the speciﬁcations to\
    \ the different\nlayers of the RTIoT architecture. Figure 7 shows the results\
    \ of the speciﬁcation mapping\nintroduced in Section 5.1.\nFor simplicity, only\
    \ one instance of each graph was assumed. This corresponds to a\nsystem with one\
    \ user and single sensors (one parking lot and one parking space). In a real\n\
    system, one instance is created for each user and one instance is created for\
    \ each sensor\nthat can activate the TG. For this purpose, it is necessary to\
    \ assume the maximum load on\nthe system, i.e., the maximum number of simultaneous\
    \ users and the maximum number of\nparking lots and stands served by the system.\
    \ For clarity, the ﬁgure also does not indicate\ntransmission volumes and time\
    \ constraints. Based on the mapping, it is possible to obtain\ninformation about\
    \ the transmissions between the layers and the sequence dependencies\nbetween\
    \ these transmissions. For example, there may be 10 transmissions between the\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 4120\n15 of 21\nUL and CL layers: T0_4→T0_5, T0_10→T0_5,\
    \ T0_12→T0_5, T0_17→T0_5, T0_5→T0_6,\nT0_14→T0_15, T0_15→T0_16, T2_3→T2_4, T2_9→T2_4,\
    \ and T2_4→T2_5. It can also be\nnoted that there are sequence dependencies between\
    \ some transmissions, which means\nthat these transmissions will not compete with\
    \ each other for the communication link. This\nis important information from the\
    \ point of view of transmission scheduling.\n \ng p\ngg\ny\np\ng\ntemperature\
    \ (T3_1) or the atmospheric pressure (T3_2) information is transmitted to the\
    \ \nservers that make up the CL layer level of the system. In the next step (T3_3),\
    \ the central \nserver receives queries from the EL layer and starts the processes\
    \ necessary to perform \nthe called functions. Processes can be considered successfully\
    \ completed when the end \nresult at the EL layer is the launch of a procedure\
    \ that receives confirmation of the com-\npletion of cloud processing for database\
    \ updates (T3_4). \n5.2. Mapping Specifications to RTIoT System Architecture \n\
    The assignment of tasks to the RTIoT architecture layer is performed by the designer\
    \ \nat the system specification stage. The next step is to map the specifications\
    \ to the different \nlayers of the RTIoT architecture. Figure 7 shows the results\
    \ of the specification mapping \nintroduced in Section 5.1. \n \nFigure 7. Mapping\
    \ the described processes to RTIoT system architecture. \nFigure 7. Mapping the\
    \ described processes to RTIoT system architecture.\nAssuming the maximum frequency\
    \ of activation of individual tasks and the size\nof individual transmissions,\
    \ it is possible to estimate the throughput requirements of\ncommunication links.\
    \ These requirements can be reduced by appropriately scheduling\ntransmissions\
    \ so that time-constrained transmissions are executed in an order that ensures\n\
    the maximum QoS.\n5.3. RTIoT System Optimization\nIn the RTIoT system, each function,\
    \ represented by a task graph, can be simultaneously\nactivated by different sources\
    \ (users and sensors). This can be represented by multiple\ninstances of a given\
    \ graph. When designing an RTIoT system, one speciﬁes the requirements\nfor the\
    \ system by identifying the following constraints:\n•\nMaximum number of instances\
    \ of a given graph: This parameter determines the\nmaximum load on the system\
    \ in terms of the number of simultaneously activated tasks.\nElectronics 2022,\
    \ 11, 4120\n16 of 21\n•\nMaximum processing time (deadline): This parameter speciﬁes\
    \ the maximum time\nthat can elapse from the start of the tstart task to the completion\
    \ of the tstop task. For\na given system, there can be multiple time constraints\
    \ that deﬁne different paths in\ntask graphs. For soft-real-time systems, a soft\
    \ constraint is deﬁned as ds\nmax and a hard\nconstraint is deﬁned as dh\nmax.\n\
    The goal of optimizing RTIoT systems is to achieve the highest possible QoS. The\
    \ QoS\nfor a single constraint can be deﬁned as:\nQoSi =\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nif\
    \ ti > dh\nmax\n1\nif ti < ds\nmax\n1 −\nti−ds\nmax\ndh\nmax−ds\nmax\nin other\
    \ cases\n(1)\nwhere ti is the current execution time of tasks covered by the i-th\
    \ constraint.\nThen, the total QoS for the system can be determined as the average\
    \ value of all QoSi:\nQoS =\nn\n∑\ni=0\nQoSi\nn\n(2)\nwhere n is the number of\
    \ all constraints in all instances of task graphs.\nWhile intending to obtain\
    \ the highest possible QoS value, the optimization of the\nsystem consists in\
    \ prioritizing the execution of tasks and transmissions in such a way as to\n\
    minimize any exceedance of time constrains. For this purpose, the scheduling methods\n\
    described in Section 4 can be used. However, in order to be able to perform tasks\
    \ and\ntransmissions according to the optimized prioritization, it is necessary\
    \ to consider the\nfollowing properties of the RTIoT architecture:\n•\nTransmissions\
    \ are carried out over shared internet links: To ensure predictable trans-\nmission\
    \ times, it is necessary to develop routing methods that consider the required\n\
    order and priority of transmissions.\n•\nIndividual tasks and transmissions are\
    \ assigned to resources distributed over the\ninternet. Therefore, in order to\
    \ execute them in the required order, it is necessary\nto use time synchronization\
    \ mechanisms. This can be accomplished by developing\nappropriate communication\
    \ protocols.\nAssuming that the aforementioned solutions are available, the presented\
    \ methodology\ncan enable the automatic synthesis of QoS-optimized RTIoT systems.\
    \ The quality of a given\nsolution is evaluated by calculating the QoS value deﬁned\
    \ by Equation (2). This value\nis calculated for the worst-case scenario, i.e.,\
    \ assuming the maximum system load and\nmaximum computation and transmission times.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nThis article presents a methodology for designing RTIoT systems\
    \ that includes the\nfollowing elements:\n•\nFour-layer generic RTIoT system architecture\
    \ model.\n•\nFunctional speciﬁcation method in the form of a set of task graphs\
    \ with assignment of\ntasks to IoT architecture layers.\n•\nA method for mapping\
    \ functional speciﬁcations into an RTIoT system architecture.\n•\nRequirements\
    \ for communication protocols and routing methods used in RTIoT systems.\nFor\
    \ the proposed RTIoT architecture model, a method is presented to ensure that\n\
    the functional speciﬁcation is mapped into an optimized IoT architecture. The\
    \ starting\npoint is the speciﬁcation of the functions of a given system in the\
    \ form of task graphs.\nFor each task, their assignment to the different layers\
    \ of the IoT architecture and time\nconstraints are speciﬁed. The speciﬁcation\
    \ is then mapped into the target architecture\nby globally prioritizing tasks\
    \ and transmissions. The scheduling method optimizes the\nschedule to achieve\
    \ the highest possible QoS. The presented methodology is based on\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 4120\n17 of 21\nanalogous methodologies used in the synthesis of embedded\
    \ systems. However, due to\nthe nature of the IoT architecture, it was necessary\
    \ to consider speciﬁc features of the\nIoT architecture such as the lack of the\
    \ centralized control of all elements of the system,\nthe sharing of communication\
    \ and computing infrastructure with other systems, and\nthe dynamic number of\
    \ tasks in the system. This paper also provides an overview of\nexisting methods\
    \ and technologies relevant to RTIoT systems. The purpose of this review\nwas\
    \ to present current solutions that can be applied to RTIoT systems, as well as\
    \ to\nindicate the missing elements that require development in order to create\
    \ a complete design\nenvironment for RTIoT systems. In this way, this paper can\
    \ also be a valuable resource for\ndesigners and others interested in RTIoT.\n\
    The proposed methodology was illustrated with an example of designing a practical\n\
    RTIoT system that performs the functions of a smart system for handling a city’s\
    \ parking\nlots. The example demonstrated the practical usefulness of the proposed\
    \ methodology in\nthe design and optimization of RTIoT systems. To the best of\
    \ our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst\npaper to present a complete methodology for\
    \ the design of a broad class of RTIoT systems\nwhile considering the QoS optimization\
    \ of such systems.\nFurther work will involve the development of routing methods\
    \ and communication\nprotocols to enable the implementation of systems designed\
    \ according to the method-\nology presented in this work. The result will be a\
    \ complete RTIoT system design and\nimplementation environment that ensures the\
    \ creation of systems with a high level of QoS.\nAuthor Contributions: S.D.: conceptualization,\

    \ many data transfer protocols are used for various tasks. In this article, we\
    \ consider the application layer\nprotocols that are the main ones for transmitting\
    \ messages in the IoT. Te main problems are unpredictability, lack of stability\
    \ of\ndata transmission delays, and non-determinism, which are also important\
    \ for real-time systems. Te purpose of this study is to\ndetermine the most appropriate\
    \ middleware and data transfer protocol for systems with high data transfer requirements,\
    \ in-\ncluding real-time systems. Terefore, MQTT, RTPS, JMS, and AMQP protocols\
    \ were analyzed in order to fnd out what tasks these\nprotocols should be used\
    \ for and whether they can be used in robotic and autonomous systems where high\
    \ data transmission\nrequirements are imposed. To evaluate the protocols, the\
    \ standards were analyzed to determine the pros and cons, and the\nsoftware implementations\
    \ of each of them were selected. To assess the characteristics of data transmission,\
    \ we have developed our\nown test scenarios that simulate complex situations.\
    \ Te behavior of software solutions is analyzed and a comparative analysis is\n\
    made based on the obtained data. Together, the theoretical analysis of protocols\
    \ and the study of software solutions allow us to\nconclude on the applicability\
    \ of a particular protocol in real-time systems. As a result of the study, we\
    \ can conclude that RTPS is\nthe best solution for real-time systems with diferent\
    \ trafc and MQTTperforms well when transmitting short messages. But none\nof the\
    \ protocols under consideration guarantees the determinism of data transmission,\
    \ so it is better to use specialized link-layer\nprotocols to obtain guarantees.\n\
    1. Introduction\nIn modern systems, the volume of data processed, generated,\n\
    and transmitted is increasing. Many complex systems\nconsist of many modules or\
    \ nodes that constantly com-\nmunicate with each other. Tese modules can be located\
    \ on a\nsingle computer or distributed in a network. Te more\nautomated the system,\
    \ the greater the requirements for data\ntransmission and real-time communication.\
    \ In distributed\ncomputing systems, transmission afects the performance of\n\
    the system, while in various robotic systems, constant\nsynchronization may be\
    \ required and low data exchange\nrates may lead to errors in the operation or\
    \ breakage of\nmechanisms. While in autonomous systems such as self-\ndriving\
    \ vehicles, unpredictable and long delays can become a\nthreat to people’s lives.\
    \ In this regard, the question arises\nabout the choice of data transmission protocols\
    \ for reliable\nand fast data transmission.\n1.1. Motivation. Various network\
    \ technologies are used\neverywhere in everyday life. Systems are getting smarter\
    \ and\nthere is always a problem of limited resources. Millions of\nsensors continuously\
    \ create and transmit data to manage\nHindawi\nJournal of Computer Networks and\
    \ Communications\nVolume 2022, Article ID 7368691, 18 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7368691\n\
    real-world infrastructures that use complex Internet of\nthings (IoT) networks.\
    \ For various spheres of human ac-\ntivity, various technologies and protocols\
    \ are being devel-\noped for the organization of the network and the eﬃcient\n\
    operation of the infrastructure. Te predominant areas of\ndevelopment of such\
    \ network technologies are smart en-\nvironment, autonomous transport, and medicine.\n\
    1.1.1. Smart Environment. A smart environment includes\nthe automation of various\
    \ processes of our everyday life. It\nincludes such technologies as smart home,\
    \ smart city, smart\nmanufacturing, etc. In a smart environment, the question\
    \ of\nlimited resources also arises, since smart devices and various\nsensors\
    \ are also used to create this environment. Te re-\nsources of IoT devices are\
    \ very limited, and there is no\npossibility to perform complex computing tasks\
    \ locally. At\nthe same time, the bandwidth of data transmission channels\nis\
    \ also limited and it is impossible to use the entire resource\nfor the functioning\
    \ of systems. To solve these problems,\nvarious approaches to building infrastructure\
    \ related to edge\ncomputing are being created [1]. At the same time, the basic\n\
    data transfer technologies are the IoT protocols, and they\nplay a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in the operation of a particular smart\nenvironment system.\n1.1.2. Autonomous\
    \ Transport. Autonomous transport in-\ncludes a set of units like sensors, GPU,\
    \ CPU actuators, etc.\nTe operation of an onboard control system is based on the\n\
    transmission of information between subsystems. Terefore,\nit is crucial to realize\
    \ a reliable exchange of data. Te main\nparameters are a guarantee of data delivery,\
    \ data integrity,\nmaximum possible latency of data transmitting, and cal-\nculation\
    \ cost. Furthermore, it is vital to balance require-\nments considering diﬀerent\
    \ kinds of data: vast streams of\ninformation from sensors, short commands from\
    \ CPUs, etc.\nTerefore, the data transfer protocol has to provide the best\npossible\
    \ parameters for distributed and complicated au-\ntonomous control systems.\n\
    1.1.3. Medicine. Modern healthcare involves many personal\nwearable sensors that\
    \ constantly monitor a person’s con-\ndition. Tere are diﬀerent views on what\
    \ the architecture of\nnext-generation medical platforms should be. Researchers\n\
    agree that the integration of personal sensors into a uniﬁed\nhealth information\
    \ system is inevitable. Tis implies eﬀective\nways to communicate in a heterogeneous\
    \ environment. Te\ncommunication methods discussed in this article will be\nuseful\
    \ to those who design medical systems.\n2. Literature Overview\nTis section will\
    \ present the work done in the ﬁeld of this\nstudy as well as a description of\
    \ each of the protocols under\nconsideration. After considering the theoretical\
    \ part of the\nprotocols, the main questions that this study is trying to\nanswer\
    \ are put forward.\n2.1. Related Works. A large number of studies and works have\n\
    been conducted on the problem of choosing a protocol for real-\ntime systems.\
    \ Various IoT protocols are analyzed for perfor-\nmance, security, and reliability.\
    \ Since AMQP and MQTT pro-\ntocols are popular in the IoT, it is important to\
    \ understand the\nsecurity vulnerabilities associated with the each protocol.\
    \ In\n[2–5], an analysis of vulnerabilities and cyber threats for these\nprotocols\
    \ was made. Also, in [6], an analysis of AMQP protocol\nfor industrial IoT was\
    \ done. For MQTT in [7], a comparison\nwith CoAP on Ponte Eclipse Project implementation\
    \ was\nprovided. Also, an analysis of MQTT performance was done in\n[8]. Tere\
    \ is a formal approach to model, analyze, and verify the\nusage of MQTT in the\
    \ case of communicating vehicles in [9].\nTe dependence of delay and QoS level\
    \ in MQTT was analyzed\nin [10]. An analysis and a comparison of AMQP, MQTT, CoAP,\n\
    and HTTP protocols without any implementation were done in\n[11]. Since AMQP uses\
    \ queues, a detailed analysis of message\nqueue methods and a comparison of RabbitMQ,\
    \ ActiveMQ, and\nKafka implementations were made in [12]. Also, RabbitMQ,\nwhich\
    \ is an implementation of AMQP, was analyzed as message-\noriented middleware\
    \ (MOM) and compared to NATS and\nKafka in [13]. An analysis of OPC UA, DDS, and\
    \ MQTT\nprotocols for Industry 4.0 was done in [14]. More details about\nDDS and\
    \ data-centric communication were given in [15]. Te\nDDS standard was designed\
    \ for real-time systems on mission-\ncritical infrastructures. So, security is\
    \ necessary to avoid disaster\nand loss of life. Security issues for DDS were\
    \ analyzed in [16, 17].\nTouching on our previous research, we have analyzed the\n\
    existing data transmission standards in the IoT [18] and the\nperformance of DDS\
    \ services [19].\n2.2. Protocol Overview. In this section, we will brieﬂy con-\n\
    sider the main concepts of the protocols and highlight the\nbasic features that\
    \ are stated in the speciﬁcations. Each\nprotocol was created to solve a certain\
    \ range of tasks, so it is\nworth getting acquainted with each of them to understand\n\
    the relevance of using the protocol in the modern IoT.\nIn IoT, the most relevant\
    \ protocols are MQTT, AMQP,\nJMS, XMPP, CoAP, and RTPS (DDSI-RTPS). XMPP does\n\
    not support any delivery guarantees, but only allows to\nrequest information from\
    \ the client about the delivery of\ndata [20], so this protocol is not considered\
    \ in this article,\nbecause the real-time system requires these delivery guar-\n\
    antees to work with up-to-date data. Also, the CoAP pro-\ntocol is not discussed\
    \ in this article; although the addition of\nthe publish-subscribe model to this\
    \ protocol is interesting\nfor real-time systems, the standard client-server model\
    \ is not\nsuitable for real-time data transmissionbecause this model\nrequires\
    \ sending requests to receive new data. Tese pro-\ntocols solve the problem of\
    \ data exchange in any format,\nqueue processing, and data distribution. Each\
    \ of the con-\nsidered protocols provides diﬀerent guarantees, so it is\nnecessary\
    \ to understand for which target systems a particular\nprotocol may be suitable\
    \ or for which data.\n2.2.1. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT).\nMQTT\
    \ (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a light-\nweight transport protocol\
    \ that releases a publish-subscribe\n2\nJournal of Computer Networks and Communications\n\
    model. Te protocol is an open OASIS standard and an ISO\nrecommended.\nMQTTwas\
    \ invented by Dr Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM,\nand Arlen Nipper of Arcom (now Eurotech),\
    \ in 1999. Tere\nwas a problem with communication between monitoring\ndevices\
    \ and remote servers in the oil and gas industry. In\nmany cases, it was diﬃcult\
    \ or impossible to use a landline,\nwired connection, or radio transmission connection.\
    \ During\nthat time, satellite communication was the only solution to\nthis problem.\
    \ But it was very expensive, and it was necessary\nto pay according to the volume\
    \ of data transmitted. So,\nthousands of sensors required a form of communication\
    \ that\ncould provide reliable data transmission with minimal\nbandwidth use.\n\
    Two developers speciﬁed the features of the tool to solve\nthis problem:\n(i)\
    \ Simple implementation\n(ii) Lightweight and bandwidth eﬃcient\n(iii) Quality\
    \ of service\n(iv) Data agnostic\n(v) Continuous session awareness\nIBM used protocol\
    \ after it was created for internal\npurposes for about 10 years. Ten IBM released\
    \ MQTT 3.1 as\na free version in 2010. From that time on, everyone was able\n\
    to use the protocol. In 2014, MQTT became an oﬃcially\napproved OASIS standard.\n\
    In 2019, OASIS ratiﬁed the new MQTT 5 speciﬁcation.\nTe new version speciﬁed features\
    \ that are required in the\nIoT industry, such as more reliability and error handling.\n\
    It works on top of any ordered, lossless, bidirectional\nnetwork protocol, for\
    \ example TCP or SSL. In MQTT, there\nare two entities: the server (broker) and\
    \ the clients. All\nmessages from senders who are called publishers are passed\n\
    by the broker to receivers who are called subscribers. All data\nare divided into\
    \ topics—the label attached to the message.\nTe server matches the topic with\
    \ subscription and forwards\nmessages if they match. Tis is how clients behave:\n\
    (i) Connect to the broker\n(ii) Subscribe to a topic and wait for incoming messages\n\
    or send messages to the topic(s)\n(iii) Close the connection\nMQTT provides topics\
    \ with wildcard, shared subscrip-\ntions and quality of service.\nTere is also\
    \ a variation of the protocol—MQTT-SN\n(MQTT for sensor networks). It is designed\
    \ especially for\nsensor networks. MQTT-SN can work on top of non-TCP/\nIP network\
    \ protocols such as UDP. Header size has also been\nreduced, and the UTF-8 topic\
    \ string has been replaced by an\ninteger topic id.\nQuality of services deﬁnes\
    \ the delivery guarantee. Tere\nare three levels:\n(i) QoS 0: At-most-once delivery.\
    \ Message is sent only\none time. Te receiver sends no response and the\nsender\
    \ performs no retry.\n(ii) QoS 1: At least once delivery. Message is sent until\
    \ it\narrives at the subscriber at least once. Te subscriber\nsends an acknowledgment\
    \ to the publisher after\ngetting the message. Te publisher performs a retry\n\
    until an acknowledgment is received. Te subscriber\nprocesses any copy of the\
    \ message as a new unique\nmessage.\n(iii) QoS 2: Exactly one delivery. Te subscriber\
    \ receives\nonly one copy of the message by a two-step ac-\nknowledgment process.\
    \ Like in QoS 1, the sub-\nscriber\nsends\nthe\nacknowledgment,\nbut\nthe\npublisher\
    \ sends a second acknowledgment back,\nand after getting it, the subscriber sends\
    \ back a ﬁnal\nacknowledgment that completes message trans-\nmission. During the\
    \ acknowledgment exchange, the\nreceiver drops any message that has the same packet\n\
    identiﬁer as the current message.\nAs described earlier, the topic is a label\
    \ attached to the\nmessage. Topic names can form a hierarchical topic tree by\n\
    separating each level with a forward slash. Subscribers use a\ntopic ﬁlter to\
    \ let the broker know which topics are of interest\nto them. Wildcards can be\
    \ used in the topic ﬁlter. Te\nnumber sign is a multilevel wildcard that matches\
    \ any\nnumber of topic levels, including zero topics. Te plus sign is\na single-level\
    \ wildcard that matches to only one topic level,\nincluding zero topics.\nMQTT\
    \ deﬁnes two types of subscriptions: shared and\nnon-shared. Te main diﬀerence\
    \ is the number of copies of\nthe message. With the non-shared subscription, all\
    \ receivers\nwho subscribe to the same topic get their own copy of the\nmessage.\
    \ With the shared subscription, only one copy of the\nmessage is sent to the one\
    \ shared group. Tat way, a load-\nbalanced network architecture can be created.\
    \ Shared sub-\nscriptions are also useful for parallel processing of publi-\n\
    cations by multiple clients.\n2.2.2. Real-Time Publish-Subscribe Protocol (RTPS).\
    \ Te\nRTPS data exchange protocol, also known as DDSI-RTPS, is\ndeveloped by the\
    \ Object Management Group (OMG), as\npart of the DDS standard, responsible for\
    \ data transfer and\nensuring compatibility between diﬀerent vendors as well as\n\
    ensuring platform independence of the DDS service. Te\nﬁrst version of the DDS\
    \ speciﬁcation was released in 2004\nand the RTPS protocol speciﬁcation version\
    \ in 2009.\nDDSI-RTPS protocol is developed for reliable and high-\nspeed transmission\
    \ via unreliable data transfer protocols, for\nexample via UDP.\nDDSI-RTPS is\
    \ based on the concept described in the\nDDS standard. Te model describes entities\
    \ such as:\n(i) Domain\n(ii) Topic\n(iii) Publisher who sends data to the topic\
    \ via the\nDataWriter\n(iv) Subscriber who gets data from the DataReader\nTe publisher\
    \ and subscriber are the end nodes who\nsends and receives data, respectively,\
    \ and the subject is an\nJournal of Computer Networks and Communications\n3\n\
    entity that describes the channel to which data are sent,\nwhich subscribers can\
    \ track. A domain is an entity that\ndivides topics, publishers, and subscribers\
    \ into diﬀerent\nname domains. Terefore, the topic, publisher, and sub-\nscriber\
    \ belong to a speciﬁc domain and cannot interact with\nnodes from another domain.\
    \ At the same time, subscribers\nand publishers do not know anything about each\
    \ other, but\nare connected only by the topic through which the data are\ntransmitted.\n\
    Te RTPS protocol is based on four main modules:\n(i) A structural module that\
    \ describes the structure of\nentities;\n(ii) A message module that describes\
    \ the structure of\ntransmitted messages;\n(iii) A behavior module that describes\
    \ the sequence of\nmessage transmission and the time constraints\nimposed on the\
    \ transmission of each message;\n(iv) A discovery module that describes how nodes\
    \ ﬁnd\neach other to interact with.\nTo ensure reliable data delivery, the protocol\
    \ describes an\nentity such as CacheChanges. Each node (DataReader or\nDataWriter)\
    \ has such an entity. When sending and receiving\ndata, each node makes a note\
    \ about this in the Cache Changes.\nTe\nprotocol\nhas\nthree\nmessage\ntypes:\n\
    DATA,\nHEARTBEAT, and ACKNACK. DATA is a message with\ndata, HEARTBEAT is a message\
    \ with changes in Cache-\nChanges of DataWriter, and ACKNACK is a message with\n\
    changes in CacheChanges of DataReader. With the help of\nHEARTBEAT and ACKNACK,\
    \ it is possible to determine\nwhat data were sent but not delivered, which will\
    \ allow\nresending these data. But since the DataWriter only knows\nabout data\
    \ loss when it receives changes from the Data-\nReader, which in turn are sent\
    \ only when the message is\nreceived, the packet loss will only be known when\
    \ the\nDataReader receives the next message, which generally vi-\nolates the sequence\
    \ of receiving messages. To ensure that the\nsequence is correct, the protocol\
    \ makes messages unavailable\nuntil all the necessary data are received.\nTe discovery\
    \ module contains two protocols that im-\nplement the search for nodes in the\
    \ network. Te ﬁrst\nprotocol is the Participant Discovery Protocol (PDP), which\n\
    describes the algorithm for searching for nodes in a network\nbelonging to a speciﬁc\
    \ domain, and the second protocol is\nthe Endpoint Discovery Protocol (EDP), which\
    \ describes the\nsearch for speciﬁc DataReader and DataWriter in a domain.\nTus,\
    \ we can distinguish the following qualities of this\nprotocol:\n(i) Providing\
    \ automatic search by nodes of each other;\n(ii) Providing data transmission with\
    \ various QoS that\nthe DDS standard describes;\n(iii) High data transfer rate\
    \ due to the UDP protocol,\ninstead of TCP.\n2.2.3. Java Message Service (JMS).\
    \ A new programming\nlanguage Java was introduced in 1995. As there was not a\n\
    mechanism that provided communication between a few\nprograms, JMS (Java Message\
    \ Service) was created in 1998 to\nsolve this problem. Te last version (2.0a)\
    \ of the JMS\nstandard was updated in 2015.\nJMS is similar to other middleware.\
    \ It has two types of\ncommunication: point to point and publish and subscribe.\n\
    In both communication styles, there is a JMS provider that is\nused to manage\
    \ connections, queues, and resources.\nOpening the ﬁrst connection creates a provider\
    \ outside Java\nvirtual machine.\nPoint-to-point messaging means that there are\
    \ two pro-\ncesses communicating with each other. Tis communication\ntype uses\
    \ message queues. Each process has a message queue as\na “mailbox.” Queues accept\
    \ all types of messages and are not\nindividual for every message sender, so there\
    \ is no need in\nhaving more than one queue on each side. Each queue can be\n\
    used by a few clients, but they will not receive all messages in\ncase after delivery\
    \ every message becomes consumed and\ncannot be retrieved by any client. In JMS,\
    \ there are two types of\nqueues: temporary and static. Temporary queues can be\
    \ used\nonly in one connection, because they exist only during the\nlifetime of\
    \ the connection. Static queues are most commonly\nused. Tey can be used in a\
    \ few connections and also they may\nstill exist after the client program’s end,\
    \ so while restarting, the\nclient can retrieve messages from this queue.\nPublish\
    \ and subscribe messaging is a common publish-\nsubscribe model, where few processes\
    \ communicate through\na topic. Reliability depends on the subscriber’s durability\
    \ and\npublishing persistence. Nonpersistent publishing results in\nat-most-once\
    \ reliability, while persistent publishing results\nin once-and-only-once reliability.\
    \ Nondurable subscribers\ncan miss messages if they are inactive, while durable\
    \ sub-\nscribers cannot miss messages. Persistent publishing is\nmostly implemented\
    \ by static queues. Tere is no descrip-\ntion of how redelivery must be implemented.\n\
    As additional functionalities, there is a message selector.\nIt allows users to\
    \ ﬁlter messages by processing their header\nﬁelds. It uses SQL syntax to do that.\
    \ Also, some providers\nallow the use of topic hierarchy, which helps to send\
    \ a\nmessage to a few topics immediately.\n2.2.4.\nAdvanced\nMessage\nQueuing\n\
    Protocol\n(AMQP).\nAMQP was developed by John O’Hara in 2003. One of the\nﬁrst\
    \ implementations of this protocol was Apache Qpid. Red\nHat started developing\
    \ it in 2005. In 2007, Rabbit Tech-\nnologies released their implementation of\
    \ AMQP called\nRabbitMQ.\nAMQP deﬁnes three types of nodes: producers, con-\n\
    sumers, and queues. Producers and consumers are parts of\nthe application that\
    \ generate and proceed messages. Each\nnode is attached to a container which can\
    \ be a client or\nbroker. Te diﬀerence between clients and brokers is only in\n\
    expected capabilities.\nIn AMQP to start communication ﬁrstly required to\ncreate\
    \ a connection between containers. Ten the session can\nbe started. Every connection\
    \ may contain multiple sessions.\nTereafter, a link can be established between\
    \ two nodes. All\nlinks are unidirectional. On each side of the link, there is\
    \ a\nterminus that controls message ﬂow through the link.\n4\nJournal of Computer\
    \ Networks and Communications\nMessages can be transmitted only through a link.\
    \ In\nrelation to nodes, messages can be divided into a few types,\nnamely originate\
    \ from, terminate at, or relay by nodes.\nQueues are used to store messages and\
    \ make them available\nto few consumers. So, the main purpose of brokers is to\n\
    manage queues to receive messages from producers, store\nthem, and transmit messages\
    \ to consumers.\nEvery message delivery has a settlement state, which\ncontrols\
    \ if a message has been delivered, and delivery state.\nTo set settlement, nodes\
    \ send frames. When the receiver\nsends a settlement frame of delivery, the sender\
    \ removes\ndelivery from its unsettled map. It can be used to implement\ndiﬀerent\
    \ reliability policies. If the sender sets the settlement\nof delivery after message\
    \ sending, then the message will be\ndelivered “at most once.” If the receiver\
    \ sends a settlement of\ndelivery and the sender waits for settlement, then it\
    \ im-\nplements the “at least once” guarantee. To perform “exactly\nonce,” the\
    \ delivery sender has to set settlement only after the\nreceiver sets the terminal\
    \ delivery state, and the receiver has\nto set settlements after the sender. But\
    \ in this case, a few\nframes should be sent: at least one for termination and\
    \ one\nfor settlement. Tere is no other way to implement reliable\ntransfer without\
    \ duplications in AMQP.\nAdditionally, AMQP provides security protocol support,\n\
    such as TLS and SASL. Also, it has a transactional messaging\nmodel. Transactional\
    \ works consist of three operations:\nposting, acquiring, and retiring. Target\
    \ performs posting and\nmakes a message unavailable at the destination until it\
    \ will be\nfully discharged. Source performs retirement to associate an\noutcome\
    \ of delivery with the transactionSource acquires\ntransaction message to perform\
    \ operation.\n2.3. Conclusion of the Overview. A lot of work has been done\nin\
    \ the ﬁeld of IoT protocol research. Diﬀerent studies in-\nvestigate diﬀerent\
    \ characteristics of data transmission and\nuse diﬀerent methodologies. Each protocol\
    \ has many\nimplementations that can be better or worse relative to each\nother,\
    \ and the research done can also use various protocol\nimplementations for analysis.\
    \ In addition, it is necessary to\nconsider all protocols under the same conditions\
    \ in order to\nachieve objective comparison results. Depending on the\nmethodology,\
    \ selected software implementations, and the\nrange of protocols under consideration,\
    \ the results of the\nstudy may vary.\nAll these factors complicate the choice\
    \ of a solution and\nprotocol for a speciﬁc task. Tis article examines the best\n\
    software implementations based on the work done and\ncreates the same conditions\
    \ for evaluating middleware.\n3. Materials and Methods\nTo analyze and compare\
    \ the protocols selected for consid-\neration, it is necessary to formulate criteria\
    \ that will show\ntheir characteristics, select software implementations that\n\
    use the protocols in data transmission, and develop a testing\nmethodology that\
    \ would allow studying these technologies\nfrom diﬀerent angles.\nIn this section,\
    \ we will consider the methods developed\nin our work for studying software solutions\
    \ for data\ntransmission that emit various conditions. Such conditions\ncan occur\
    \ in diﬀerent systems, so it is necessary to evaluate\nnot only the maximum capabilities\
    \ of these software tools,\nbut also their behavior in critical situations that\
    \ can be\ncreated by developers during the development of the system.\nWe will\
    \ also deﬁne the criteria for selecting speciﬁc data\ntransfer libraries for each\
    \ protocol.\n3.1. Description of Comparison Methods and Testing Methods.\nEvery\
    \ protocol has its own reason for creation, which lies in\nits feature. It has\
    \ both pros and cons. It is diﬃcult to predict\nthe performance of protocol based\
    \ on analysis only. Te\nperformance also depends not least on the implementation\n\
    of the protocol. In addition, machines have diﬀerent power,\nwhich also aﬀects\
    \ performance. It is necessary to know data\ntransmission characteristics for\
    \ objective evaluation and\ncomparison. Comparison of diﬀerent protocols can be\n\
    diﬃcult because they work diﬀerently and are designed for\ndiﬀerent purposes.\
    \ Terefore, it is good to have a universal\nvalue characteristic that shows the\
    \ practical side of protocols.\nTis makes it possible to compare and select implementa-\n\
    tions without knowing their internal structure.\nTest scenarios have been developed\
    \ to evaluate diﬀerent\nimplementations. Tese tests simulate situations with dif-\n\
    ferent environments: message interval, number of subscribers\nor exchanging pairs,\
    \ frequency, and message size. Te limits\nin the tests can be viewed as hard real-time\
    \ situations. All this\ngives an insight into the limitations and problems of\
    \ the\nprotocol and/or the implementation. Tis helps to decide if\nthe protocol\
    \ is a good solution for a certain problem.\nFor each selected implementation,\
    \ corresponding pro-\ngrams were written that have identical logic. Te diﬀerence\n\
    between the programs is only in the functions of sending and\nreceiving data,\
    \ which use the API of the selected middleware\ndirectly. Te general logic of\
    \ the tests has the following three\ntypes of interaction:\n(i) One-way data transfer,\
    \ when the program performs\nthe role of either only the sender or only the receiver\n\
    with a speciﬁed frequency and with a speciﬁed\npayload size;\n(ii) Two-way data\
    \ transfer, where one node sends\nmessages only when it receives a response from\
    \ the\nother, thus measuring RTT and jitter;\n(iii) Two-way data transfer, when\
    \ one node does not\nwait for a response, but sends messages at a certain\ninterval,\
    \ while it is possible to artiﬁcially limit the\nqueue by indexing received and\
    \ sent messages.\nTo obtain objective results of data processing by the\nselected\
    \ technologies, programs are assigned to a separate\ncore with exclusive use of\
    \ its resources, which guarantees\nthat the programs work in the same conditions.\n\
    Te characteristics of the system that was tested are\nshown in Table 1. All tests\
    \ were performed locally on a single\ncomputer. Te test scenarios used in the\
    \ study will be de-\nscribed below.\nJournal of Computer Networks and Communications\n\
    5\n3.1.1. Evaluating Queue Processing Performance. Te test is\naimed at investigating\
    \ message queue processing. In the test,\nthe ﬁrst node sends messages to the\
    \ other node without any\ninterval. Tus, the queue accumulates.\nTe test is performed\
    \ with message sizes of 50 and 60,000\nbytes. Te process priority is set to the\
    \ highest in Linux–99.\nBoth the nodes are bound to the CPU cores. So, each process\n\
    is separate and works without interruptions during queue\nprocessing, such conditions\
    \ help to get the most accurate\ndata about the studied characteristic.\n3.1.2.\
    \ Evaluating the Impact of the Number of Nodes on\nPerformance. Te test is aimed\
    \ at investigating the depen-\ndence of the total latency on the number of subscribers.\
    \ In\nthe test, one node (publisher) sends messages to other\nnodes—subscribers.\
    \ Te message size with sending fre-\nquency takes up 1.25 MB per second of bandwidth.\n\
    Te test is performed with the number of subscribers\nvarying from 1 to 20. As\
    \ in test 1, all processes have the\nhighest priority in Linux–99. No node is\
    \ bound to the CPU\ncore. A separate test is run for each number of subscribers.\n\
    3.1.3. Evaluating the Impact of Message Size on Latency.\nTe test is aimed at\
    \ investigating the total latency in de-\npendence on message size. In the test,\
    \ the ﬁrst node sends\nmessages to the other node at a given interval. Te message\n\
    size increases during the test.\nTe test is performed on diﬀerent frequencies\
    \ which in\ncombination with the message sizes take from 2.5 kB to 2 GB\nper second\
    \ of bandwidth. As in previous tests, all processes\nhave the highest priority\
    \ in Linux–99. Te nodes are not\nbound to CPU cores.\n3.1.4. Estimation of the\
    \ Jitter Value and Minimum Delays.\nTe test is aimed at investigating the total\
    \ latency, jitter, and\nRTT (round trip time) of each message of the minimum size.\n\
    Te test also shows the number of copies between the user\nspace and the kernel\
    \ space. In this scenario, the ping-pong\nmodel is used: one node sends a message\
    \ to the other, and\nthen both exchange messages only after receiving a message\n\
    from the other node. Te test stops when the set number of\ntransmitted messages\
    \ is reached. Te size of each message is\n10 bytes. Nodes are not bound to CPU\
    \ cores and process\npriorities are not set.\n3.1.5. Evaluation of the Eﬀect of\
    \ the Number of Interacting\nProcesses in Diﬀerent Conditions on Delays. Te test\
    \ is aimed\nat investigating the dependence of the total latency on the\nmessage\
    \ size at diﬀerent message sending frequencies and on\nthe number of process pairs.\
    \ In this scenario, the ping-pong\nmodel is used, but the node that sends the\
    \ ﬁrst message, also\ncalled the ﬁrst node, does not wait to receive a message\
    \ from\nthe other node, as in the previous scenario, and sends new\nmessages on\
    \ a given frequency. Te other node works as in\nthe previous test. Te test stops\
    \ when the set number of\ntransmitted messages is reached.\nTe test consists of\
    \ two types of subtests: (1) one pair\nexchanges messages on a given frequency;\
    \ (2) at a ﬁxed\nfrequency, several pairs exchange messages. Te message\nsize\
    \ increases during the test in both subtests. In the ﬁrst\nsubtest, messages take\
    \ up a bandwidth in the range of\n5 kB–4 GB per second for both the nodes. In\
    \ the second\nsubtest, messages take up a bandwidth in the range of\n100 kB–1.5\
    \ GB per second for each pair. Te number of pairs\nin the second subtest is 1,\
    \ 2, and 3. Nodes are not bound to\nCPU cores and process priorities are not set.\n\
    3.1.6. Investigation of Delays in Artiﬁcially Fixing the Message\nQueue. Te test\
    \ is aimed at investigating the total latency of\nprocessing a limited queue.\
    \ Tis scenario uses the limited\nqueue ping-pong model from test 5. If the ﬁrst\
    \ node has a\ndiﬀerence between the number of the sent message and the\nlast received\
    \ one greater than the watermark value of 50, no\nmessage will be sent. It means\
    \ that messages in the queue are\nnot more than the value of the watermark. Due\
    \ to the limited\nqueue, the latency will be constant or does not exceed some\n\
    constant value. Te size of each message is 10 bytes. Nodes\nare not bound to CPU\
    \ cores and process priorities are not\nset.\n3.2. Description of the Framework\
    \ Selection. Te main\ncriteria for framework selection are open source and C/C++/\n\
    Java programming language for clients.\nTe JMS is very abstract, so this research\
    \ could have been\nany Java client with or without any server. But in this article,\n\
    there is an idea of comparing with Java realization, so the\nJMQ has been selected.\
    \ Te server is called GlassFish, and it\nwas developed by Sun Microsystems and\
    \ later passed under\nthe wing of the Eclipse Foundation. Te auto-acknowledge\n\
    of message property is used for testing. Te nonpersistent\nproperty is also set.\
    \ If the persistent property is set, the\nmessage is copied to the hardware to\
    \ avoid losing it.\nTere are many implementations of the DDS standard:\nOpenDDS,\
    \ OpenSplice, FastRTPS, and Cyclone DDS. Tere\nare evaluations of FastRTPS on\
    \ the eProsima website [21]. We\nalso have another close research comparing all\
    \ these four\nDDS frameworks. In it, FastRTPS was the winner. For ex-\nample,\
    \ in Figure 1, there is a delay graph for messages with\nincreasing size (we use\
    \ “Evaluating the impact of message size\non latency” test scenario). Te results\
    \ of OpenSplice (the\npublic version of this solution) were not added to the image,\n\
    as this solution showed a terrible result with delays in seconds\nafter 200 messages,\
    \ where the size was 512 kB. As pictured,\nFastRTPS shows the best result. Terefore,\
    \ FastRTPS has been\nselected for this research. For guarantee delivery, the fol-\n\
    lowing message properties are set: to achieve a delivery\nguarantee, parameters\
    \ are set for storing all messages that\nhave not yet been received by subscribers\
    \ and a QoS-reliable\npolicy is selected, which guarantees data delivery.\nTable\
    \ 1: System conﬁguration.\nOS\nLinux-5.4.54-rt with Ubuntu 18.04 bionic\nCPU\n\
    Intel Core i5, 3.0 GHz\nRAM\n8 GB\n6\nJournal of Computer Networks and Communications\n\
    Tere are not many implementations of AMQP. Tree\npopular servers are RabbitMQ,\
    \ ActiveMQ, and Apache\nQpid. A comparison of the frst two was made in [22], where\n\
    RabbitMQ showed better results. In [23], a comparison was\nmade between RabbitMQ\
    \ and Kafka, where the former\nshowed good results. Te Apache Qpid has been tested\
    \ in the\nfrst three tests. In Figure 2, there are results of RabbitMQ\nand Qpid\
    \ for the test “Evaluating the impact of message size\non latency.” As pictured,\
    \ Qpid is worse. In other tests, the\nQpid result is close to or worse than RabbitMQ.\
    \ Terefore,\nRabbitMQ has been selected for this research.\nTere are many MQTT\
    \ servers since the IoT becomes\nmore and more a part of our life. Evaluation,\
    \ analysis, and\ncomparison of MQTT brokers have been done in [24, 25]. In\nthese\
    \ researches, the best result was shown by the Mosquitto\nbroker. Terefore, this\
    \ broker is used in this research.\nPahoMQTT has been selected for the client\
    \ side. It is de-\nveloped by Eclipse Foundation. For the tests, the QoS level\
    \ is\nset to 1–at least once delivery.\n4. Results and Discussion\nTe analysis\
    \ of protocols should be divided into two sec-\ntions—theoretical and performance\
    \ evaluation—since the\nanalysis of specifcations will not give information about\
    \ the\nperformance of data transmission, but only helps to un-\nderstand the principles\
    \ of operation and guarantees pro-\nvided by the protocol. At the same time, protocol\n\
    implementations from diferent vendors may show diferent\ncharacteristics, so a\
    \ practical assessment of the performance\nof a particular solution does not give\
    \ an accurate assessment\nof the protocol.\nLater in the article, we will try\
    \ to analyze what these\nprotocols provide and consider the characteristics obtained\n\
    as a result of testing.\n4.1. Analysis of the Operation of the Protocols (Specifcation-\n\
    Based Analysis). To analyze the protocols, we studied the\nspecifcations of these\
    \ protocols, which are in the public\ndomain. In this part of the study, the advantages\
    \ and dis-\nadvantages of the algorithm of the protocols and the\ntechnologies\
    \ used were identifed.\n4.1.1. MQTT. MQTTpackets are lightweight. Each packet\
    \ is\ndivided into three sections: a fxed header, a variable header,\nand a payload.\
    \ Te fxed header consists of the packet type,\nfags, and remaining length. Summary\
    \ of the frst two gives 1\nbyte. Te variable header consists of a 2-byte packet\
    \ iden-\ntifer and properties which have a variable length. Some\npackets have\
    \ specifc required properties. Te payload is a\nuser’s message sent. Packets do\
    \ not take up much space.\nAlso, many properties are used in the packet for opening\n\
    connection. Only one required property in publish packet\ncan take up a lot of\
    \ space—the topic name. Te topic is a\nUTF-8 string. If needed, the topic can\
    \ be replaced by, for\nexample, the topic ID, like in MQTT-SN. But that would\n\
    cause problems with wildcards in topics. Terefore, if they\nare not used, it is\
    \ possible to reduce packet size by replacing\nthe topic with something else.\n\
    As said before there is no queue in MQTT. So, it becomes\na problem that the application\
    \ may not be able to process a\nmessage. Tis is not unusual on the network with\
    \ several\nthousand clients and thousand messages per second. QoS\nwas created\
    \ for solving this problem. But it also has other\nproblems. With QoS 1, the subscriber\
    \ spends time pro-\ncessing every message as a new one. With QoS 2, there are\n\
    three acknowledgment messages where each size is about 6\nbytes. So, every second,\
    \ each of a thousand subscribers sends\na thousand acknowledgments. It reduces\
    \ the bandwidth by\nat least 6 MB. MQTTis good for real time when it is required\n\
    to get actual data, but for data transfer with a delivery\ntime (msec)\nDelay\

    \ MQTT may be worse than other solutions based\non message queues.\nIn addition,\
    \ MQTTis centralized. So, it has a single point\nof failure which is the broker.\
    \ Tis can be a problem in some\ncases.\nTe quality of service that deﬁnes guarantee\
    \ delivery is\ndescribed in the MQTT. Is a lossless network protocol like\nTCP\
    \ required? TCP takes a lot of bandwidth. If the message\nis dropped by the server,\
    \ for example, due to performance\nlimitation, the message will be sent again,\
    \ which will take up\nmuch bandwidth again. It may be better to use UDP or other\n\
    UDP-based protocols, because they do not take much\nbandwidth. QoS levels 1 and\
    \ 2 guarantee delivery, so the\nexcess requirement of lossless to the network\
    \ protocol is not\nnecessary.\nAdvantages:\n(i) Lightweight packets;\n(ii) QoS\
    \ levels;\n(iii) Ability to ﬁlter messages.\nDisadvantages:\n(i) MQTT uses TCP/IP;\n\
    (ii) Centralized model;\n(iii) No queues.\n4.1.2. RTPS. Te RTPS protocol has many\
    \ advantages over\nother protocols. As described in the review, the protocol is\n\
    positioned as a reliable data transfer protocol, using unre-\nliable transport\
    \ layer protocols-UDP/UDPM. Using these\nprotocols, the highest channel throughput\
    \ and data transfer\nrate are provided.\nWith the help of the Simple Participant\
    \ Discovery\nProtocol, the DDS standard provides the ability to dy-\nnamically\
    \ connect to the network without having to know\nthe addresses of senders/recipients.\
    \ Tis provides a plug and\nplay connection, in which the nodes ﬁnd each other\
    \ by\nthemselves. But the protocol does not guarantee compati-\nbility between\
    \ diﬀerent implementations from diﬀerent\nvendors.\nTe protocol supports QoS levels\
    \ for the best eﬀort or\nreliable connection. A reliable connection is achieved\
    \ by\nresending data if the packet has not been delivered, but\ninformation about\
    \ the delivery of the packet will not be\nreceived using special messages, as\
    \ in TCP, but only when\nthe next packet with data is received. Tis algorithm\
    \ blocks\nthe receipt of the packet until all the lost packets are de-\nlivered.\
    \ Tis can increase delivery delays quite signiﬁcantly\nin some situations.\nAdditional\
    \ data that help in ensuring the reliability of the\nconnection (guarantees of\
    \ data delivery) can also set limits\non the data storage time of this message,\
    \ limits on the time of\nmessage delivery, and other parameters that may be nec-\n\
    essary for real-time data transmission.\nTe protocol implies a modular system\
    \ that guarantees\nthe absence of a single point of failure, allows for expansion\n\
    without loss of compatibility, and uses separately from the\nDDS standard.\nAs\
    \ a result, the following advantages of the protocol can\nbe distinguished:\n\
    (i) Availability of QoS and ﬂexible conﬁguration of\ndelivery and data storage\
    \ parameters for each\nmessage;\n(ii) Plug and play connection;\n(iii) Using UDP\
    \ for fast data transfer;\n(iv) No single point of failure.\nTe disadvantages\
    \ are as follows:\n(i) Increased latency in the case of packet loss;\n(ii) Possible\
    \ incompatibility between vendors.\n4.1.3. JMS. JMS is a good solution for systems\
    \ where reli-\nability can be implemented as static queues. But the usage in\n\
    real-time systems can be failing in case of using static queues\nin persistent\
    \ storage.\nAdvantages:\n(i) It is easy to use. It does not use additional\nstructures,\
    \ such as for identifying messages that\nwere received. Tere are no special messages\
    \ de-\nﬁned for some purposes, such as preventing\nmessage duplications;\n(ii)\
    \ It does not require a broker to manage message\nﬂow. It uses queues without\
    \ a special manager that\nexists in another process, which makes it fault-\ntolerant;\n\
    (iii) May store messages after client failure. In the case\nof using a static\
    \ queue, messages can be stored as\nlong as it is required. So, after all, every\
    \ node can\nreceive all messages sent to them.\nDisadvantages:\n(i) Standard is\
    \ too uncertain in many details. It can be\ninterpreted in diﬀerent ways. So,\
    \ implementations\nmay have very diﬀerent characteristics;\n(ii) It does not pretend\
    \ to deliver messages quickly.\nOther standards may say that they were developed\n\
    for quick messaging. But JMS was created to allow\ncommunication in Java, and\
    \ it does not say about\ndelivery speed.\n4.1.4. AMQP. AMQP cares about message\
    \ transportation\non every transition. Tis can be used in distributed systems\n\
    where nodes are grouped in diﬃcult architecture. Also,\nsystems using transactions\
    \ can be interested in this protocol.\nAdvantages:\n(i) Strong control of message\
    \ ﬂow on every system\nnode. It uses maps of settled messages and addi-\ntional\
    \ frames that allow to ensure that every\nmessage has been delivered to each transition\
    \ node;\n(ii) It has a transactional model. It allows the control of\nfull completion\
    \ of operations. In case of failure or\ncanceling\noperation,\noperations\nwill\n\
    not\nbe\n8\nJournal of Computer Networks and Communications\ncompleted. It is\
    \ possible because messages can be\nprocessed only after the completion of a transaction.\n\
    Disadvantages:\n(i) It does not have a Pub-Sub model that results in\nusing the\
    \ same way to send messages from pub-\nlishers to subscribers and to send messages\
    \ from\npoint to point;\n(ii) It has increased frame fow. It uses frames to settle\n\
    messages, terminate deliveries, etc. So, it can cause\na decrease in the latency\
    \ of common messages\nbecause of frame transmission and processing.\n4.2. Evaluating\
    \ the Performance of Protocol Implementations\n4.2.1. Evaluating Queue Processing\
    \ Performance. Tere are\ntwo ascending lines, namely RabbitMQ and PahoMQTT\nwith\
    \ Mosquitto broker (see Figure 3). As shown in the graph,\nthe delay for these\
    \ frameworks grows during the whole test.\nTe growth starts at the begging of\
    \ the test. Te peak of delay\nat the end of the test is several seconds. Tis is\
    \ not a good\nresult. Messages are sent more quickly than they can be\ndelivered.\
    \ Te queue is constantly accumulating and the\ntime to receive each packet is\
    \ delayed. Tere is a horizontal\nline. It is FastRTPS. Tis framework demonstrates\
    \ a very\nstable data transmission for this message size. It is the best\nresult.\
    \ Te last one left is GlassFish. Its graph is very similar\nto FastRTPS, but has\
    \ delayed growth in the middle of the\ntest. But the delay decreases in the second\
    \ half of the test. It\ndecreases because messages stop being sent and the queue\n\
    stops being replenished, messages start being processed until\nthey run out. GlassFish\
    \ also has a higher delay than\nFastRTPS but less than 1 second. So, this is a\
    \ good result.\nIn Figure 4, there is a graph of delays for a message size of\n\
    60000 bytes. Tere are three rising lines. Two of them are\nRabbitMQ and PahoMQTT\
    \ with Mosquitto broker. Tey do\nnot change their behavior unlike FastRTPS. Tis\
    \ is a third\nascending line. Te situation is more deplorable than with\nthe other\
    \ two. FastRTPS has the highest delay, which grows\nthrough the tests. Tis may\
    \ be because FastRTPS (Fast-DDS)\nuses UDP for data transmission, which imposes\
    \ a limit on\nthe packet size and the message must be transmitted in\nseveral\
    \ parts if it is larger than 65 kB, which greatly increases\nthe data transfer\
    \ delay of 1 message. GlassFish does not\nchange its behavior. Its delay grows\
    \ until the middle of the\ntest and then decreases. Te delay is also under 1 second,\n\
    which is the best result. Tus, according to the results of the\ntwo subtests,\
    \ GlassFish shows the best stable and fastest\nqueue processing performance.\n\
    4.2.2. Evaluating the Impact of the Number of Nodes on\nPerformance. In Figures\
    \ 5–8, minimum and maximum\ndelay and its mean and interquartile range for a diferent\n\
    number of subscribers can be seen. Also, mean and maxi-\nmum delays are presented\
    \ for each ffth number of sub-\nscribers in Table 2.\nGlassFish has no delay dependence\
    \ on the number of\nsubscribers. Te maximum delay varies and is more than 100\n\
    milliseconds but without dependence. Te mean and the\nmid-spread are less than\
    \ 25 milliseconds. But the IQR\n(interquartile range) is large, and its size is\
    \ about a few\nmilliseconds.\nFastRTPS also has no delay dependence on the number\n\
    of subscribers. Te minimum and maximum are the same\nduring the test. Te delay\
    \ ranges from 1 second or less to\n10–12 milliseconds. Te mean and mid-spread\
    \ have no\ndependence and are in range the from 1 to 4 milliseconds.\nTe IQR is\
    \ less than 1 millisecond.\nPahoMQTT has abnormal jumps of up to 60 and 100\n\
    milliseconds on 15 and 18 subscribers. Te mean and mid-\nspread are less than\
    \ 5 milliseconds. Tere is no delay de-\npendence on the number of subscribers.\

    \ jumps up to 20 milliseconds on several\nnumbers of subscribers. Tere is also\
    \ no delay dependence.\nAccording to the results, no framework has a depen-\n\
    dency on the number of subscribers. Tis means that the\nsoftware processing of\
    \ the queues of these implementations\ntakes quite a short time and does not afect\
    \ the data transfer\ndelay under these conditions. It is a good result because\
    \ data\ntransfer time does not change with the number of sub-\nscribers. In addition,\
    \ GlassFish shows the worst results, with\na mean value of about 10 milliseconds,\
    \ while the maximum\ndelays reach a few hundred milliseconds. Te other three\n\
    have similar means and mid-spreads, but FastRTPS results\nare better. However,\
    \ the maximum delay of FastRTPS is\nworse than RabbitMQ and PahoMQTT, but the\
    \ last two\nhave abnormal unknown delay jumps.\n4.2.3. Evaluating the Impact of\
    \ Message Size on Latency.\nIn this test, message size changes every 100 messages.\
    \ Fig-\nure 9 shows delays for all frameworks at a frequency of 100\nmessages\
    \ per second. Te means and maximums of delays\nfor several message sizes for the\
    \ frameworks are presented in\nTable 3.\nTere is no diference between messages\
    \ on the GlassFish\ngraph. It is as if messages are sent with a static size instead\
    \ of\nincreasing ones. Te delay and its maximum increase and\ndecrease during\
    \ the test. Te maximum delay reaches 100\nmilliseconds. Te mean grows while the\
    \ message size is less\nthan 1 MB. After means are similar, they are about 18\n\
    milliseconds. Tus, GlassFish delay is not dependent on\nmessage size so much.\n\
    FastRTPS graph shows that the frequency of delay jumps\nincreases with message\
    \ size. Tese jumps are repeated when\nthe test is repeated, which indicates that\
    \ they are caused by\nthe testing logic. But for other implementations, there\
    \ are no\nsuch jumps, which can be regarded as unstable operation of\nFastRTPS\
    \ in these conditions. Also, the mean and maximum\ndelay increase with message\
    \ size. Te mean reaches 14.5\ntime (msec)\nDelay time with multiple subscribers\n\

    milliseconds and the maximum reaches 65.5 milliseconds at\nthe maximal message\
    \ size. At a message size of 1.5 MB, there\nis an abnormal spike. Te maximum delay\
    \ is 160 millisec-\nonds. Tus, FastRTPS delay depends on message size. It\nincreases\
    \ with size, but it is a linear dependence.\nTe PahoMQTT and RabbitMQ graphs look\
    \ like stairs.\nEach step represents the moment of increase in message size.\n\
    So, the delay of these two frameworks depends on the\nmessage size. Te steps are\
    \ clear while the size is under 1 MB.\nTereafter, the delay becomes more chaotic.\
    \ Tere is an\ninteresting feature: PahoMQTT shows a better result until\nthe message\
    \ size reaches 1 MB. If the message size is greater\nthan 1 MB, the mean of RabbitMQ\
    \ delay is less than the\nPahoMQTT delay. It can be seen in Figure 9 that the\n\
    RabbitMQ graph is under the PahoMQTT graph. But the\nmaximum values of these frameworks\
    \ are quite close. Te\ndiference is a few milliseconds.\nAccording to the results,\
    \ all frameworks have a signifcant\ndelay dependence on message size, except GlassFish.\
    \ But the\nlast one has a very high delay. Te means are the same as\nmaximums,\
    \ for example RabbitMQ. As described earlier, if\nthe message size is less than\
    \ 1 MB, PahoMQTT is better than\nRabbitMQ, otherwise vice versa. FastRTPS delay\
    \ is similar to\nPahoMQTT delay, but has more scatter. Te maximums of\nthe former\
    \ are several times larger than the latter. Tereby,\nRabbitMQ shows the best results.\
    \ GlassFish shows message\nsize-independent results, but with high delays.\n4.2.4.\
    \ Estimation of the Jitter Value and Minimum Delays.\nIn Figures 10 and 11, a\
    \ graph of the delay of the minimum\nmessage size is shown. Tat delay corresponds\
    \ to the\nminimal one because there is no or minimal user data. In\nTable 4, the\
    \ latency, jitter, and RTT for all frameworks are\nshown. As can be seen from\
    \ the graph and table, GlassFish\nhas the highest delay of about 2.5 milliseconds\
    \ with jumps\nover 20 milliseconds. Jitter is also high, at about half a\nmillisecond.\
    \ Tis looks like a bold line on the graph. Tis is a\nbad result, because there\
    \ are no other messages or any large\ndata transmission. So, only one message\
    \ containing protocol\ninformation is processed, and it takes a few milliseconds.\
    \ It is\nalso very unstable, because the delay scatter is about 1\nmillisecond.\
    \ RTTis also high, over 5 milliseconds on a mean.\nTat means that the receiver\
    \ has to wait about 5 milliseconds\nto get a reply from another client. Hence,\
    \ it is also a poor\nresult. FastRTPS has the lowest delay of 300 microseconds\n\
    and jitter of 30 microseconds, which is the best result. But\nthere are jumps\
    \ over 2 milliseconds. Tis is not good and can\nbe critical in some cases. RTT\
    \ is about 2.5 milliseconds on a\nmean. But the maximum of RTT is below the GlassFish\
    \ RTT\nmean, so this again indicates that the GlassFish results are\npoor. PahoMQTT\
    \ + Mosquitto graph is similar to the\nFastRTPS graph. Both of them are thin lines\
    \ in the graph.\nBut PahoMQTT has twice the delay on the mean. Te jitter\nmaximum\
    \ of PahoMQTT is also higher. Te RTT mean of\nPahoMQTT is lower than the mean\
    \ of FastRTPS, but the\nmaximum of the former is higher than the latter. Te\n\
    RabbitMQ graph shows frequent jumps over 2 milliseconds\nwhile the mean is about\
    \ 1 millisecond. Tis is bad because\nthe real mean ranges up to 2 milliseconds\
    \ which is similar to\nGlassFish. Tere are also abnormal jumps of up to 16\nmilliseconds.\
    \ RabbitMQ RTT is about 3 milliseconds which\nis neither good nor bad. But the\
    \ maximum of RTTis up to 20\nmilliseconds, which is also a problem.\nAccording\
    \ to the results, FastRTPS shows the best\nminimal delays that are less than 0.5\
    \ milliseconds. It also has\nthe best jitter value of a few tens of microseconds.\n\
    PahoMQTT with Mosquitto broker also shows good min-\nimal delays and jitter values\
    \ that are very close to those of\nFastRTPS. GlassFish has worse minimal delay\
    \ and jitter\nvalues. RabbitMQ has better results than the previous one,\nbut\
    \ it has a large scatter, which can be seen on the graph.\n4.2.5. Evaluation of\

    \ and GlassFish. Te results are quite diferent\nsince FastRTPS and RabbitMQ handle\
    \ such a data fow and\ndo not accumulate a queue at any message size. And in the\n\
    case of GlassFish, the queue appears at the smallest message\nsize and varies\
    \ throughout the test in the range from 0 to 14\nmessages. Te queue appears already\
    \ at 400 messages per\nsecond. Tat is, problems with GlassFish already appear\n\
    when transmitting about 1.2 MB per second.\nIn the case of Mosquitto and PahoMQTT,\
    \ the results are\nvery ambiguous, because, at a frequency of more than 400\n\
    messages per second, the delay increases to seconds, as can\nbe replaced in Figure13.\
    \ Tis is due to the long execution of\nthe message receiving function consume_message\
    \ (see Fig-\nure 14). Figure 15 shows a graph of the execution time of the\nread\
    \ function provided by the PahoMQTT library API.\nDue to the execution of the\
    \ message receiving function,\nthe receiving time is set later, since our system\
    \ examines the\ntime when the message is transmitted from the user’s\nsending\
    \ point to the receiving point by another user, and not\nthe time when the message\
    \ is received by the operating\nsystem or the broker, or when the message appears\
    \ in the\nqueue at the destination point. Te time at the beginning of\nthe test\
    \ is about 1 ms, which in the context of a large density\nof received messages\
    \ greatly increases the queue and reduces\nthe data transfer rate. Te testing\
    \ system does not afect these\ndelays in any way, but only created conditions\
    \ under which\nthis implementation shows a terrible result.\nWe can calculate\
    \ the amount of data transmitted at a\nfrequency of 1000 messages per second on\
    \ the last 300\nmessages, where the payload size reaches the maximum (see\nequation\
    \ (1)).\nBandwidth \x1F 1.8 MB · 1000 msgs\nsec\n\x1F 1.8 GB\nsec .\n(1)\nFastRTPS\
    \ and RabbitMQ cope with this load, although\nthe delays vary, and in the case\
    \ of FastRTPS, it is no more\nthan 8 ms, and in the case of RabbitMQ, it is no\
    \ more than\n30 ms. Te rest of the implementations cannot withstand this\nload\
    \ and do not have time to process the queue, although all\nimplementations run\
    \ in a loop with an interval of 1 ms. Tat\nis, checking for new data with an interval\
    \ of 1 ms, which in\nthe worst case will give an additional delay of 1 ms. Tis\
    \ can\nhappen if the message is located in the recipient exactly after\nthe end\
    \ of the check for the presence of the message. Tis\ninterval was chosen to reduce\
    \ the load on the CPU.\nGlassFish simply does not have time to transmit and\n\
    process such a data stream, and in the case of MQTT, the\nreasons for the long\
    \ wait to receive data have not been\ninvestigated, but may be related to the\
    \ load on the broker or\nthe long processing of data on the client. It is worth\
    \ noting\nthat these results may not apply to any situation where\nmessages are\

    Next, the dependence of RTT on the number of pairs of\ninteracting processes is\

    \ in\ncomparison with each other. From the test, we want to\nconsider the behavior\
    \ of diferent pairs of processes and the\nefect of the number of pairs on delays.\
    \ Te frequency of\nsending messages is 400 messages per second, which gives a\n\
    fairly large data stream, but this does not create conditions to\naccumulate a\
    \ huge queue for each of the considered\nimplementations.\nFigure 16 shows the\
    \ RTT graph for FastRTPS with three\npairs of interacting processes. Te jumps\
    \ on the charts are\nparticularly noticeable in the area of every 300 messages,\n\
    since it is with this frequency that the message size increases.\nJumps are associated\
    \ with the reallocation of memory for the\nbufer, which creates additional delays.\
    \ Te RTTtime for any\nmessage size does not exceed 6 ms, with the greatest delays\n\
    being achieved in the middle of the test with a message size\nof 0.7 MB. By the\
    \ end of sending data of a certain size, the\ndelays are reduced. Tis phenomenon\
    \ can be explained by\nthe fact that when the message size changes, a small queue\
    \ of\nseveral messages appears, which adds a signifcant part of the\nRTT, and\
    \ by the end of sending the next 300 messages, the\nqueue goes away and the delays\
    \ fall to their real values. At the\nend of the test, the delay is less than in\

    \ pairs is very similar, although\nthe RTT value of each pair is not as close\
    \ as in the case of\nFastRTPS. Tis software solution cannot cope with the load\n\
    of one pair of interacting processes, and as the number of\nprocesses increases,\
    \ the load increases many times and the\nqueue quickly accumulates.\nTe results\

    \ with a large message size, RTTreaches\nhundreds of seconds.\nTe behavior of\
    \ these two implementations does not\nmeet the requirements of real-time systems.\n\
    RabbitMQ, in turn, showed similar FastRTPS results\nwith random outliers and the\
    \ same behavior of process pairs,\nbut a noticeable increase in latency from one\
    \ case to three,\nwhich can also be seen in Figure 19.\n4.2.6. Investigation of\
    \ Delays in Artifcially Fixing the Message\nQueue. Consider the case of sending\
    \ messages of 10 bytes\nwithout an interval with the maximum possible frequency,\n\
    but we limit the queue to 50 messages. First, the state of the\nqueue during the\
    \ test was considered. As a result, FastRTPS\nkept the queue state at the level\
    \ of 50 messages almost\nthroughout the entire test, but there were rare single\
    \ jumps\nwhen the queue was empty and abruptly accumulated back.\nTe state of\
    \ the GlassFish queue turned out to be quite\nunstable and constantly fuctuated\
    \ from a few messages to\n50, similar to RabbitMQ, but in the range from 0 to\
    \ 30\nmessages. Tis situation is explained by the fact that the\nqueue is calculated\
    \ based on the diference between the\nnumber of messages sent and the number of\
    \ messages re-\nceived, and it takes time to transmit a response message. In\n\
    addition, the check for new messages occurs at intervals of\n1 ms, which also\
    \ gives time to process the queue.\nIn the case of PahoMQTTwith Mosquitto, the\
    \ queue did\nnot rise more than six messages and did not have time to\naccumulate,\
    \ because one node did not have time to send data\nwith sufcient frequency. Tis\
    \ is also because this imple-\nmentation waits for the message delivery information\
    \ to be\nreceived before sending a new one. Terefore, this solution\ndoes not\
    \ make sense to compare with the others, since it is in\ndiferent conditions.\
    \ But when testing the case without\nwaiting for this information, the queue jumps\
    \ in the range\nfrom 0 to 35 messages and the delay does not exceed 2 ms,\nand\
    \ the mean delay value was 0.5 ms. Tis result is the best\namong all the studied\
    \ implementations.\nFigure 20 shows the delays of each implementation, as\nthe\
    \ result of FastRTPS showed the best result with a delay of\nabout 6 ms, GlassFish\
    \ showed a huge spread of values, and if\nwe consider the peak delay and the state\
    \ of the queue of 50\nmessages, it turns out that it took 120 ms to deliver 50\
    \ small\nmessages, which is a terrible indicator. RabbitMQ turned out\nto be worse\
    \ and not as stable as FastRTPS; on average, the\ndelay of this implementation\
    \ was less than 10 ms with a\nqueue state of less than 30 messages. With a smaller\
    \ queue,\nthe delays were greater than those of FastRTPS.\n4.3.ResultComparison.\
    \ A lot of papers have pointed out that\nDDS is the best solution for real-time\
    \ data transmission. Te\nauthors of [26] compared popular protocols based on the-\n\
    oretical information. Tey concluded that the problem of\ntransferring data many\
    \ to many in real-time DDS is the best\nsolution.\nTe authors of [14] showed that\
    \ DDS is one of the leaders\nin delivery performance. Teir result for DDS at payload\
    \ size\n2 B coincides with our result obtained in the fourth scenario\n(Section\
    \ 4.2.4). Tere is a diference of 2 milliseconds be-\ncause in our experimental\
    \ setup each node performs an\nincoming message check only once every 1 millisecond.\n\
    Terefore, the additional delay is up to 2 milliseconds for\nRTT.\nA comparison\
    \ of protocols using the Anglova scenario\nwas conducted in [27]. Te results show\
    \ that the DDS\nimplemented with OpenDDS has a lower latency and jitter\ncompared\
    \ to RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ.\nA comparison of FastRTPS and ROS-MQTT was made\nin\
    \ [28]. Te results show that the average FastRTPS latency\nfor an empty message\
    \ is 620 microseconds. Tis is close to\nour result in the third scenario (Section\
    \ 4.2.3), where\nFastRTPS has an average latency of 570 microseconds for a\n128\
    \ B message size. But the other results do not match\nbecause the authors are\
    \ experimenting on a more complex\narchitecture with networked data transmission,\
    \ while our\nscenarios are run on a single machine. Tis is also true for the\n\
    MQTT results. But overall, results show that FastRTPS has\nan advantage over MQTT\
    \ which is coincident with our\nresults.\nTe authors of [29] compared the popular\
    \ protocols in\nterms of performance in eHealth solutions. Tey considered\nprotocols\
    \ from a diferent angle, but the results coincide with\nours: DDS is the best\

    \ latency, followed by AMQP, then JMS, and\nﬁnally MQTT, which showed a very poor\
    \ latency. Te au-\nthors have summarized their results in a comparative table\n\
    with the strengths and weaknesses of each protocol. But in\nthis table, JMS has\
    \ strong points such as “low latency” and\n“suitable for real-time applications.”\
    \ Tis looks very strange,\nbecause DDS does not have “low latency” in the strengths,\n\
    but has lower latency in the results, and AMQP has “not\nsuitable for real-time\
    \ applications” in the weaknesses, but\nthe results show that AMQP is the same\
    \ or better than JMS.\nAn analysis of MQTT, CoAP, and XMPP was performed in\n\
    [30]. In this study, real data, such as temperature, humidity,\nand light, were\
    \ sent 100 times for each protocol. Te results\nshow that the average delay of\
    \ MQTT is about 589 micro-\nseconds. Tis is better than the average delay of CoAP\
    \ (821\nmicroseconds) and XMPP (41 milliseconds). Since the tem-\nperature, humidity,\
    \ and light data are lightweight and the\ntransmission was in one direction, the\
    \ MQTTresult is the same\nas the results obtained in the third scenario (Section\
    \ 4.2.3): 640\nmicroseconds for MQTT with a message size of 128B.\nTe MQTTresult\
    \ in the third scenario is also the same as\nthe result from [31], where MQTT\
    \ has a latency of 1 to 1.5\nmilliseconds. Te diﬀerence of two times may be caused\
    \ by\nthe packet transmission time over the network, in contrast to\nour experimental\
    \ setup where all components (publisher,\nbroker, and subscriber) are placed on\
    \ the same machine.\nTere are a lot of comparisons between AMQP and\nMQTT. In\
    \ [32], the authors compared the RTT of AMQP\nand MQTT. Te results show that MQTT\
    \ is slightly better\nthan AMQP: the RTT of AMQP is about 700 microseconds\nand\
    \ the RTT of MQTT is about 500 microseconds. Tis\ncoincides with the RTT results\
    \ from the fourth scenario\n(Section 4.2.4). Te diﬀerence of a few milliseconds\
    \ is\nexplained by the fact that in our experimental setup all\nreceiving nodes\
    \ work in a 1-millisecond wait cycle, which\ncauses an additional delay of up\
    \ to 2 milliseconds in this\nscenario. Other small time diﬀerences may be caused\
    \ by the\noperating system or diﬀerent versions of the frameworks.\nIn [33], the\
    \ authors also compare the RTT for AMQP\nand MQTT and show that AMQP is better\
    \ in most cases.\nMost measured values for AMQP and MQTT range from 2\nmilliseconds\
    \ to 6 milliseconds. Tese results are matched by\nour results for the fourth scenario\
    \ (Section 4.2.4). But in our\nresults, MQTT is slightly better than AMQP, in\
    \ contrast to\nthe conclusion in [33]. Te cause for this may be that the\nauthors\
    \ used the Python programming language, the\nRaspberry PI, or the pika library\
    \ for the AMQP broker.\nIn [34], the authors show that AMQP and MQTT have\nthe\
    \ same delay (MQTT is slightly better). Since the authors\ndid not provide a detailed\
    \ description of the test scenario, it\nis diﬃcult to compare with our results,\
    \ but it is similar to the\nresults of the third scenario (Section 4.2.3), where\
    \ AMQP\nand MQTT have similar delays for message sizes up to 1 MB.\nIn [35], AMQP\
    \ and MQTT delays were compared for\ndiﬀerent scenarios: sending data from weather\
    \ sensors and\nsending data from city cameras. Te results show that for\nscenarios\
    \ with sensors, MQTT has a lower delay (less than 1\nmillisecond) than AMQP. Since\
    \ sensor data are lightweight,\nthis is coincident with the results obtained in\
    \ the third\nscenario (Section 4.2.3) with a message size of 128 B, where\nMQTT\
    \ has an average delay of 640 microseconds. But for the\nscenario with cameras,\
    \ the result is reversed, with AMQP\nhaving a lower delay (less than 13 milliseconds).\
    \ Tis is also\ncoincident with the results obtained in the third scenario\n(Section\
    \ 4.2.3): as the message size increases, MQTT shows\nhigher latency compared to\
    \ AMQP.\nTe authors of [36] also concluded that MQTT is better\nsuited for small\
    \ message sizes. Teir results show that MQTT\nhas lower latency (from 400 microseconds\
    \ to 500 micro-\nseconds) than AMQP (from 800 microseconds to 1100\nmicroseconds)\
    \ for message sizes up to 4096 B. Tis is\nmatched by our results obtained in the\
    \ third scenario\n(Section 4.2.3) with a message size of 128 B. Te latency in\n\
    our results is higher because the network speed is less than\n1 GB/s and the broker\
    \ has lower system characteristics. Te\nauthors also experimented a 5000-message\
    \ sending rate and\nmessage size of 64 B. Tis is very close to the ﬁrst scenario,\n\
    where messages are sent without intervals. Te results are\nmatched: latency increases\
    \ throughout the scenario.\n5. Conclusions\nDescribed protocols are diﬀerent in\
    \ initial purposes. JMS is a\nsimple standard for messaging in Java programs,\
    \ that does\nnot specify messaging mechanics. MQTT and AMQP are\nprotocols for\
    \ messaging using queues that diﬀer in some\ndetails. RTPS has a purpose to make\
    \ real-time messaging\navailable to its users by having more strict rules. For\
    \ real-\ntime systems, the best protocols are MQTT and RTPS.\nMQTTis good at transmitting\
    \ small messages, while RTPS is\na more versatile and ﬂexible protocol with more\
    \ options for\nchanging the QoS.\nTe article presents a methodology that allows\
    \ to in-\nvestigate the software delays of solutions in various con-\nditions,\
    \ but the conditions of the study have limitations:\n(i) Te interval for checking\
    \ new messages is 1 ms,\nwhich in the worst case can give an error of 1 ms;\n\
    (ii) Testing was carried out on a single machine using\nnetwork data transfer\
    \ protocols, but minimizing the\nimpact of network delays. Tus, it is assumed\
    \ that\nthe network is stable, although the instability of the\nnetwork can greatly\
    \ aﬀect the result [37];\n(iii) Te test from Section 3.1.2 uses a fairly small\n\
    number of simultaneously running subscribers;\n(iv) All tests are aimed at investigating\
    \ the delays in-\ntroduced by the middleware;\n(v) In the developed methodology,\
    \ nonstandard be-\nhavior of nodes was stimulated, for example in-\ncreasing the\
    \ size of transmitted data during one test,\nwhich is not typical.\nConsidering\
    \ the results, GlassFish is the best solution for\nmessage sending without intervals.\
    \ It can be used in systems\n16\nJournal of Computer Networks and Communications\n\
    with a lot of messages, where other solutions will be too slow.\nBut in all other\
    \ cases, it has the worst results and cannot\ncompete with other solutions.\n\
    Paho is very good at transferring messages of minimum\nsize. It could be a good\
    \ solution for systems with very small\nmessages, such as commands that can be\
    \ presented as few\nbytes.\nRabbitMQ is one of the fastest solutions. It shows\
    \ itself\ngood in all cases, except in sending messages without an\ninterval.\
    \ RabbitMQ is the best at sending messages with a big\nsize and with multiple\
    \ subscribers.\nFastRTPS is almost the best solution. Tere is only one\nproblem—message\
    \ processing without an interval between\nsending messages. FastRTPS has the most\
    \ stable delays\nwhich makes it predictable. It is very important in real-time\n\
    systems.\nIn IoT systems almost all investigated cases are pre-\nsented. RabbitMQ\
    \ and FastRTPS are good in most cases and\nshould be considered ﬁrstly. RabbitMQ\
    \ should be used in\nsystems with big messages and a lot of consumers of the\n\
    same data. FastRTPS should be used in real-time systems,\nwhere delays have low\
    \ jitter and are bounded by a constant\nvalue. Te usage of GlassFish and Paho\
    \ is more limited. Tey\nshould be used only in special cases, such as too frequent\n\
    message sending and low-size data transferring.\nWhen building a system with various\
    \ data, which in-\ncludes both small command messages and large amounts of\ndata\
    \ from sensors, cameras, etc., the RTPS protocol shows\nitself in the best way.\
    \ But none of the software solutions\nconsidered by us provides guarantees of\
    \ delivery in iso-\nchronous mode, and in all cases, in certain situations, there\n\
    are unpredictable jumps and the accompanying growth of\nthe message queue. To\
    \ provide real guarantees, it is necessary\nto use link-layer protocols that provide\
    \ appropriate capa-\nbilities and guarantees, since the application layer is highly\n\
    dependent on external factors.\nData Availability\nNo data were used to support\
    \ this study.\nConflicts of Interest\nTe authors declare that they have no conﬂicts\

    popularity and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to serious
    security concerns. The integration of a security operations center (SOC) becomes
    increasingly important in this situation to ensure the security of IoT devices.
    In this article, we will present a summary of IoT device security issues, their
    vulnerabilities, a review of current challenges to keep these devices secure,
    and discuss the role that SOC can bring in protecting IoT devices while considering
    the challenges encountered and the directions to consider when implementing a
    reliable SOC for IoT monitoring. Published in: 2023 12th Mediterranean Conference

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Budva, Montenegro I. Introduction In the
    21st century, we can hardly do any services or business without an online presence.
    Despite the many benefits of online digital presence of businesses, we can see
    many incidents of online digital presence. We can see hackers constantly trying
    to hack data from companies and different services. It''s like war; hackers are
    more active and smarter at stealing data. Cyberattacks can last a long time or
    for a short time, it can be overly sensitive government information as well as
    small private companies [1]. In addition, the massive evolution of connected objects
    in Internet of Things (IoT) environment that currently amount to more than 15
    billion objects, and which is predicted to become more than 19 billion in 2025.

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    \ The Ogallala Aquifer has experienced a continuous decline in water levels due\
    \ to decades\nof irrigation pumping with minimal recharge. Corn is one of the\
    \ major irrigated crops in the\nsemi-arid Northern High Plains (NHP) of Texas.\n\
    Selection of less water-intensive crops may\nprovide opportunities for groundwater\
    \ conservation. Modeling the long-term hydrologic impacts\nof alternative crops\
    \ can be a time-saving and cost-effective alternative to ﬁeld-based experiments.\n\
    A newly developed management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling algorithm\
    \ for\nSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in this study. The impacts\
    \ of irrigated farming,\ndryland farming, and continuous fallow on water conservation\
    \ were evaluated. Results indicated\nthat simulated irrigation, evapotranspiration,\
    \ and crop yield were representative of the measured\ndata. Approximately 19%,\
    \ 21%, and 32% reductions in annual groundwater uses were associated\nwith irrigated\
    \ soybean, sunﬂower, and sorghum, respectively, as compared to irrigated corn.\
    \ On\naverage, annual soil water depletion was more than 52 mm for dryland farming\
    \ scenarios. In contrast,\nonly 18 mm of soil water was lost to evaporation annually,\
    \ for the long-term continuous fallow\nsimulation. The fallow scenario also showed\
    \ 31 mm of percolation for aquifer recharge.\nKeywords: SWAT; evapotranspiration;\

    \ a crucial groundwater source for agricultural production in the\nsemi-arid Texas\
    \ High Plains (THP). This region is one of the most productive irrigated agricultural\n\
    regions in the United States (U.S.). However, decades of irrigation pumping combined\
    \ with limited\nrecharge has led to reduced water levels in the aquifer, resulting\
    \ in decreased well capacities.\nThe saturated thickness of the aquifer generally\
    \ decreases in a southward gradient across the\nTHP (Figure 1). Differences in\
    \ associated pumping capacities effectively divides the THP into two\nagricultural\
    \ production regions, the Northern High Plains (NHP) and the Southern High Plains\
    \ (SHP).\nThe SHP consists of 16 counties extending from northwest of Lubbock\
    \ to Midland, while the NHP\nHydrology 2018, 5, 53; doi:10.3390/hydrology5040053\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/hydrology\nHydrology 2018, 5, 53\n2 of 16\nregion is comprised\
    \ of the 25 northernmost counties of the Texas Panhandle. The saturated thickness\n\
    of the aquifer and associated well capacities in each region directly inﬂuence\
    \ land use and crop\ncomposition. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is the major\
    \ cultivated crop in the SHP, which produces\nnearly one-third of all U.S. cotton\
    \ [1]. Currently, grain corn (Zea mays L.) is the dominant irrigated crop\ngrown\
    \ in the NHP, and several counties have reported some of the largest average corn\
    \ yields in the\nnation [1]. However, production of relatively water-intensive\
    \ corn in this semi-arid environment often\nrequires large amounts of supplemental\
    \ irrigation, as in-season precipitation is inadequate, variable,\nand unpredictable.\n\

    \ regulations have been enacted in major portions of the THP for restricting annual\n\
    irrigation withdrawals to mitigate depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer [2]. In response\
    \ to these regulations,\nmany producers have expressed increased interest in crops\
    \ with reduced water requirements or\neven conversion to dryland farming [3].\n\
    Less water-intensive crops, such as cotton, soybean\n(Glycine max L.), sunﬂower\
    \ (Helianthus annuus L.), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), winter wheat\n(Triticum\
    \ aestivum L.), and others are of interest. For example, drought-tolerant crops,\
    \ such as cotton,\ngrain sorghum, and winter wheat, are less sensitive to water\
    \ stress and can produce proﬁtable yields\nunder both limited irrigation and dryland\
    \ conditions [4,5]. Although less drought tolerant than\nwheat and sorghum, soybean\
    \ is adapted to drought conditions because photosynthesis continues\nat lower\
    \ leaf-water potentials [6], and yield is less sensitive to water deﬁcit during\
    \ the vegetative\nstage [7]. Sunﬂowers are characterized by deep and extensive\
    \ root systems, which can extract water\nand nutrients from the soil proﬁle as\
    \ deep as 3.0 m [8–10]. This allows sunﬂowers to survive in even\nsevere drought\
    \ conditions. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS),\
    \ 47% of all\ncultivated agricultural land in the THP was classiﬁed as dryland\
    \ in 2017 [1]. Dryland crop production\nin the THP is expected to increase as\
    \ groundwater levels continue to decline and competition for\nother uses increases\
    \ [11]. Accurate crop-speciﬁc water requirements and their respective impacts\
    \ on\ngroundwater depletion are useful for selecting viable and proﬁtable alternative\
    \ crops in the NHP.\nHydrology 2018, 5, 53\n3 of 16\nLong-term ﬁeld experiments\
    \ for determining irrigation requirements of various crops are time\nconsuming\
    \ and costly. Computational modeling programs are especially useful for studying\
    \ long-term\neffects of crop or land use selections on hydrology [12]. Modeling\
    \ applications also mitigate the time\nand ﬁnancial resources needed to evaluate\
    \ alternative agricultural land use options compared to\nthe ﬁeld experiments.\
    \ However, adequate model parameterization and representative agronomic\nalgorithms\
    \ are required for meaningful simulation and interpretation of results. Past modeling\n\
    attempts have been unable to adequately simulate irrigation strategies that use\
    \ management allowed\ndepletion (MAD) scheduling, an approach used by producers\
    \ in the THP and in the arid and semi-arid\nclimates around the world [13–18].\n\
    The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a physically-based, semi-distributed,\
    \ watershed-\nscale hydrologic model [19]. Primary model inputs include elevation\
    \ information, land use and cover,\nsoil properties, climate conditions, and management\
    \ practices such as tillage, planting date, fertilizer\napplication, irrigation\
    \ scheduling, and harvest date [20]. Recently, Chen et al. [21] developed and\n\
    tested a new auto-irrigation algorithm for simulating MAD irrigation scheduling\
    \ with the SWAT model\nusing ten years of measured irrigation, evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET), and crop growth data from lysimeter\nﬁelds at the USDA-ARS Conservation\
    \ and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL), Bushland, Texas.\nThe MAD-based algorithm\
    \ more accurately simulated irrigation practices typical of the THP and\noutperformed\
    \ the default auto-irrigation functions in SWAT [21]. The improved algorithm allows\
    \ for a\nuser deﬁned depletion of plant available water to occur before irrigations\
    \ are triggered. In addition,\nthe MAD algorithm suspends irrigation after crop\
    \ harvest. However, when using the SWAT default\nsoil water content auto-irrigation\
    \ method, irrigation may still occur after crop harvest, resulting in\nthe overestimation\
    \ of seasonal irrigation [22,23]. These reﬁnements allow for improved simulation\
    \ of\nirrigation practices that result in more accurate representation of long-term\
    \ land use scenarios under\nirrigated conditions.\nAltering crop composition or\
    \ changing a land use regime (e.g., irrigated farming, dryland farming,\nor fallow\
    \ with bare soil conditions) in the THP may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the water budget\
    \ by altering\nproportions of irrigation, ET, soil water content, and groundwater\
    \ recharge. For example, using the\nSWAT model, Luan et al. [24] predicted an\
    \ 8% increase in annual ET in the Hetao irrigation district of\nChina due to a\
    \ change in land use from wheat to corn. VanLoocke et al. [25] also reported that\
    \ land\nuse conversion from corn to perennial grasses would increase ET by up\
    \ to 150 mm yr−1 and decrease\nstreamﬂow by 250 mm yr−1 in the Corn Belt of U.S.\
    \ Midwest. However, long-term assessments of the\nwater use impacts of land use\
    \ scenarios are lacking for arid/semi-arid regions, such as the THP, due to\n\
    limited ﬁeld-based data [26]. In addition, no study has provided a comprehensive\
    \ assessment of water\nbalance for long-term continuous fallow conditions.\nThe\
    \ primary goal of this study was to assess the impacts of multiple land use scenarios\
    \ of irrigated\nfarming, dryland farming, and entire-year fallow on ET, soil water\
    \ content, and crop yield in the\nNHP region. Speciﬁcally, the objectives of this\
    \ study were to: (1) determine the appropriateness of\nvarious crops including\
    \ corn, winter wheat, cotton, soybean, sunﬂower, sorghum under irrigated and\n\
    dryland farming conditions in the NHP; and (2) quantify the effects of long-term\
    \ continuous fallow on\ngroundwater recharge and soil water depletion.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\n2.1. Study Site\nThe study site is located at the USDA-ARS CPRL\
    \ at Bushland, Texas (35.2◦ N, 102.1◦ W, ~1170 m\nabove mean sea level). The regional\
    \ climate is classiﬁed as the semi-arid with average annual rainfall\nand temperature\
    \ of 496 mm and 14.1 ◦C, respectively for years 2001–2010. The dominant soil is\n\
    classiﬁed as Pullman clay loam (ﬁne, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Paleustoll)\
    \ [27]. Selected\nsoil properties are provided in Table 1. The study site is relatively\

    \ a large weighing lysimeter situated\nin its center, was selected as the study\
    \ site (Figure 1). Climate data were obtained from an adjacent\nresearch-grade\
    \ weather station maintained to the American Society of Civil Engineers-Environmental\n\
    and Water Resources Institute (ASCE-EWRI) speciﬁcations [28]. Irrigated ﬁeld crops\
    \ grown from 1996\nto 2016 included alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), cotton, soybean,\
    \ grain, and forage sorghum, sunﬂower,\nand grain and forage corn. Dryland crops\
    \ included grain sorghum, cotton, soybean, and sunﬂower\n(Table 2). A N–S oriented\
    \ linear move sprinkler system was used to apply water to the east irrigated\n\
    lysimeter ﬁeld. The west lysimeter ﬁeld was managed as dryland with fallow years\
    \ of 1996, 2002,\n2005, and 2009. Management of fallow ﬁeld included weed control\
    \ operations, including tillage and\nherbicide treatments as needed. Fertilizer\

    \ information and the soil data for the study site were obtained from the U.S.\
    \ Geological\nSurvey (USGS) and Web Soil Survey [29], respectively. All management\
    \ information, including tillage,\nplanting, fertilizer applications, harvest,\
    \ etc., were recorded for each ﬁeld for every year. Irrigation\namounts and application\
    \ dates were also recorded. Climatic data, including precipitation, maximum\n\
    air temperature, minimum air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed were\naggregated into daily values for modeling input.\nHydrology\
    \ 2018, 5, 53\n5 of 16\nCrop LAI samples were collected periodically during the\
    \ growing season by destructive sampling.\nLeaf samples were measured using a\
    \ digital scanning bed leaf area meter (model LI-3100, LI-COR,\nLincoln, Nebraska).\
    \ LAI values were calculated as the ratio of upper side leaf area (m2) to the\
    \ ground\narea (m2). Final yield was determined by both combine harvest and hand\
    \ harvest sampling at the\nend of the growing season. Speciﬁcally, agronomic data\
    \ collected from the east lysimeter ﬁeld from\n2000 to 2010 were used for SWAT\
    \ inputs. Actual irrigation frequency and magnitude data were input\ninto SWAT\
    \ using the manual irrigation function and the schedule by speciﬁc date method.\
    \ Daily ET,\nseasonal LAI, and ﬁnal crop yield from 2001 to 2010 were used to\
    \ calibrate and validate the SWAT\nmodel for the irrigated conditions [26]. Analyses\
    \ of long-term alternative land use scenarios using\nthe newly developed MAD auto-irrigation\
    \ function [21] were performed in this study. Measured\ndata from the west lysimeter\
    \ ﬁeld from 2001 to 2010 were used to calibrate and validate SWAT under\ndryland\
    \ conditions [30].\n2.3. Lysimetric ET Data Collection\nEach lysimeter contains\
    \ an undisturbed soil monolith collected on site, weighing ~45 Mg including\n\
    the container mass.\nThe lysimeter surface dimensions are 3 m × 3 m (9 m2) with\
    \ a depth of\n2.3 m [31]. The accuracy of ET measurements has ranged from 0.05\
    \ mm to 0.01 mm when expressed\nas an equivalent depth of water [32,33]. Experienced\
    \ technicians and scientists work to ensure that\nthe lysimeters are as representative\
    \ of the surrounding ﬁelds as possible. Lysimeter design and\nmanagement are described\
    \ in detail by Marek et al. [31]. Daily ET (mm) is calculated using the\nfollowing\
    \ soil water balance equation:\nET = I + P − R − F − ∆SW\n(1)\nwhere I is irrigation\
    \ (mm; assigned a value of zero for dryland lysimeter), P is precipitation (mm),\n\
    R is surface runoff (assigned a value of zero due to lysimeter freeboard and furrow\
    \ diking in the\nsurrounding ﬁelds), F is water ﬂux exiting the lysimeter storage\
    \ volume (mm), and ∆SW is the\nchange in soil water content (mm), calculated as\
    \ the difference between the midnight-centered average\nlysimeter mass of the\
    \ current and previous day. The lysimeters are equipped with vacuum drainage\n\
    systems, which collect soil proﬁle drainage into tanks suspended from the bottom\
    \ of the lysimeters.\nAs such, drainage does not inﬂuence overall lysimeter mass\
    \ and subsequent ET measurements except\nwhen the tanks are periodically drained.\
    \ Therefore, F is assigned to zero. Mass-changing events such\nas this are ﬂagged\
    \ and adjusted in the lysimeter mass datasets. Missing or spurious data resulting\n\
    from the days of lysimeter calibration, maintenance, agronomic activities, and\
    \ power outages were\nnot used. Detailed lysimeter data processing and data quality\
    \ assurance/quality control (QA/QC)\nprocedures are provided by Marek et al. [34].\n\
    2.4. Default and Management Allowed Depletion Auto-Irrigation Functions in SWAT\n\
    The default SWAT auto-irrigation functions allow for irrigation based on (1) plant\
    \ water demand\nor (2) soil water content. Using the soil water content method,\
    \ irrigation is triggered whenever the soil\nwater in the proﬁle falls below ﬁeld\
    \ capacity by more than a user-deﬁned soil water deﬁcit threshold.\nThe alternative\
    \ MAD auto-irrigation function triggers an irrigation when a user-deﬁned percentage\n\
    of plant available water is depleted. Plant available water is determined by soil\
    \ proﬁle texture and\ncrop-speciﬁc maximum rooting depth [21].\nArcSWAT was developed\
    \ by Stone Environmental, Inc.\nin collaboration with Texas A&M\nSpatial Sciences\
    \ Laboratory and Backland Research and Extension Center. ArcSWAT 2012 (version\n\
    2012.10_2.19; revision 664) modiﬁed with the MAD-based auto-irrigation function\
    \ was used in this\nstudy. Two SWAT projects, one calibrated for ET, LAI, and\
    \ crop yield for the east irrigated lysimeter\nﬁeld [21,26], and the other for\
    \ west dryland lysimeter ﬁeld [30], were used in this study for the\nHydrology\
    \ 2018, 5, 53\n6 of 16\nanalysis of alternative land use scenarios. Both SWAT\
    \ projects were structured as 11-year (2000–2010)\ncontinuous simulations. In\
    \ both projects, the ﬁrst year (2000) was used for the model warmup.\n2.5. Scenario\
    \ Design and Assessment of Land Use Scenarios\nThe effects of three land use regimes\
    \ including irrigated farming, dryland farming, and continuous\nfallow on water\
    \ conservation were evaluated. Speciﬁcally, twelve agricultural land use scenarios\
    \ for\nthe 2000–2010 simulation period were evaluated. They consisted of irrigated\
    \ farming scenarios of\ngrain corn, winter wheat, cotton, soybean, sunﬂower, and\
    \ grain sorghum. Dryland farming scenarios\nconsisted of winter wheat, cotton,\
    \ soybean, sunﬂower, and grain sorghum, as well as an entire-year\nfallow (Table\
    \ 3).\nTable 3. Long-term crop management information under the land use scenarios.\n\

    \ in the irrigated scenarios. The average values of the calibrated crop growth\n\
    parameters from the two SWAT projects [21,26,30], in addition to other literature\
    \ from Bushland studies,\nwere used to parameterize the crop database for the\
    \ land use scenarios (Supplementary Materials\nTable S1). The SWAT outputs for\

    3.1. Comparison of Simulated Irrigation, ET, and Crop Yield with Observed Data\n\
    The range of simulated seasonal irrigation using the MAD auto-irrigation function\
    \ for the\nten-year period (2001–2010) was representative of the actual irrigation\
    \ range for the same crops,\nexcept for soybean and sunﬂower, which had greater\
    \ maximums than the actual irrigation amounts\n(Table 4). Chen et al. [39] also\
    \ showed that the MAD auto-irrigation function represented well the\nmeasured\
    \ irrigation data from ﬁve states in the Southern Great Plains including Texas,\
    \ Colorado,\nKansas, Nebraska, and New Mexico. Speciﬁcally, the SWAT default soil\
    \ water content and plant\nwater demand auto-irrigation methods tended to overestimate\
    \ and underestimate seasonal irrigation,\nrespectively, when compared to the actual\
    \ MAD-based irrigation management. Simulated average\nseasonal irrigation was\
    \ the largest for corn, followed by winter wheat, cotton, soybean, sunﬂower, and\n\
    grain sorghum.\nHydrology 2018, 5, 53\n7 of 16\nTable 4. Comparison of long-term\

    \ the irrigated conditions showed that the simulated\nET range bracketed the observed\
    \ ET range. However, the continuous fallow simulation resulted in\na lower minimum\
    \ value for ET compared to actual ET. The continuous fallow simulation did not\n\
    have cropping between subsequent years (Table 5). However, the actual fallow conditions\
    \ in 2002,\n2005, and 2009 were preceded by dryland cropping in the previous year,\
    \ which resulted in low initial\nsoil moisture for evaporation in those years.\
    \ As expected, simulated average annual ET followed\nthe same descending order\
    \ as simulated irrigation with fallow scenario having the least amount of\nsimulated\
    \ ET (largely evaporation) of 457 mm (Table 5). Under dryland farming conditions,\
    \ more than\n99% of the input water from precipitation (~500 mm) was lost through\
    \ ET in this semi-arid region.\nChen et al. [37] also found that annual ET values\
    \ of all SWAT simulated cotton and bioenergy crop\nscenarios accounted for about\
    \ 99% of annual rainfall in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed\nin the\
    \ Texas High Plains. Therefore, average annual simulated ET (~500 mm) approximated\
    \ average\nannual precipitation for all dryland farming scenarios.\nTable 5. Comparison\

    range of observed yields with the exceptions of irrigated grain corn and sorghum.\
    \ Average annual\nrainfall for the 2001–2010 simulation period was around 500\
    \ mm, which approximated the long-term\nHydrology 2018, 5, 53\n8 of 16\nannual\

    \ low annual\nprecipitation with only 333 mm. Conversely, annual precipitation\
    \ was exceedingly large (928 mm) for\nthe grain sorghum grown in 2015. These conditions\
    \ likely contributed to the differences between the\nsimulated and measured yields\
    \ for irrigated grain corn and sorghum. Overall, the long-term simulated\naverage\

    \ Use, Soil Water Depletion, and Groundwater Recharge under\nDifferent Land Uses\n\
    In this study, net groundwater use was deﬁned as the groundwater used for irrigation\
    \ minus\nthe amount of percolation. Water that percolates below the plant rooting\
    \ zone can be deﬁned as\ngroundwater recharge. Under irrigated scenarios, grain\
    \ sorghum had the lowest net groundwater\nuse of 293 mm (Table 7). As expected,\
    \ irrigated grain corn showed the highest net groundwater use\nat 432 mm. In six\
    \ of the ten years of the simulation period, irrigation water for corn exceeded\
    \ the\n457 mm (18 inches) groundwater pumping restriction imposed by the High\
    \ Plains Underground Water\nConservation District [2].\nAs compared to irrigated\
    \ grain corn, irrigated winter wheat and cotton reduced net groundwater\nuse by\
    \ 5.5% and 8.3%, respectively. However, the cotton grown on the lysimeter ﬁelds\
    \ of the study\nsite was managed as full irrigation (near 100% of cotton ET requirements).\
    \ Similar management of\nwinter wheat led to larger seasonal irrigation amounts\
    \ for both crops than those typically observed\nin production agriculture from\
    \ producers, resulting in 27% and 37% reductions of irrigation water\ncompared\
    \ to corn [42]. Winter wheat is generally not fully irrigated as marginal increases\
    \ in yield do\nnot offset input costs [43]. As for cotton, water stress, deﬁned\
    \ as irrigation less than 100% of ET, can\nsupport partitioning of photosynthate\
    \ to cotton bolls (seed and lint), thereby promoting ﬁber maturity\nHydrology\
    \ 2018, 5, 53\n9 of 16\nand quality. However, reduction of irrigation generally\
    \ results in negative impacts on corn production.\nTherefore, production data\
    \ from producers revealed a ~30% reduction in irrigation water for typical\nlimited\
    \ irrigation cotton and winter wheat relative to the grain corn production in\
    \ the NHP [42].\nReductions in net groundwater use of 18.9% and 21.3% were estimated\
    \ for irrigated soybean and\nsunﬂower, respectively, compared to the irrigated\
    \ corn. A 32.2% decrease in net groundwater use was\nestimated for irrigated grain\
    \ sorghum as compared to grain corn. A land use change from corn to\nsoybean and\
    \ sunﬂower may yield a 15–20% reduction in net groundwater use in the region.\
    \ Producers\nfacing reduced well capacities may be forced to target grain sorghum\
    \ production which is estimated\nto reduce net groundwater use by more than 30%\
    \ as compared to grain corn. It is worth noting that\nsimulated irrigation water\
    \ for grain sorghum never exceeded the 457 mm restriction during the 10-year\n\
    simulation period (Table 4).\nTable 7. Comparison of different crop selection\

    There was no net groundwater use under the dryland conditions as no irrigation\
    \ water was\napplied and negligible or no percolation under the dryland conditions\
    \ in this region. However,\nit is worth noting that the continuous fallow simulation\
    \ resulted in an annual average of 31 mm\nof percolated precipitation available\
    \ for eventual groundwater recharge (Table 8). Dryland farming\nscenarios forfeited\
    \ this potential beneﬁt to groundwater conservation. In addition, annual soil\
    \ water\ndepletion ranged from 47 mm to 57 mm under the dryland cotton and sunﬂower\
    \ scenarios. However,\nan average of only 18 mm of soil water was lost in the\
    \ fallow scenario on a yearly basis. Finally,\nthe system available water loss\
    \ (groundwater and soil proﬁle water) was 60 mm more for the dryland\nfarming\
    \ scenarios compared to the fallow scenario. Obviously, fallow management precludes\
    \ the\nproduction of a crop and any associated proﬁts. However, this study is\
    \ aimed at advancing the\nunderstanding of impacts on water balance components\
    \ associated with long-term dryland and\nirrigated production, as well as continuous\
    \ fallow. Assessments of these agricultural land uses and\nmanagement practices\
    \ are limited, and the effect of long-term fallow management is largely absent\n\
    from the literature [44].\nTable 8. Comparison of different land use scenarios\

    \ Monthly ET, Irrigation, and Soil Water Content under Twelve Land Use Scenarios\n\
    A monthly analysis showed that the simulated peak ET occurred in July or August\
    \ in all irrigated\ncrops, except for irrigated winter wheat which peaked in May\
    \ (Figure 2). The peak monthly ET was\napproximately 230 mm and 180–200 mm for\
    \ irrigated grain corn and other crop scenarios, respectively.\nAs expected, simulated\
    \ monthly ET trended with irrigation scheduling. Precipitation was concentrated\n\
    from June to August in the NHP region. However, it was far lower than the alfalfa\
    \ reference ET\n(ETrs) of ~1600 mm in the region (Figure 2). Therefore, a large\
    \ amount of irrigation was supplied\nto minimize crop stress. For instance, precipitation\
    \ may only satisfy half of corn water demand in\nsome years, with the remainder\
    \ coming from irrigation. As for irrigated winter wheat, it is planted\nin the\
    \ early October, and producers typically do not irrigate until the following January,\
    \ during the\ndrought-sensitive wheat jointing period [35]. This was the reason\
    \ for a large amount of irrigation\nsimulated in January (Figure 2b). Other irrigation\
    \ events for winter wheat occurred during anthesis\nand grain ﬁlling periods from\
    \ April to June.\nPrecipitous declines in soil water content of the whole soil\
    \ proﬁle occurred from February to May\nfor the dryland winter wheat scenario\
    \ (Figure 3a). For all other summer crops, soil water content levels\ndecreased\
    \ continuously from May to September (Figure 3). However, soil water content generally\n\
    rebounded to 100–120 mm before next year’s planting through rainfall under the\
    \ dryland soybean,\nsunﬂower, and grain sorghum scenarios. The soil water content\
    \ was lower than 100 mm before planting\nfor dryland cotton (80–100 mm). It is\
    \ worth noting that the continuous fallow simulation maintained a\n300 mm soil\
    \ water content throughout the year (Figure 3f). In general, simulated dryland\
    \ winter wheat\nsustained good soil moisture conditions compared to summer crops,\
    \ primarily due to the majority\nHydrology 2018, 5, 53\n11 of 16\nof annual precipitation\
    \ occurring in July and August after the winter wheat harvest (transpiration\n\
    ceased). Similar to the continuous fallow scenario, only evaporation accounted\
    \ for the majority of\nwater lost in this summer fallow period. Recently, Holman\
    \ et al. [44] concluded that the fallow period\nwas very important for the dryland\
    \ winter wheat production according to a ﬁve-year (2007–2012)\nﬁeld experiment\
    \ in Garden City, Kansas. They found that soil available water was reduced by\
    \ 1 mm\nfor every 125 kg ha−1 of biomass of summer crop that was produced during\
    \ the summer fallow\nperiod. They also reported that for every millimeter of soil\
    \ water saved in the summer fallow period,\nwheat yield was increased by 5.5 kg\
    \ ha−1. Therefore, occasional fallow years may not only increase\ngroundwater\
    \ recharge, but also beneﬁt dryland crop production in the following year. Continuous\n\
    dryland cotton production resulted in the lowest initial soil water content at\
    \ planting, suggesting that\nsuch a scenario may beneﬁt from the occasional fallow\
    \ rotation.\nHydrology 2018, x, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n11 of 17 \n3.3. Simulated\

    \ \nPublication date: February 28th 2023 \n \n1. Introduction  \nAgriculture,\
    \ like many other industries, is undergoing a digital transformation because of\
    \ population growth, \nclimate change, and food security concerns, which necessitate\
    \ the adoption of innovative crop productivity \nmethods [33]. Agriculture's role\
    \ in climate change and global warming, on the other hand, has been the subject\
    \ \nof a long-running and contentious debate [8]. Precision agriculture drives\
    \ by technological and innovative \nmethods for efficiently managing agricultural\
    \ characteristics such as crop, soil, production, and management by \nunderstanding\
    \ the temporal and spatial changes of these aspects [45]. Agriculture makes an\
    \ important \ncontribution to the global economy [28]. Farming also plays a role\
    \ in the global socio-economic activity. \nBecause of market growth, both agricultural\
    \ research and industry are aiming for sustainable agricultural \nproductivity\
    \ [24], as well as addressing societal needs in acquiring, managing, analyzing,\
    \ visualizing, and \nutilizing data and information in dealing with cross-disciplinary\
    \ precision agriculture problems [45]. The rising \ntrend in crop demand, combined\
    \ with rising fertilizer and pesticide prices, has highlighted the need for resource-\n\
    efficient, environmentally friendly agriculture [8]. Precision farming defines\
    \ as the management of spatial and \ntemporal variability with ICT-enabled technologies\
    \ to provide food security [46]. Precision agriculture, \naccording to [14], is\
    \ a strategic approach that collects, processes, and analyzes temporal, spatial,\
    \ and individual \ndata, integrating it with other information to support managerial\
    \ decisions based on estimated variations to \nimprove utilization efficiency,\
    \ productivity, quality, profit margins, and sustainability of agricultural output.\
    \ \nPrecision agriculture is based on the idea that production inputs such as\
    \ seed, chemicals, fertilizer, and so on \nshould only be applied when and where\

    \ to make the \nbest crop variety, selection, and decisions to cope with changing\
    \ conditions, resource scarcity, and the effects of \nagricultural production\
    \ on society. Agricultural activities are a major source of income for the majority\
    \ of \nKenyans. Its practices have long been unsatisfactory in terms of yield\
    \ maximization and cost minimization due \nto an over-reliance on traditional\
    \ farming orientation. The vice is not information-driven, particularly in terms\
    \ of \nmanagement practices as inputs in terms of timing or quantification, but\
    \ most farmers rely on estimates. \nHowever, they failed to account for field\
    \ variability, resulting in resource misallocations such as under or over-\napplication\
    \ of inputs, which had a significant impact on the ecosystem and harmed production\
    \ sustainability [49]. \nThe issues have an impact on food security, requiring\
    \ farmers to adopt other effective, efficient, and \nproductive farm practices.\
    \ This is realized with precision agriculture and the adoption of novel technologies.\
    \ Soil \nvariability and crop management are critical in precision agriculture\
    \ for achieving productivity, profitability, and \nenvironmental effluence control\
    \ [15]. Agriculture is expected to meet societal values such as increased food\
    \ \nproductivity, cultural diversity, recreation, and climate conservation, as\
    \ well as economic, environmental, and \nsocial viability. These have not been\
    \ the case due to various barriers. Precision agriculture is considered as one\
    \ \nof the farming practices that are efficient and safe to the environment achieved\
    \ through observation, \nmeasurement with quick response to variability’s on crops\
    \ by the farmer through the treatment of variable rates \nwith high precision\
    \ and accuracy [29].  \nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization,\
    \ food production must increase by 60% \nby 2050 to keep up with the world's rapid\
    \ population growth. Precision farming is seen as a long-term solution to \nthe\
    \ problem of food scarcity and unprofitable farm practices [19]. The environmental\
    \ impact has been alarming \nglobally because of various pollutants. Sociable\
    \ and sustainable agriculture entails excellent agricultural resource \nutilization\
    \ management for sustainability in fulfilling the food production demand, conserving\
    \ the environment, \nand natural resources. As a result, a policy framework that\
    \ guides the use and effects of poor agricultural \npractices on the environment\
    \ is required. This necessitates a transformation of our dominant conventional\
    \ \nfarming into smart farming through strategic alignment of agricultural product\
    \ development with the \nenvironment using smart technologies. Pollutants can\
    \ be reduced by preventing soil erosion, avoiding the \noveruse of fertilizers,\
    \ herbicides, and pesticides, protecting biodiversity, and conserving natural\
    \ resources [12]. \nThe study will benefit a variety of stakeholders, including\
    \ individual farmers, communities, government, and \nagricultural authorities.\
    \ It will provide insight and understanding to facilitate economic impact by providing\
    \ \ngood agricultural services, important data collection, analysis, and insight\
    \ exposure for decision-making and \nfarming practice management. These will boost\
    \ productivity, food security, and long-term sustainability. It aids \nstakeholders\
    \ in development while also improving their standard of living. It encourages\
    \ entrepreneurship and \njob creation. \n \n1.1 Sustainable Agriculture \nPrecision\
    \ agriculture significantly contributes to addressing agricultural challenges.\
    \ It can also contribute to a \nmore sustainable agricultural system while remaining\
    \ profitable [8]. Precision agriculture and the concept of \nsustainability are\
    \ inextricably linked. The term \"sustainability\" refers to the economic ability\
    \ to maintain \nconsistent productivity without jeopardizing the needs of future\
    \ generations. Sustainable agriculture improves \nenvironmental quality and resource-based\
    \ agriculture, where agriculture is based on basic human food and \neconomic viability,\
    \ thereby improving farmers' lifestyles and society. Sustainability has remained\
    \ a \ncomprehensive examination of the economic, environmental, and sociological\
    \ consequences of any expansion \n[6]. Agro-technology and precision farming,\
    \ as well as digital agriculture, use data-driven approaches to increase \nagricultural\
    \ productivity while minimizing environmental impacts [28].  \nPrecision agriculture's\
    \ critical success is hampered by factors such as a lack of training, a low return\
    \ on \ninvestment, high costs, and a lack of precision agriculture big data analytics\
    \ [45]. Precision farming collects real-\ntime data on farm elements such as crops,\
    \ air, and soil to protect the environment while also ensuring profits and \n\
    sustainability [1]. The incorporation of AI techniques in agricultural practices\
    \ has advanced aspects such as crop \nand soil health, irrigation systems, crop\
    \ disease identification, weed control, and recommended control measures \n[26].\
    \ Farming problems may be addressed by robotics and sensing technologies. As a\
    \ result, adopting a robotic \nagricultural system will have a significant impact\
    \ on crop production, efficiency, and sustainability [22]. \n \n1.2 Precision\
    \ agriculture \nPrecision agriculture has recently received a lot of attention\
    \ due to the world's ever-increasing demand for water \nand food [20]. Precision\
    \ agriculture is no exception to how information systems have influenced and shaped\
    \ \nevery aspect of our society [8]. Precision agriculture, according to [11],\
    \ is the “collection of real-time data from \nfarm variables and use of predictive\
    \ analytics for smart decisions to maximize yields, minimize environmental \n\
    impact, and reduce cost.” Precision agriculture's goal is to understand the soil\
    \ and crop qualities that are specific \nto each section of the field and to streamline\
    \ production inputs in small sections of the field [35]. According to \nJournal\
    \ of Information Engineering and Applications                                \
    \                                                                            \

    \ \nVol.13, No.1, 2023 \n \n21 \n[4], precision farming has the potential to provide\
    \ both economic and environmental benefits by reducing the use \nof water, fertilizers,\
    \ herbicides, and pesticides, as well as farm machinery. Thereby resolving both\
    \ the economic \nand climate change issues that currently plague production agriculture\
    \ precision agriculture is a field in which \ntechnology can be used to effectively\
    \ manage agriculture by understanding the temporal and spatial changes in \nsoil,\
    \ crop, production, and management via innovative techniques [45]. The Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technology \nplays an important role in precision farming by\
    \ driving the total market value, which is expected to be around \n$4.7 billion\
    \ by 2021. Despite an increase in research and novel projects in smart farming\
    \ projects, agriculture as \nan industry has been slow to adopt emerging M2M and\
    \ IoT technologies in comparison to other industries. \nSmart farming necessitates\
    \ the incorporation of sensor technologies capable of collecting data from the\
    \ crop, soil, \nanimal behavior, tractor status, and a variety of environmental\
    \ characteristics. Sensor data from IoT computing \nand analytics can provide\
    \ a farmer with valuable information on weather conditions, forecasts, yield prediction,\
    \ \ncrop monitoring, animal and plant disease detection, and crop monitoring [33].\
    \  \nPrecision Agriculture enables more efficient use of inputs (such as seed,\
    \ pesticide, fertilizer, or herbicide), \nnew efficient tillage equipment operation,\
    \ better crop and field measurements, and improved management \ndecisions [4],\
    \ [35]. The use of Smart greenhouses encourages crop cultivation with a minimum\
    \ of human \nintervention by constantly monitoring climatic conditions such as\
    \ humidity, luminosity, temperature, and soil \nmoisture, generating automated\
    \ actions based on the assessed changes, and enacting corrective mechanisms to\
    \ \nmaintain the most valuable conditions for development [1]. Deep Learning's\
    \ contribution to improving precision \nagriculture includes the following: 1)\
    \ Optimal control of the agricultural production system 2) Management of \nthe\
    \ agricultural economic system, Agriculture information processing, and smart\
    \ agriculture machinery \nequipment [44]. Growing agricultural technology has\
    \ enabled the use of high-precision sensors to remotely \nmonitor nutrients, water,\
    \ humidity, light, and temperature. The collected data is exposed through an advanced\
    \ \nanalysis using robust algorithms to aid in prediction processes and strategic\
    \ decision-making. Machine learning \nand deep learning technologies are important\
    \ in precision agriculture because they enable computers to become \nintelligent\
    \ through the development of image and video processing algorithms [9]. Information\
    \ and \ncommunication technologies (ICT) are a tool for promoting industrial transformations.\
    \ It is expected that the \navailability of analytics and modern farming techniques\
    \ will increase agricultural production output to 60% by \n2030. Agriculture has\
    \ been influenced by information technology, which has improved cost reduction,\
    \ efficiency, \nand sustainability [26]. Precision agriculture is a method of\
    \ managing farm practices that involve the use of \nvarious technologies such\
    \ as remote sensors, RFID, and cameras to achieve the proximal collection of key\
    \ data \nin real-time. Using data analytics strategies and other intelligent technologies,\
    \ these can be converted into \ninformation insights. Farmers can then use this\
    \ information to optimize their input returns, improve their \nefficiency, and\
    \ reduce their environmental impact. Precision agriculture can be defined as \"\
    applying the right \ntreatment in the right place at the right time.\" It is a\
    \ collection of IT artifacts that includes information systems, \nsmart sensors,\
    \ and improved machinery with cognizance management for production optimization\
    \ via tracking \nand monitoring of uncertainties and variability in agricultural\
    \ structures. It is a concept for managing farm \nactivities that are based on\
    \ observation, measurement, and response to any internal or external field variation\
    \ in \ncrops [13]. Precision agriculture employs IoT, deep learning, predictive\
    \ analytics, and AI-based technologies to \ndetect plant diseases, pests, and\
    \ poor plant nutrition in the field [11]. Precision agriculture enables efficient\
    \ \nobservation and close monitoring of crops as they grow by using information\
    \ collected directly from the field \n(such as weather or soil condition). It\
    \ is also known as satellite farming [32]. Precision agriculture necessitates\
    \ \nthe collection and interpretation of detailed field data to account for variability\
    \ in productivity. New technologies, \nsuch as wireless sensor networks, are now\
    \ assisting in the real-time streaming of data for strategic decision-\nmaking.\
    \ Sensor networks are used in agriculture for a variety of reasons, including\
    \ 1) Agriculture with pinpoint \naccuracy 2) Consumer advertisement 3) Plant growth\
    \ optimization 4) Farm surveillance 5) Research 6) Farming \neducation and training\
    \ 7) Farm administration [27]. \n \n2. IoT Technologies in Agriculture \nThe Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) entailed the connection of objects via RFID [36]. It is no longer\
    \ a buzzword, but it \nis being used practically all over the world as a result\
    \ of the advancement and use of devices such as mobile, \ndistributed systems,\
    \ embedded systems, cloud computing, ubiquitous communication, and big data analytics.\
    \ It \nenables physical object interconnection over a network, sensing, information\
    \ collection, sharing, and analysis, all \nof which aid in decision making, planning,\
    \ and management [40]. Precision farming makes use of smart \ntechnologies such\
    \ as IoT and big data analytics. It can handle farming problems adequately by\
    \ monitoring crops, \nsoil, environment, irrigation, and fertilization with IoT\
    \ sensors, RFID, and cameras. These IoT technologies \ncollect data and relay\
    \ it to data analytics for in-depth analysis. Farmers receive the analyzed data\
    \ via devices \nsuch as smartphones. The data helps farmers manage crop varieties,\
    \ phenotypes, and selection, crop performance, \nsoil quality, pH level, irrigation,\
    \ and fertilizer application quantity [19]. With the use of IoT, farmers will\
    \ find \nthat agricultural problems are a thing of the past. It plays an important\
    \ role in gathering relevant information [32]. \nJournal of Information Engineering\

    \ that consists of three components: 1) the monitoring sensors; 2) the sensing\
    \ box and 3) the \navailable interfaces. They are intended to provide soil data\
    \ that is critical for increasing crop yield. The soil \nhumidity, pH, temperature,\

    \ \n3.1 Big Data Analytics (BDA) \nCurrently, big data analytics is being increasingly\
    \ adopted to meet the evolving needs of big data technologies \nacross a wide\
    \ range of topics. Big data's approachability, accessibility, and rapid emergence\
    \ have fueled \nconsistent technological developments and applications [17]. Big\
    \ data is defined as a large data set that can be \nstructured, semi-structured,\
    \ or unstructured and collected, analyzed, distributed, and managed for informed\
    \ \ndecision-making. The data sources for BDA are incorporated through the integration\
    \ of IoT devices (RFID and \nsensors) within a network-enabled environment. The\
    \ BDA enables knowledgeable insights to be extracted from \nmassive IoT data sets\
    \ through the application of data mining approaches aimed at predicting, identifying\
    \ patterns, \ncorrelations, trends, and decision making. The massive amounts of\
    \ data generated by IoT have made a \nsignificant contribution to the vast field\
    \ of big data. Big data characteristics include the 5 Vs: volume, veracity, \n\
    variety, value, and velocity [30], [31]. Big data provides predictive insights\
    \ into farming practices, drives real-\ntime effective decisions, and redesigns\
    \ business processes to create game-changing business models [41]. The \nsmart\
    \ decision made possible by data analytics results in less waste of resources\
    \ such as water, pesticides, \nfertilizer, and so on [11].  \nThe BDA is responsible\
    \ for capturing, storing, analyzing, searching, and identifying hidden patterns\
    \ in the \ncollected data. As a result, BDA necessitates the use of (a) tools\
    \ for classification and clustering; (b) techniques \nfor data mining, machine\
    \ learning, and statistical analysis; and (c) technologies like Hadoop and Spark.\
    \ It aids in \naccurately forecasting and decision-making in agricultural practices\
    \ [1]. Adoption and optimization of \ninnovation and technologies will help to\
    \ ensure the long-term viability of precision farming through better \npractices\
    \ and increased productivity. These can be realized by measuring, storing, and\
    \ analyzing data to improve \nyield quality; managing cost revenues through crop\
    \ risk probability and minimization, and adopting improved \npreventive care methods\
    \ to increase productivity satisfaction [51]. Adoption of IoT Big Data is critical\
    \ in farm \nmanagement practices such as crop imaging, irrigation, soil analysis\
    \ (Acidity, PH), pesticide and herbicide \napplication, fertilizers, temperature,\
    \ and moisture monitoring [2]. Precision agriculture enables efficient \nobservation\
    \ and close monitoring of crops as they grow by using information collected directly\
    \ from the field \n(such as weather or soil condition). It is also known as satellite\
    \ farming [32].  \nThere is a disconnect between research and practice. There\

    \ for farmers to understand crop \nproduction with the incorporation of technology\
    \ and innovation. A farmer focuses on new techniques and \napproaches based on\
    \ individual perceptions such as resource availability, experience, age, education\
    \ level, and \nrisk management attitude [29]. Adoption of IoT big data technologies\
    \ can have a positive economic impact by \nfacilitating the provision of good\
    \ agricultural services, important data collection, analysis, and the dissemination\
    \ \nof insights that assist farmers in making informed and correct decisions about\
    \ farming practices and management. \nThese will increase farmer productivity,\
    \ and a ready market will allow farmers to sell their products and use \nthem\
    \ for development while also improving their livelihood. It encourages entrepreneurship\
    \ and job creation \n[51]. The government contributes significantly to the success\
    \ or failure of agriculture by encouraging farmers to \nbe risk-averse. Factors\
    \ such as drought, heavy rain, pest and disease infestations, or poor seed quality\
    \ contribute \nto the high risk. The government must provide full intervention\
    \ to farmers, such as input subsidies, permits, rates, \nirrigation facilitation,\
    \ and training and sensitization for the adoption of modern farming technologies\
    \ for high \nyields and productivity [2]. The expansion of big climate data and\
    \ its analytics has resulted in the widespread use \nof smart information management\
    \ systems, precision agriculture, and intelligent automatic agriculture [17].\
    \  \n \n3.2 Deep Learning  \nAccording to [16], deep learning technologies are\
    \ now being used in a variety of agricultural and farming \nsystems. Autonomous\
    \ weed identification can aid in weed control, resulting in higher yields. Weed\
    \ detection in \ncrops using imagery is a difficult task because weeds and crops\
    \ have similar colors, shapes, and textures during \nthe growth stage. Deep learning\
    \ is an important branch of machine learning. Deep learning is a type of artificial\
    \ \nintelligence that is trained on data sets and then learns on its own, and\
    \ it is at the heart of many technologies [39]. \nAside from image segmentation,\
    \ object detection, and identification, deep learning algorithms have several\
    \ \nadvantages over previous machine learning approaches. Machine learning algorithms\
    \ can be used in precision \nagriculture decision support tools to recognize statistical\
    \ correlations rather than causal explanations. It takes into \naccount a set\
    \ of entities such as crop yields in addition to data characteristics (training\
    \ data) linked to entities \nsuch as weather conditions and soil conditions to\
    \ predict the outcome [5]. Deep learning is defined as an \n“algorithm-assisted\
    \ structure that mimics human learning” [9]. Robotic vision is based on machine\
    \ learning from \nreal-world datasets using methods such as deep neural networks,\
    \ allowing robots to share their knowledge by \nlearning from Big Data [10]. Machine\
    \ Learning is an Artificial Intelligence subset that can detect patterns and \n\
    anomalies in data generated by smart sensors [41].  \nDeep Learning algorithms\
    \ have been used in agriculture in a variety of ways. Recurrent Neural Networks\
    \ \n(RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks\
    \ (GAN) are examples of \nthese (GAN). Deep Neural Networks can extract their\
    \ features, allowing them to prompt multifaceted \nrelationships or patterns amongst\
    \ the data [52].  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are Deep Learning \nmodels\
    \ that interact with images by extracting features or objects and learning to\
    \ differentiate between them [18]. \nDeep learning enables computational models\
    \ with multiple layers of processing that represent multiple data \nlevels of\
    \ abstraction. The layering aspect is learned from data rather than created by\
    \ humans using a general-\npurpose learning technique. Several Deep Learning algorithms\
    \ rely heavily on the Back Propagation Neural \nNetwork. Weather forecasting,\
    \ plant disease detection, image translation, fruit counting, land classification,\
    \ \nobstacle detection, plant classification, weed identification, animal behavior\
    \ classification, and yield prediction \nare all areas where deep learning is\
    \ used in agriculture  [44], [9]. \n \nFigure 2: Deep Learning Approach (Adapted\
    \ from [52]) \n \n4. Typical Application Areas \nPest Management is one of the\
    \ most common applications of smart technologies in precision agriculture. Insect\
    \ \npest infestation in agriculture has been a major issue for farmers, resulting\
    \ in significant economic losses. These \ncan be mitigated by the development\
    \ of computerized systems that identify active pests and advise on control \n\
    measures [3]. Modern and intelligent technology, such as the use of drones, can\
    \ independently eradicate pests \nand selectively target agrichemicals, reducing\

    \ and human health complications. Nonetheless, technological advancements have\
    \ enabled the \nuse of artificial intelligence for safe and risk-free herbicide\
    \ applications. The use of a rule-based expert system; \nmachine vision; neural\
    \ network models (backpropagation, counter propagation, and radial basis function-based\
    \ \nmodel); and image analysis are among the approaches that are now taking center\
    \ stage in weed identification and \nelimination [47]. Artificial intelligence\
    \ sensors can detect and target weeds before determining which herbicides \nare\
    \ needed and when. As a result, we save money by not using as many herbicides\
    \ and we reduce the number of \ntoxins in our food. Machine vision can aid in\
    \ site-specific crop management by detecting and distinguishing the \npresence\
    \ of weeds in the crop and identifying the weed for the appropriate chemical to\
    \ spray [27].  \nAgricultural Product Monitoring:  Food monitoring and quality\

    \ or aid in the infestation of insects, microorganisms, rodents, and other pests,\
    \ all of \nwhich harm the quality and quantity of food products. IoT, AI, and\
    \ data analytics will be used to improve \nagricultural product storage [11].\
    \ Crop disease management: Crop diseases reduce crop productivity yield. \nPrecision\
    \ agriculture is the adaptation of a computer-aided system that can assist in\
    \ the identification of crop \ndiseases and proposed control measures. Various\
    \ systems and algorithms for predicting, classifying, detecting, \nand controlling\
    \ crop diseases have been proposed. Rule-based systems, a fuzzy logic-based model,\
    \ an artificial \nneural network-based model, an image processing model, and the\
    \ k-means segmentation algorithm are among \nthe techniques used [3]. Weather\
    \ Monitoring: The growth of plants is dependent on weather conditions and \nfactors\
    \ such as sunlight and rainwater, which are now naturally unpredictable as a result\
    \ of human pollution and \nglobal warming. The new technologies can monitor and\
    \ predict the weather, providing farmers with useful \ninformation to help them\
    \ avoid unfavorable conditions that can reduce crop yields [42]. Irrigation Management:\
    \ \nIoT-based smart irrigation systems help improve irrigation efficacy by reducing\
    \ water loss and conserving \ncurrent water resources [1].  \nYield Prediction:\
    \ The prediction model is critical for precision agriculture analytics because\
    \ it forecasts \ncrop yield, which is critical for marketing strategies and crop\
    \ cost estimation. A backpropagation learning \nalgorithm of an artificial neural\
    \ network has been used to forecast yield based on soil parameters, atmospheric\
    \ \ninputs, and fertilizer consumption [3]. Management of Soils: Soil management\
    \ is a critical area in agriculture that \nrequires attention because improper\
    \ soil management results in a loss of crop yield and quality. Soil minerals and\
    \ \npH levels must be measured and monitored for plants to grow healthier as a\
    \ result of proper soil minerals and pH \nlevels [42]. Any farmer will find the\
    \ soil to be a fascinating resource. The use of large harvesters has greatly \n\
    damaged and compacted soil, and the overuse of agrochemicals, such as nitrogen\
    \ fertilizer, has harmed the \nenvironment. Aside from autonomous technologies,\
    \ the use of robotics could be of great assistance and relief to \nfarmers. Drone\
    \ data analytics are used to make smarter nitrogen fertilizer applications for\
    \ healthy vegetation. \nBonirob (a car-sized robot) is used to measure soil value\
    \ indicators using various sensors and components, \nincluding a moisture sensor\
    \ and a penetrometer that can evaluate soil compaction [22]. Artificial intelligence\
    \ \ntechniques can help with supervised activities such as crop and land suitability\
    \ mapping, stem water intake \nestimation, soil water content management, soil\
    \ moisture, and rainfall prediction [3]. \nJournal of Information Engineering\

    \ as tractors, must be managed to \nimprove agricultural efficiency, competitiveness,\
    \ and sustainability. Integrating these types of machinery with \nsmart technologies\
    \ will aid in reducing negative environmental effects, increasing soil productivity,\
    \ and \npromoting economic yields. Smart agricultural machines are quick, versatile,\
    \ precise, and intelligent, with low \ncarbon dioxide emissions and bioenergy\
    \ utilization [1]. IoT-enabled agricultural machinery can boost crop \nproductivity\
    \ while reducing grain losses. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems\
    \ and global \nnavigation satellite systems can improve machinery because they\
    \ can be driven in autopilot mode. Machines \nwith vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles,\
    \ and robots can be controlled remotely, allowing farmers to map their \nfield\
    \ management practices such as fertilizing, irrigation, nutrition, and so on [11].\

    \ \nAdvances in technological services, new business models, and markets drive\
    \ significant GDP growth [45]. \nRadical advancements in information systems,\
    \ such as satellites, the internet, mobile phones, and social media, \nare now\
    \ being used to solve agricultural challenges. Artificial intelligence and the\
    \ Internet of Things are \nrevolutionizing agricultural activities, addressing\
    \ productivity issues such as weather unpredictability, crop loss, \nand economic\
    \ stagnation [26]. These IoT technologies collect data and relay it to data analytics\
    \ for in-depth \nanalysis. Farmers receive the analyzed data via devices such\
    \ as smartphones. The data helps farmers manage \ncrop varieties, phenotypes,\
    \ and selection, crop performance, soil quality, pH level, irrigation, and fertilizer\
    \ \napplication quantity [19]. \nAs of the popularity of IoT, it can now be used\
    \ in a variety of fields (i.e. smart home, smart agriculture, \nsmart city, smart\
    \ health-care, smart logistics, smart transport, smart energy, and so on) It is\
    \ estimated that the \nworld's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from\
    \ 7.7 billion today [20]. This raises concerns about food \nsecurity, in addition\
    \ to global warming, which has made climatic conditions uncertain, scarcity of\
    \ natural \nresources, and arid land, which are the most significant challenges\
    \ faced by the majority of countries. This \nnecessitates the implementation of\
    \ novel and strategic agricultural production methods. As a result, for future\
    \ \nfood sustainability, most countries are opting for precision farming with\
    \ the use of both IoT and data analytics. \nThis will enable smart agriculture,\
    \ which is expected to improve operational efficiency, crop quality, and crop\
    \ \nyields [11]. Big data's role is to extract valuable insights from massive\
    \ amounts of heterogeneous data about crop \ngrowth and other parameters measured\

    \ of Sustainable Precision Farming  \nThe adoption of innovative technologies\
    \ in precision agriculture has not been easy. Industrial agriculture \ntechniques\
    \ are already heavily criticized for harming the environment, according to [8].\
    \ Examples of such effects \ninclude: I Monocultures reduce biodiversity in plants\
    \ and animals. (ii) The use of chemical pesticides and \nfertilizers pollutes\
    \ the soil and groundwater. (iii) Soil degrades much faster than it can be replenished.\
    \ (iv) \nExtinction of fish. (v) Excessive use of water and fossil fuels. (vi)\
    \ The global population is expected to increase \nsignificantly, increasing global\
    \ food demand. (vii) Fertilizer and pesticide prices are also projected to increase.\
    \ \nAccording to [35], the following are the barriers to precision farming implementation\
    \ in developing countries: a) \nThe cultures and perceptions of users. b) A scarcity\
    \ of technical expertise on the local level. c) Taking into \naccount system heterogeneity\
    \ and market imperfections. d) The availability, quality, and cost of data. e)\
    \ A small \nfarm size and a lack of success stories. f) Knowledge and technology\
    \ gaps. h) Land ownership, infrastructure, \nand institutional constraints. \n\
    Among the factors impeding full implementation among farmers are Concerns about\
    \ privacy and trust: The \npresence of malware attacks and data thefts is a risk\
    \ factor for connected systems. Because of their presence in \nthe complex IoT\
    \ system, these malicious third-party programs are difficult to detect and remove.\
    \ There is an \nurgent need for a strong security and policy framework for agricultural\
    \ IoT and other technologies for systems to \npromote trust and be more acceptable\
    \ to customers [43], [50]. Agronomical challenges include a lack of basic \ninformation,\
    \ limited sampling and inspection procedures, information misuse, a lack of qualified\
    \ agronomic \nservices, and a lack of site-specific fertilizer references [25].\
    \ Profitability issue: The inability to demonstrate that \nthe use of precision\
    \ agriculture technology improves farm profitability through the strategy of “right\
    \ quantity of \ncrop inputs in the right location at the right time” [34], [21].\
    \ Lack of skills: Precision agriculture is primarily \ninformation-intensive and\
    \ technology-driven, necessitating extensive technical skills gained through education\
    \ \nand training to analyze data and exhaustively interpret information derived\
    \ from data mining techniques and \nalgorithms [37],[25]. Cost challenge: Precision\
    \ agriculture management activities such as the use of machinery \nsuch as driverless\
    \ tractors with sensors that are suitable for large-scale farmers are not cost-effective\
    \ for \ndomestic farmers. Financial constraints and a lack of credit for technological\
    \ machinery and inputs are deterring \nfarmers from adopting precision farming\
    \ [50].  \nLack of broadband infrastructure: Due to the unfavorable landscape,\
    \ internet connectivity in remote rural \nareas in developing countries is unreliable.\
    \ As a result, improved network performance and bandwidth speeds are \nrequired\
    \ in these areas. Precision agriculture systems located in farm environments with\
    \ poor connectivity \ncannot effectively share data with other systems on the\
    \ same farm. The issues with GPS signals and agro-\nsensors/gateways have an impact\
    \ on cloud services in terms of data transmission and storage [48]. Technical\
    \ \nchallenges: Any mechanical failure in technological equipment, such as hardware\
    \ or IoT sensors, causes serious \ncrop damage. For example, if a smart irrigation\
    \ sensor fails, crops may be under-watered or over-watered, \naffecting crop growth.\
    \ Food security can also be jeopardized if storage technologies fail or if there\
    \ is a power \noutage with no backup power [25], [48]. Perception of utilitarianism:\
    \ Farmers' negative attitudes toward the use \nof precision agriculture technologies\
    \ in comparison to traditional farming methods. This has had a significant \n\
    impact on adoption rates, necessitating the need for farmer education, sensitization,\
    \ and awareness [25]. \n \n7. Critical Success Factors for Implementation of Precision\
    \ Agriculture \nAgricultural service providers are filling the gap in assisting\
    \ farms in making use of the data they collect and \noptimizing it for strategies\
    \ such as variable rate application, zone-based soil sampling, soil electrical\
    \ \nconductivity mapping, cloud solutions, and areas-based plant tissue testing\
    \ [14]. Adoption of new technologies: \nSmart devices and methods for detecting\
    \ and monitoring biotic factors such as weeds and diseases must be \nimplemented.\
    \ This technology aids in the management of soil moisture as well as variable\
    \ irrigation applications \n[23]. Transdisciplinary approach: By combining several\
    \ competencies and academic fields, ICT can make a \nsignificant contribution\
    \ to long-term sustainable development. These disciplines must collaborate to\
    \ help \ndevelop sustainable agricultural development through a transdisciplinary\
    \ approach that has the potential to \nimpact society on multiple levels [29].\
    \ The assistance provided by governments and the private sectors: As a \nresult,\
    \ early adoption assistance from governments and the private sector is critical\
    \ [35]. \nTraining programs: Farmers must be trained in the proper use of innovations\
    \ and consultation, particularly \ndata, software management, and analysis resources.\
    \ This can instill confidence that today's precision agriculture \ntools provide\
    \ the most critical insights [23]. Bringing together temporal and spatial data:\
    \ Bringing together \ntemporal and spatial output data can help farmers and advisers\
    \ manage fields or farms due to differences in \nagricultural average yield and\
    \ variation to improve nutrient uptake [14]. Data quality assurance is required\
    \ \nbecause quality data must be handled and retrieved. It is necessary to ensure\
    \ the use of predictable or precise \nsensors for smarter agronomic data for inputs\
    \ explaining receptiveness under various environmental pressures \n[23].  \nJournal\

    \ assessed the application of various technologies in precision agriculture. Farmers\
    \ will find agricultural \nproblems obsolete as a result of the use of IoT, Big\
    \ Data, and Deep Learning. Big data provides predictive \ninsights into farming\
    \ practices, drives real-time effective decisions, and redesigns business processes\
    \ to create \ngame-changing business models. Weather forecasting, plant disease\
    \ detection, image translation, fruit counting, \nland classification, obstacle\
    \ detection, plant classification, weed identification, animal behavior classification,\
    \ \nand yield prediction are all areas where deep learning is used in agriculture.\
    \ The study also looks at the typical \napplication areas and challenges in precision\
    \ agriculture adoption. The study examines the critical success \nfactors for\
    \ implementing precision agriculture. According to the findings, technological\
    \ advancements, new \nbusiness models, and markets drive significant GDP growth.\
    \ The study recommends the adoption and \noptimization of innovations and technologies\
    \ that will enable precision farming to be sustainable through quality \npractices\
    \ and increased productivity. \n \nReferences \n[1]   Alreshidi, E. (2019). Smart\
